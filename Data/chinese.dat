0"gWhile it is young, it uses the nutrients that are stored in the seed on its back in order to grow."ûTo support its weight, Ivysaur's legs and trunk grow thick and strong. If it spends more time lying in the sunlight, it's a sign that the bud will bloom soon."_Its plant blooms when it is absorbing solar energy. It stays on the move to seek sunlight."tFrom the time it is born, a flame burns at the tip of its tail. Its life would end if the flame were to go out."_In the rocky mountains where Charmeleon live, their fiery tails shine at night like stars."fIf Charizard becomes furious, the flame at the tip of its tail flares up in a whitish-blue color."ûIts shell is not just for protection. Its rounded shape and the grooves on its surface minimize resistance in water, enabling Squirtle to swim at high speeds."ûIts large tail is covered with rich, thick fur that deepens in color with age. The scratches on its shell are evidence of this Pok√©mon's toughness in battle."dThe jets of water it spouts from the rocket cannons on its shell can punch through thick steel."èIts voracious appetite compels it to devour leaves bigger than itself without hesitation. It releases a terribly strong odor from its antennae."hA steel-hard shell protects its tender body. It quietly endures hardships while awaiting evolution."dWater-repellent powder on its wings enables it to collect honey, even in the heaviest of rains."fPredators not warned off by its brightly-colored body are jabbed with the toxic barb on its head."¢It remains virtually immobile while it clings to a tree. However, on the inside, it busily prepares for evolution. This is evident from how hot its shell becomes."rIt prefers hit-and-run attacks using its powerful poison stingers, trying to evade blows to its fragile body."ñIt has an extremely sharp sense of direction. It can unerringly return home to its nest, however far it may be removed from its familiar surroundings."§This Pok√©mon flies around, patrolling its large territory. If its living space is violated, it shows no mercy in thoroughly punishing the foe with its sharp claws."dIt spreads its gorgeous wings wide to intimidate enemies. It races through the skies at Mach 2."YCautious in the extreme, its hardy vitality lets it live in any kind of environment."iWith its long fangs, this surprisingly violent Pok√©mon can gnaw away even thick concrete with ease."vFarmers whose fields are troubled by bug Pok√©mon appreciate Spearow for its vigorous appetite and look after it."ãIts long neck and elongated beak are ideal for catching prey in soil or water. It deftly moves this extended and skinny beak to pluck prey."íEkans curls itself up in a spiral while it rests. Assuming this position allows it to quickly respond to a threat from any direction with a glare."jTransfixing prey with the face-like pattern on its belly, it binds and poisons the frightened victim."fThis intelligent Pok√©mon roasts hard berries with electricity to make them tender enough to eat."êIf it stores too much electricity, its behavior turns aggressive. To avoid this, it occasionally discharges excess energy and calms itself down."àIt loves to bathe in the grit of dry, sandy areas. By sand bathing, this Pok√©mon rids itself of dirt and moisture clinging to its body."xIts claws and horns often break off. The broken claws and horns can be used to carve plows for tilling farm fields."úIts highly toxic barbs are thought to have developed as protection for this small-bodied Pok√©mon. When enraged, it releases a horrible toxin from its horn."õWhen Nidorina are with friends or family, they keep their barbs tucked away to prevent hurting each other. It becomes nervous if separated from the others."èIt pacifies offspring by placing them in the gaps between the spines on its back. The spines will never secrete poison while young are present."wIts large ears are flapped like wings when it is listening to distant sounds. It extends toxic barbs when angered."áIt's nervous and quick to act aggressively. The potency of its poison increases along with the level of adrenaline present in its body."èWhen it goes on a rampage, it's impossible to control. But in the presence of a Nidoqueen it's lived with for a long time, Nidoking calms down."ùOn every night of a full moon they come out to play. When dawn arrives, they return to their quiet mountain retreats and sleep nestled up against each other."öA Clefable uses its wings to skip lightly as if it were flying. Its bouncy step lets it even walk on water. On quiet, moonlit nights, it strolls on lakes."ÄFrom its mouth spew flames that seem to resemble the spirits of the deceased. Some people mistakenly think this fire is a ghost."^Legend has it that this mystical Pok√©mon was formed when nine saints coalesced into one."{By freely changing the wavelength of its voice, Jigglypuff sings a mysterious melody sure to make any listener sleepy."óThe surfaces of its saucerlike eyes are always covered with a thin layer of tears. If any dust gets in this Pok√©mon's eyes, it is quickly washed away."çTheir skin is so thin that they'll be burned if sunlight hits them. When it gets cold out, they gather together to warm one another's bodies."}Its thick fangs are hollow like straws, making them unexpectedly fragile. These fangs are specialized for sucking blood."eIf exposed to moonlight, it starts to move. It roams far and wide at night to scatter its seeds."üA horribly noxious honey drools from its mouth.

You lose a battle if that happens to your Pok√©mon."í1. Have as many Pok√©mon as you can. 2. Level up your Pok√©mon as much as you can. 3. Abuse type matchups. 4. Start battles with healthy Pok√©mon."Team Size"ñYou can have a maximum of 6 Pok√©mon with you at any time. This is known as your 'Team'. You can store extra Pok√©mon using the PC in any Pok√©Center."Levels"©Each Pok√©mon has a level from 1 to 70. A Pok√©mon's level determines its stats as well as what moves it could learn. Reaching high enough levels also unlocks Evolution."èTypes are strong or weak against other types. Having a variety of different types on your team helps you take advantage of these relationships."Healing your Pok√©mon"yHeal your Pok√©mon at Pok√©Centers between battles. You can often use the Aid Kit instead to save on traveling time."Who goes first?"âIn battle, the Pok√©mon with the higher speed stat gets to use their move first. Some moves modify this. Speed ties are decided randomly."Attacking vs Status"~Attacking moves deal damage. Status moves do not. Status moves are notated by a Yin/Yang symbol (White and Black intermixing)."Physical vs Special"§Attacking moves are split into Physical moves, and Special moves. Each of these categories uses different stats to determine how much damage is dealt to the target."Physical Moves"•Physical moves are notated by the symbol of a smashing fist. Their damage is based on the Attack (Atk) stat of the attacker and the Defense (Def) stat of the target."Special Moves"´Special moves are notated by the symbol of a splash. Their damage is based on the Special Attack (Sp. Atk) of the attacker and the Special Defense (Sp. Def) of the target."Targeting"µMost moves target only a single Pok√©mon, but many can target multiple Pok√©mon at once. Some moves differ in how far they can target in the bigger battle styles (doubles, triples)."Move Types"£Every move has a type. Attacking moves deal different amounts of damage to different Pok√©mon based on those Pok√©mon's types. This is called 'type effectiveness'."Same-Type Bonus"öPok√©mon deal 50% more damage with moves the share a type with them. For example, a Raichu deals 50% more damage with an Electric move than a Normal move."Learning Moves"äPok√©mon learn new moves as they level up. They can also learn moves from the 'Move Tutors' who sit in the left side of every Pok√©Center."Base Power"èMoves with higher Base Power deal more damage. Some moves deal variable Base Power depending on the situation. Status moves have no base power."ñAccuracy is a move's chance of hitting. Most moves have 100% accuracy. Some effects can raise accuracy to let you use low-accuracy moves consistently."Power Points"äPower Points, or PP, is a number which limits how many times a move can be used. Healing at a Pok√©Center or with the Aid Kit restores PP."óEach Pok√©mon has type weakness and type resistances based on its own type. eg. Water deals double damage to Fire, and Fire deals half damage to Water."Type Combinations"±When a Pok√©mon has two types, its type weaknesses and resistances multiply. A Pok√©mon can be double weak or double resistant, or immune even though one of their types is weak."Normal Effective"SNormal Effective is the default effectiveness of all moves against a Pok√©mon."Super Effective"USuper Effective moves deal double the damage compared to normal effective moves."Hyper Effective"äHyper Effective moves deal quadruple the damage compared to normal effective moves. This happens when a Pok√©mon is double weak to a type."Not Very Effective"VNot Very Effective moves deal half the damage compared to normal effective moves."Barely Effective"íBarely Effective moves deal one quarter the damage compared to normal effective moves. This happens when a Pok√©mon is double resistant to a type."Ineffective"ØIneffective moves deal no damage at all. This can happen if one of a Pok√©mon's types has an immunity to the attacking move type, even if the other is neutral (or even weak!)."Looking Up Matchups"ëThe 5th and 6th pages of a MasterDex entry show that Pok√©mon's type matchups. Open the MasterDex in battle to check matchups if you're not sure."Psychic vs Steel"PPsychic is now Super-Effective vs Steel. Think of magicians bending spoons."Poison vs Water"RPoison is now Super-Effective vs Water. Think of chemicals polluting a river."Bug vs Fairy"LBug is now Super-Effective vs Fairy. Think of insects scaring children."Grass resistances"UGrass now resists Fairy, Psychic, and Ghost. Think of incense warding off magic."Ice resistances"iIce now resists Flying and Ground. Ice is Super-Effective against those types, so it's only natural!"Other changes"`Rock resists Ice. Fairy resists Dragon. Fairy is neutral against Fire. Bug resists Psychic."Why Get More?"ùHaving choices of Pok√©mon is important when facing challenges. A team of six is a bare minimum--it's best to catch more and pull them from the PC as needed."Methods of Aquiring"ãThe two main methods of acquiring Pok√©mon are catching them from the wild, and receiving them from other Trainers through gifts or trades."Catching Basics"ÆWild Pok√©mon will attack you if you walk through patches of grass, dark ground in caves, or other wild terrain. You can catch these Pok√©mon by throwing Pok√© Balls at them." Increase Catch Chance pt. 1"õCatching a Pok√©mon isn't guaranteed. It's easier to catch Pok√©mon when their health has been lowered by your attacks, or when they have a status ailment." Increase Catch Chance pt. 2"±Every time a Pok√©mon breaks out of a ball, it'll be slightly easier to catch for the rest of the battle. You can check what your current catch chance is in the Pok√© Ball menu."Finding Wild Pok√©mon"™Use the DexNav to get information on which Pok√©mon are available where you are. You can also use it to find more Pok√©mon of a species that you've already caught one of."Trades"éThroughout the world there will be people offering trades for Pok√©mon. Usually they want a different Pok√©mon, but sometimes they want money."What are Stats?"gStats, short for Statistics, are the numbers which determine how your Pok√©mon performs in battle."Checking Stats"äCheck your Pok√©mon's stats by looking at the second page of their summary screen, accessible through the Pok√©mon menu in the pause menu."Stat Factors"òYour Pok√©mon's stats are calculated from a combination of their species' 'Base Stats', their own 'Style Points', and extra modifications during battle."Base Stats"≠Every species of Pok√©mon have base stats, which affect every Pok√©mon of that species. e.g. Every Raichu will be fast because the Raichu species has a high Speed base stat."Style Points"îStyle Points are numbers which you can customize to change your Pok√©mon's stats. Style Points show as blue numbers on the stat page of the summary."Leveling and Evolution"ÖYour Pok√©mon's stats will increase every time they level up. When Pok√©mon evolve, their stats change (almost always they increase)."Accuracy and Evasion"êAccuracy and Evasion are two stats which are only active in battle, starting at 100% each. They are only modified by in-battle changing effects."Stat Steps"ìEffects can modify a Pok√©mon's stats during battle. These are called 'stat steps'. Stat steps multiply or divide the Pok√©mon's listed stat value."Bounds of Stat Steps"éStat steps start at 0, and can increase up to +12 (4x) and down to -12 (.25x). Stat steps are reset if you swap the Pok√©mon out or it faints."Checking Stat Steps"úYou can check the current stat steps of each Pok√©mon on the battlefield using the Info button. It lists the numerical step as well as resultant multiplier."What are abilities?"Abilities are special powers that Pok√©mon can have based on their species. Most Pok√©mon can have one of 2 possible abilities."Ability Effects"ãAbilities do a wide variety of different things. Understanding your team's abilities, and choosing the right ones, is important to winning."Checking Abilities"ãCheck your Pok√©mon's summary to see what ability they have. Use the MasterDex to read about the abilities of enemy Pok√©mon during battle."Choosing Abilities"êA Pok√©mon's ability is one of the two its species can have, randomly chosen when you get it. You can use Ability Capsules to swap to the other."Conditional Abilities"ÉMany abilities only do things under certain circumstances. Building around Weather and Room-synergy abilities is a common strategy."Effect Of Evolution"{A Pok√©mon's ability tends to stay the same when evolving, but can change. When this happens, the game will alert you."Defeating Abilities"ÉAn enemy Trainer's ability too much? Abilities like Neutralizing Gas, and moves like Gastro Acid, can suppress abilities in battle."Swapping Abilities"Moves like Skill Swap can be used to give a new ability to Pok√©mon during battle, enabling unique and creative team synergies."What are Held Items?"êHeld items are items which you can give your Pok√©mon to benefit them during battle. They can increase their damage, heal them, or other things."Equipping an item"ÜYou can give a Pok√©mon an item from your bag, or through the summary screen. Not all items do an effect when held, so read carefully."Berries"ÜBerries are a common held item. During battles, Pok√©mon will eat the berry to get a benefit. Get berries by picking from Berry Trees."Sitrus and Amwi Berry"£Sitrus Berry and Cado Berry are common berries which heal your Pok√©mon when at low health. If in doubt about what item to give a Pok√©mon, give them one of these."Rematerializer"~In Pok√©mon Tectonic, the Rematerializer regenerates held items which are consumed in battle. You'll never run out of berries!"Wild Held Items"hWild Pok√©mon can be found holding items. These items sometimes have held effects, but often don't."Getting More"ûYou will find more held items on the ground when traveling, or as gifts from people, or as the reward for defeating Avatars, or as purchasable items in shops." What are Status Conditions?"âStatus Conditions are ailments a Pok√©mon can have which hurt or restrict them. They remain after swapping out, and even between battles."Healing Status Conditions"`Status Conditions are removed when you heal at the Pok√©Center or when you use the Aid Kit."Status Immunity"áType immunities do not prevent status moves. However, some types give immunities to certain status conditions. Don't confuse these two!"çWhen burned, a Pok√©mon's Attack is reduced by 33%, and loses 1/8th HP every turn. Fire- and Ghost-types do the most burning. Fire is immune."Frostbite"ñWhen frostbitten, a Pok√©mon's Sp. Atk is reduced by 33%, and loses 1/8th HP every turn. Ice- and Flying-types do the most frostbiting. Ice is immune."ôWhen poisoned, a Pok√©mon loses 1/10th HP every turn. This doubles every 2 turns. Poison- and Grass-types do the most poisoning. Poison/Steel are immune."éWhen numbed, a Pok√©mon's Speed is halved, and it deals 25% less damage. Electric- and Fighting-types do the most numbing. Electric is immune."áWhen dizzied, a Pok√©mon takes 25% more attack damage, and its ability doesn't function. Psychic- and Fairy-types do the most dizzying."ñWhen leeched, a Pok√©mon loses 1/10th HP every turn, and its opponent(s) split that health. Bug- and Dark-types do the most leeching. Grass is immune."çA rarer status that causes a Pok√©mon to be unable to do anything for 2 turns. Psychic- and Grass-types put Pok√©mon to sleep the most often."What are Critical Hits?"zA critical hit deals 50% more damage than a regular hit. These naturally happen at random times on any damaging move.""How common are Critical Hits?"pThe base critical hit chance is 1 in 16. This chance can be raised by abilities, items, or special effects."Other Effects"ùCritical hits ignore stat steps (on the user or the target) that would lower their damage. They also ignore protective screens like Reflect and Light Screen."Preventing Criticals"üCertain abilities prevent critical hits against that Pokemon. The Lucky Chant effect and the Strategist tribe bonus also protect their side from critical hits."Guaranteed Criticals"ïSome moves or abilities are not random, but guarantee a critical hit under certain conditions. Otherwise, these act the same as random critical hits."}Avatars cannot perform random critical hits. However, they can perform guaranteed critical hits from moves or abilities."What are Tribes?"®Every Pok√©mon has 1-3 Tribes, decided by their species. Have 5 Pok√©mon of a shared Tribe on your team, and your entire team will receive that Tribe's bonus in battle!"Tribal Bonus"õTribal Bonuses are not identical: each Tribe provides a unique boon. With careful team composition, you can have 2 or even 3 Tribal Bonuses active at once!"Are they important?"îTribes are not required in any way to complete the game. They are simply an alternative team-building challenge to play with, like Single Type runs."What are Enemy Trainers?"îEnemy Trainers are the Pok√©mon Trainers you will battle throughout the game. Some block your path forwards (like Gym Leaders), others are optional."Detecting Trainers"îTrainers are people who have a companion Pok√©mon next to them. If a person doesn't have that, they either aren't a Trainer, or are an inactive one."Avoiding Trainers"üTrainers will challenge you if they see you within 4 tiles of them. Avoid them by going out of that distance, sneaking around them, or waiting until they move."Trainer Inactivity"≥When you defeat a Trainer, they will become inactive until the next time you heal at a Pok√©Center. This is indicated by them returning their companion Pok√©mon to its Pok√© Ball."Perfecting Fights"õIf you defeat a Trainer without any of your Pok√©mon fainting, you've 'perfected' the fight. They will leave forever and drop experience candy as a reward."Enemy Teams"õEnemy Trainers have their own teams of Pok√©mon with their own moves and held items. It's important to pay attention to these possibilities to win battles."Differences"ùThe typical trainer has 3 Pok√©mon, but Gym Leaders will have more. Trainers with more Pok√©mon also have more move variety and more items on their Pok√©mon."Pro Trainers"∞Pro Trainers are special Trainers, noted by their grey hair and black clothes. Their teams are always 6 Pok√©mon, all with items, and built around a Tribal Bonus. They're hard!"Trainer Behaviour"§Individual Trainers will always react to the same in-battle circumstances the same way. You can learn how to beat or even perfect a Trainer through trial and error."What are Avatars?"àAvatars are powerful enemy Pok√©mon with unique properties that you will fight and destroy during your adventure. They cannot be caught."Avatars are Healthy"rAvatars have two health bars, which means they have a lot of health. Much more than double the normal amount!"Multi-Move"}Avatars can move twice each turn. Their second move will happen after every battler has used their regular move for the turn."Two Statuses"{Avatars are large, and have room for up to two status conditions at a time. They can't have two of the same condition."HP-Based Effects"ÄEffects that damage based on a fraction of total HP are only one-sixth as powerful against avatars, compared to normal Pok√©mon."Primeval Moves"ùWhen a health bar is depleted, avatars will use a Primeval Move! Primeval Moves are powered-up versions of status moves, which also change the Avatar's type."Clean Slate"èBefore an Avatar uses a Primeval Move, they will also heal from any status conditions and reset any of their stat steps that have been lowered."Shields"çThe top of Avatars health bars starts Shielded. Shielded bars take 75% less damage. A shield is removed when the Avatar uses a Primeval Move."Attack Choice"|Avatars usually only have a few moves to choose from. They usually alternate between their moves on successive attacks."Target Choice"õA targeting reticle shows which of your battles the Avatar wants to attack. It will switch to another battler, however, if their attack is made impossible."Empowered Moves"âSome Avatars have Empowered attacks, which are powered-up versions of other attacks. They take up both of an Avatar's moves on that turn."Experience Reward"oWhen an Avatar is destroyed, every Pok√©mon on your team is given experience, even those that are fainted."Legendary Avatars"ìLegendary Avatars are unique. You fight them with 3 Pok√©mon, they have 3 HP bars, and they have more moves with more smarts about how to use them."What is the MasterDex?"^The MasterDex is an advanced encyclopedia about the 900+ Pok√©mon available in this game."Single MasterDex"ãAccess the MasterDex entry of a single Pok√©mon when looking at a Pok√©mon in the summary or the PC, or by using the Dex button in battles."Full MasterDex"óAccess the full MasterDex from your pause menu, or by pressing D when using the Dex button in battles (while it's waiting for you to select a battler)."Searching"úWhen in the MasterDex, you can press your Special keybind (default Shift or Z) to open the first search page.

Only one weather can be active at once."Weather Duration"¢Weathers last a certain number of turns. The length differs depending on what move or ability summoned the weather. The duration can be extended by certain items."Sunshine"ïSunshine lowers attack damage by 15% and prevents crits. Fire and Grass-type moves/Pok√©mon are immune to this. Fire-type attacks are boosted by 30%."ØRainstorm lowers attack damage by 15% and makes added effects half as likely. Water and Electric-type moves/Pok√©mon are immune to this.

There are items and abilities that make your Pok√©mon immune to these downsides regardless of type."Weather Areas"õCertain areas in the game experience intense weather. That weather will also be present in the battles of that area. Simple daily weather will not do this."Weather Synergies"¢Each weather has dozens of moves and abilities that benefit from that weather.

You can often use the Aid Kit instead to save on traveling time."Who goes first?"âIn battle, the Pok√©mon with the higher speed stat gets to use their move first. Some moves modify this. Speed ties are decided randomly."Attacking vs Status"~Attacking moves deal damage. Status moves do not. Status moves are notated by a Yin/Yang symbol (White and Black intermixing)."Physical vs Special"§Attacking moves are split into Physical moves, and Special moves. Each of these categories uses different stats to determine how much damage is dealt to the target."Physical Moves"•Physical moves are notated by the symbol of a smashing fist. Their damage is based on the Attack (Atk) stat of the attacker and the Defense (Def) stat of the target."Special Moves"´Special moves are notated by the symbol of a splash. Their damage is based on the Special Attack (Sp. Atk) of the attacker and the Special Defense (Sp. Def) of the target."Targeting"µMost moves target only a single Pok√©mon, but many can target multiple Pok√©mon at once. Some moves differ in how far they can target in the bigger battle styles (doubles, triples)."Move Types"£Every move has a type. Attacking moves deal different amounts of damage to different Pok√©mon based on those Pok√©mon's types. This is called 'type effectiveness'."Same-Type Bonus"öPok√©mon deal 50% more damage with moves the share a type with them. For example, a Raichu deals 50% more damage with an Electric move than a Normal move."Learning Moves"äPok√©mon learn new moves as they level up. They can also learn moves from the 'Move Tutors' who sit in the left side of every Pok√©Center."Base Power"èMoves with higher Base Power deal more damage. Some moves deal variable Base Power depending on the situation. Status moves have no base power."ñAccuracy is a move's chance of hitting. Most moves have 100% accuracy. Some effects can raise accuracy to let you use low-accuracy moves consistently."Power Points"äPower Points, or PP, is a number which limits how many times a move can be used. Healing at a Pok√©Center or with the Aid Kit restores PP."óEach Pok√©mon has type weakness and type resistances based on its own type. eg. Water deals double damage to Fire, and Fire deals half damage to Water."Type Combinations"±When a Pok√©mon has two types, its type weaknesses and resistances multiply. A Pok√©mon can be double weak or double resistant, or immune even though one of their types is weak."Normal Effective"SNormal Effective is the default effectiveness of all moves against a Pok√©mon."Super Effective"USuper Effective moves deal double the damage compared to normal effective moves."Hyper Effective"äHyper Effective moves deal quadruple the damage compared to normal effective moves. This happens when a Pok√©mon is double weak to a type."Not Very Effective"VNot Very Effective moves deal half the damage compared to normal effective moves."Barely Effective"íBarely Effective moves deal one quarter the damage compared to normal effective moves. This happens when a Pok√©mon is double resistant to a type."Ineffective"ØIneffective moves deal no damage at all. This can happen if one of a Pok√©mon's types has an immunity to the attacking move type, even if the other is neutral (or even weak!)."Looking Up Matchups"ëThe 5th and 6th pages of a MasterDex entry show that Pok√©mon's type matchups. Open the MasterDex in battle to check matchups if you're not sure."Psychic vs Steel"PPsychic is now Super-Effective vs Steel. Think of magicians bending spoons."Poison vs Water"RPoison is now Super-Effective vs Water. Think of chemicals polluting a river."Bug vs Fairy"LBug is now Super-Effective vs Fairy. Think of insects scaring children."Grass resistances"UGrass now resists Fairy, Psychic, and Ghost. Think of incense warding off magic."Ice resistances"iIce now resists Flying and Ground. Ice is Super-Effective against those types, so it's only natural!"Other changes"`Rock resists Ice. Fairy resists Dragon. Fairy is neutral against Fire. Bug resists Psychic."Why Get More?"ùHaving choices of Pok√©mon is important when facing challenges. A team of six is a bare minimum--it's best to catch more and pull them from the PC as needed."Methods of Aquiring"ãThe two main methods of acquiring Pok√©mon are catching them from the wild, and receiving them from other Trainers through gifts or trades."Catching Basics"ÆWild Pok√©mon will attack you if you walk through patches of grass, dark ground in caves, or other wild terrain. You can catch these Pok√©mon by throwing Pok√© Balls at them." Increase Catch Chance pt. 1"õCatching a Pok√©mon isn't guaranteed. It's easier to catch Pok√©mon when their health has been lowered by your attacks, or when they have a status ailment." Increase Catch Chance pt. 2"±Every time a Pok√©mon breaks out of a ball, it'll be slightly easier to catch for the rest of the battle. You can check what your current catch chance is in the Pok√© Ball menu."Finding Wild Pok√©mon"™Use the DexNav to get information on which Pok√©mon are available where you are. You can also use it to find more Pok√©mon of a species that you've already caught one of."Trades"éThroughout the world there will be people offering trades for Pok√©mon. Usually they want a different Pok√©mon, but sometimes they want money."What are Stats?"gStats, short for Statistics, are the numbers which determine how your Pok√©mon performs in battle."Checking Stats"äCheck your Pok√©mon's stats by looking at the second page of their summary screen, accessible through the Pok√©mon menu in the pause menu."Stat Factors"òYour Pok√©mon's stats are calculated from a combination of their species' 'Base Stats', their own 'Style Points', and extra modifications during battle."Base Stats"≠Every species of Pok√©mon have base stats, which affect every Pok√©mon of that species. e.g. Every Raichu will be fast because the Raichu species has a high Speed base stat."Style Points"îStyle Points are numbers which you can customize to change your Pok√©mon's stats. Style Points show as blue numbers on the stat page of the summary."Leveling and Evolution"ÖYour Pok√©mon's stats will increase every time they level up. When Pok√©mon evolve, their stats change (almost always they increase)."Accuracy and Evasion"êAccuracy and Evasion are two stats which are only active in battle, starting at 100% each. They are only modified by in-battle changing effects."Stat Steps"ìEffects can modify a Pok√©mon's stats during battle. These are called 'stat steps'. Stat steps multiply or divide the Pok√©mon's listed stat value."Bounds of Stat Steps"éStat steps start at 0, and can increase up to +12 (4x) and down to -12 (.25x). Stat steps are reset if you swap the Pok√©mon out or it faints."Checking Stat Steps"úYou can check the current stat steps of each Pok√©mon on the battlefield using the Info button. It lists the numerical step as well as resultant multiplier."What are abilities?"Abilities are special powers that Pok√©mon can have based on their species. Most Pok√©mon can have one of 2 possible abilities."Ability Effects"ãAbilities do a wide variety of different things. Understanding your team's abilities, and choosing the right ones, is important to winning."Checking Abilities"ãCheck your Pok√©mon's summary to see what ability they have. Use the MasterDex to read about the abilities of enemy Pok√©mon during battle."Choosing Abilities"êA Pok√©mon's ability is one of the two its species can have, randomly chosen when you get it. You can use Ability Capsules to swap to the other."Conditional Abilities"ÉMany abilities only do things under certain circumstances. Building around Weather and Room-synergy abilities is a common strategy."Effect Of Evolution"{A Pok√©mon's ability tends to stay the same when evolving, but can change. When this happens, the game will alert you."Defeating Abilities"ÉAn enemy Trainer's ability too much? Abilities like Neutralizing Gas, and moves like Gastro Acid, can suppress abilities in battle."Swapping Abilities"Moves like Skill Swap can be used to give a new ability to Pok√©mon during battle, enabling unique and creative team synergies."What are Held Items?"êHeld items are items which you can give your Pok√©mon to benefit them during battle. They can increase their damage, heal them, or other things."Equipping an item"ÜYou can give a Pok√©mon an item from your bag, or through the summary screen. Not all items do an effect when held, so read carefully."Berries"ÜBerries are a common held item. During battles, Pok√©mon will eat the berry to get a benefit. Get berries by picking from Berry Trees."Sitrus and Amwi Berry"£Sitrus Berry and Cado Berry are common berries which heal your Pok√©mon when at low health. If in doubt about what item to give a Pok√©mon, give them one of these."Rematerializer"~In Pok√©mon Tectonic, the Rematerializer regenerates held items which are consumed in battle. You'll never run out of berries!"Wild Held Items"hWild Pok√©mon can be found holding items. These items sometimes have held effects, but often don't."Getting More"ûYou will find more held items on the ground when traveling, or as gifts from people, or as the reward for defeating Avatars, or as purchasable items in shops." What are Status Conditions?"âStatus Conditions are ailments a Pok√©mon can have which hurt or restrict them. They remain after swapping out, and even between battles."Healing Status Conditions"`Status Conditions are removed when you heal at the Pok√©Center or when you use the Aid Kit."Status Immunity"áType immunities do not prevent status moves. However, some types give immunities to certain status conditions. Don't confuse these two!"çWhen burned, a Pok√©mon's Attack is reduced by 33%, and loses 1/8th HP every turn. Fire- and Ghost-types do the most burning. Fire is immune."Frostbite"ñWhen frostbitten, a Pok√©mon's Sp. Atk is reduced by 33%, and loses 1/8th HP every turn. Ice- and Flying-types do the most frostbiting. Ice is immune."ôWhen poisoned, a Pok√©mon loses 1/10th HP every turn. This doubles every 2 turns. Poison- and Grass-types do the most poisoning. Poison/Steel are immune."éWhen numbed, a Pok√©mon's Speed is halved, and it deals 25% less damage. Electric- and Fighting-types do the most numbing. Electric is immune."áWhen dizzied, a Pok√©mon takes 25% more attack damage, and its ability doesn't function. Psychic- and Fairy-types do the most dizzying."ñWhen leeched, a Pok√©mon loses 1/10th HP every turn, and its opponent(s) split that health. Bug- and Dark-types do the most leeching. Grass is immune."çA rarer status that causes a Pok√©mon to be unable to do anything for 2 turns. Psychic- and Grass-types put Pok√©mon to sleep the most often."What are Critical Hits?"zA critical hit deals 50% more damage than a regular hit. These naturally happen at random times on any damaging move.""How common are Critical Hits?"pThe base critical hit chance is 1 in 16. This chance can be raised by abilities, items, or special effects."Other Effects"ùCritical hits ignore stat steps (on the user or the target) that would lower their damage. They also ignore protective screens like Reflect and Light Screen."Preventing Criticals"üCertain abilities prevent critical hits against that Pokemon. The Lucky Chant effect and the Strategist tribe bonus also protect their side from critical hits."Guaranteed Criticals"ïSome moves or abilities are not random, but guarantee a critical hit under certain conditions. Otherwise, these act the same as random critical hits."}Avatars cannot perform random critical hits. However, they can perform guaranteed critical hits from moves or abilities."What are Tribes?"®Every Pok√©mon has 1-3 Tribes, decided by their species. Have 5 Pok√©mon of a shared Tribe on your team, and your entire team will receive that Tribe's bonus in battle!"Tribal Bonus"õTribal Bonuses are not identical: each Tribe provides a unique boon. With careful team composition, you can have 2 or even 3 Tribal Bonuses active at once!"Are they important?"îTribes are not required in any way to complete the game. They are simply an alternative team-building challenge to play with, like Single Type runs."What are Enemy Trainers?"îEnemy Trainers are the Pok√©mon Trainers you will battle throughout the game. Some block your path forwards (like Gym Leaders), others are optional."Detecting Trainers"îTrainers are people who have a companion Pok√©mon next to them. If a person doesn't have that, they either aren't a Trainer, or are an inactive one."Avoiding Trainers"üTrainers will challenge you if they see you within 4 tiles of them. Avoid them by going out of that distance, sneaking around them, or waiting until they move."Trainer Inactivity"≥When you defeat a Trainer, they will become inactive until the next time you heal at a Pok√©Center. This is indicated by them returning their companion Pok√©mon to its Pok√© Ball."Perfecting Fights"õIf you defeat a Trainer without any of your Pok√©mon fainting, you've 'perfected' the fight. They will leave forever and drop experience candy as a reward."Enemy Teams"õEnemy Trainers have their own teams of Pok√©mon with their own moves and held items. It's important to pay attention to these possibilities to win battles."Differences"ùThe typical trainer has 3 Pok√©mon, but Gym Leaders will have more. Trainers with more Pok√©mon also have more move variety and more items on their Pok√©mon."Pro Trainers"∞Pro Trainers are special Trainers, noted by their grey hair and black clothes. Their teams are always 6 Pok√©mon, all with items, and built around a Tribal Bonus. They're hard!"Trainer Behaviour"§Individual Trainers will always react to the same in-battle circumstances the same way. You can learn how to beat or even perfect a Trainer through trial and error."What are Avatars?"àAvatars are powerful enemy Pok√©mon with unique properties that you will fight and destroy during your adventure. They cannot be caught."Avatars are Healthy"rAvatars have two health bars, which means they have a lot of health. Much more than double the normal amount!"Multi-Move"}Avatars can move twice each turn. Their second move will happen after every battler has used their regular move for the turn."Two Statuses"{Avatars are large, and have room for up to two status conditions at a time. They can't have two of the same condition."HP-Based Effects"ÄEffects that damage based on a fraction of total HP are only one-sixth as powerful against avatars, compared to normal Pok√©mon."Primeval Moves"ùWhen a health bar is depleted, avatars will use a Primeval Move! Primeval Moves are powered-up versions of status moves, which also change the Avatar's type."Clean Slate"èBefore an Avatar uses a Primeval Move, they will also heal from any status conditions and reset any of their stat steps that have been lowered."Shields"çThe top of Avatars health bars starts Shielded. Shielded bars take 75% less damage. A shield is removed when the Avatar uses a Primeval Move."Attack Choice"|Avatars usually only have a few moves to choose from. They usually alternate between their moves on successive attacks."Target Choice"õA targeting reticle shows which of your battles the Avatar wants to attack. It will switch to another battler, however, if their attack is made impossible."Empowered Moves"âSome Avatars have Empowered attacks, which are powered-up versions of other attacks. They take up both of an Avatar's moves on that turn."Experience Reward"oWhen an Avatar is destroyed, every Pok√©mon on your team is given experience, even those that are fainted."Legendary Avatars"ìLegendary Avatars are unique. You fight them with 3 Pok√©mon, they have 3 HP bars, and they have more moves with more smarts about how to use them."What is the MasterDex?"^The MasterDex is an advanced encyclopedia about the 900+ Pok√©mon available in this game."Single MasterDex"ãAccess the MasterDex entry of a single Pok√©mon when looking at a Pok√©mon in the summary or the PC, or by using the Dex button in battles."Full MasterDex"óAccess the full MasterDex from your pause menu, or by pressing D when using the Dex button in battles (while it's waiting for you to select a battler)."Searching"úWhen in the MasterDex, you can press your Special keybind (default Shift or Z) to open the first search page.

You can often use the Aid Kit instead to save on traveling time."Who goes first?"âIn battle, the Pok√©mon with the higher speed stat gets to use their move first. Some moves modify this. Speed ties are decided randomly."Attacking vs Status"~Attacking moves deal damage. Status moves do not. Status moves are notated by a Yin/Yang symbol (White and Black intermixing)."Physical vs Special"§Attacking moves are split into Physical moves, and Special moves. Each of these categories uses different stats to determine how much damage is dealt to the target."Physical Moves"•Physical moves are notated by the symbol of a smashing fist. Their damage is based on the Attack (Atk) stat of the attacker and the Defense (Def) stat of the target."Special Moves"´Special moves are notated by the symbol of a splash. Their damage is based on the Special Attack (Sp. Atk) of the attacker and the Special Defense (Sp. Def) of the target."Targeting"µMost moves target only a single Pok√©mon, but many can target multiple Pok√©mon at once. Some moves differ in how far they can target in the bigger battle styles (doubles, triples)."Move Types"£Every move has a type. Attacking moves deal different amounts of damage to different Pok√©mon based on those Pok√©mon's types. This is called 'type effectiveness'."Same-Type Bonus"öPok√©mon deal 50% more damage with moves the share a type with them. For example, a Raichu deals 50% more damage with an Electric move than a Normal move."Learning Moves"äPok√©mon learn new moves as they level up. They can also learn moves from the 'Move Tutors' who sit in the left side of every Pok√©Center."Base Power"èMoves with higher Base Power deal more damage. Some moves deal variable Base Power depending on the situation. Status moves have no base power."ñAccuracy is a move's chance of hitting. Most moves have 100% accuracy. Some effects can raise accuracy to let you use low-accuracy moves consistently."Power Points"äPower Points, or PP, is a number which limits how many times a move can be used. Healing at a Pok√©Center or with the Aid Kit restores PP."óEach Pok√©mon has type weakness and type resistances based on its own type. eg. Water deals double damage to Fire, and Fire deals half damage to Water."Type Combinations"±When a Pok√©mon has two types, its type weaknesses and resistances multiply. A Pok√©mon can be double weak or double resistant, or immune even though one of their types is weak."Normal Effective"SNormal Effective is the default effectiveness of all moves against a Pok√©mon."Super Effective"USuper Effective moves deal double the damage compared to normal effective moves."Hyper Effective"äHyper Effective moves deal quadruple the damage compared to normal effective moves. This happens when a Pok√©mon is double weak to a type."Not Very Effective"VNot Very Effective moves deal half the damage compared to normal effective moves."Barely Effective"íBarely Effective moves deal one quarter the damage compared to normal effective moves. This happens when a Pok√©mon is double resistant to a type."Ineffective"ØIneffective moves deal no damage at all. This can happen if one of a Pok√©mon's types has an immunity to the attacking move type, even if the other is neutral (or even weak!)."Looking Up Matchups"ëThe 5th and 6th pages of a MasterDex entry show that Pok√©mon's type matchups. Open the MasterDex in battle to check matchups if you're not sure."Psychic vs Steel"PPsychic is now Super-Effective vs Steel. Think of magicians bending spoons."Poison vs Water"RPoison is now Super-Effective vs Water. Think of chemicals polluting a river."Bug vs Fairy"LBug is now Super-Effective vs Fairy. Think of insects scaring children."Grass resistances"UGrass now resists Fairy, Psychic, and Ghost. Think of incense warding off magic."Ice resistances"iIce now resists Flying and Ground. Ice is Super-Effective against those types, so it's only natural!"Other changes"`Rock resists Ice. Fairy resists Dragon. Fairy is neutral against Fire. Bug resists Psychic."Why Get More?"ùHaving choices of Pok√©mon is important when facing challenges. A team of six is a bare minimum--it's best to catch more and pull them from the PC as needed."Methods of Aquiring"ãThe two main methods of acquiring Pok√©mon are catching them from the wild, and receiving them from other Trainers through gifts or trades."Catching Basics"ÆWild Pok√©mon will attack you if you walk through patches of grass, dark ground in caves, or other wild terrain. You can catch these Pok√©mon by throwing Pok√© Balls at them." Increase Catch Chance pt. 1"õCatching a Pok√©mon isn't guaranteed. It's easier to catch Pok√©mon when their health has been lowered by your attacks, or when they have a status ailment." Increase Catch Chance pt. 2"±Every time a Pok√©mon breaks out of a ball, it'll be slightly easier to catch for the rest of the battle. You can check what your current catch chance is in the Pok√© Ball menu."Finding Wild Pok√©mon"™Use the DexNav to get information on which Pok√©mon are available where you are. You can also use it to find more Pok√©mon of a species that you've already caught one of."Trades"éThroughout the world there will be people offering trades for Pok√©mon. Usually they want a different Pok√©mon, but sometimes they want money."What are Stats?"gStats, short for Statistics, are the numbers which determine how your Pok√©mon performs in battle."Checking Stats"äCheck your Pok√©mon's stats by looking at the second page of their summary screen, accessible through the Pok√©mon menu in the pause menu."Stat Factors"òYour Pok√©mon's stats are calculated from a combination of their species' 'Base Stats', their own 'Style Points', and extra modifications during battle."Base Stats"≠Every species of Pok√©mon have base stats, which affect every Pok√©mon of that species. e.g. Every Raichu will be fast because the Raichu species has a high Speed base stat."Style Points"îStyle Points are numbers which you can customize to change your Pok√©mon's stats. Style Points show as blue numbers on the stat page of the summary."Leveling and Evolution"ÖYour Pok√©mon's stats will increase every time they level up. When Pok√©mon evolve, their stats change (almost always they increase)."Accuracy and Evasion"êAccuracy and Evasion are two stats which are only active in battle, starting at 100% each. They are only modified by in-battle changing effects."Stat Steps"ìEffects can modify a Pok√©mon's stats during battle. These are called 'stat steps'. Stat steps multiply or divide the Pok√©mon's listed stat value."Bounds of Stat Steps"éStat steps start at 0, and can increase up to +12 (4x) and down to -12 (.25x). Stat steps are reset if you swap the Pok√©mon out or it faints."Checking Stat Steps"úYou can check the current stat steps of each Pok√©mon on the battlefield using the Info button. It lists the numerical step as well as resultant multiplier."What are abilities?"Abilities are special powers that Pok√©mon can have based on their species. Most Pok√©mon can have one of 2 possible abilities."Ability Effects"ãAbilities do a wide variety of different things. Understanding your team's abilities, and choosing the right ones, is important to winning."Checking Abilities"ãCheck your Pok√©mon's summary to see what ability they have. Use the MasterDex to read about the abilities of enemy Pok√©mon during battle."Choosing Abilities"êA Pok√©mon's ability is one of the two its species can have, randomly chosen when you get it. You can use Ability Capsules to swap to the other."Conditional Abilities"ÉMany abilities only do things under certain circumstances. Building around Weather and Room-synergy abilities is a common strategy."Effect Of Evolution"{A Pok√©mon's ability tends to stay the same when evolving, but can change. When this happens, the game will alert you."Defeating Abilities"ÉAn enemy Trainer's ability too much? Abilities like Neutralizing Gas, and moves like Gastro Acid, can suppress abilities in battle."Swapping Abilities"Moves like Skill Swap can be used to give a new ability to Pok√©mon during battle, enabling unique and creative team synergies."What are Held Items?"êHeld items are items which you can give your Pok√©mon to benefit them during battle. They can increase their damage, heal them, or other things."Equipping an item"ÜYou can give a Pok√©mon an item from your bag, or through the summary screen. Not all items do an effect when held, so read carefully."Berries"ÜBerries are a common held item. During battles, Pok√©mon will eat the berry to get a benefit. Get berries by picking from Berry Trees."Sitrus and Amwi Berry"£Sitrus Berry and Cado Berry are common berries which heal your Pok√©mon when at low health. If in doubt about what item to give a Pok√©mon, give them one of these."Rematerializer"~In Pok√©mon Tectonic, the Rematerializer regenerates held items which are consumed in battle. You'll never run out of berries!"Wild Held Items"hWild Pok√©mon can be found holding items. These items sometimes have held effects, but often don't."Getting More"ûYou will find more held items on the ground when traveling, or as gifts from people, or as the reward for defeating Avatars, or as purchasable items in shops." What are Status Conditions?"âStatus Conditions are ailments a Pok√©mon can have which hurt or restrict them. They remain after swapping out, and even between battles."Healing Status Conditions"`Status Conditions are removed when you heal at the Pok√©Center or when you use the Aid Kit."Status Immunity"áType immunities do not prevent status moves. However, some types give immunities to certain status conditions. Don't confuse these two!"çWhen burned, a Pok√©mon's Attack is reduced by 33%, and loses 1/8th HP every turn. Fire- and Ghost-types do the most burning. Fire is immune."Frostbite"ñWhen frostbitten, a Pok√©mon's Sp. Atk is reduced by 33%, and loses 1/8th HP every turn. Ice- and Flying-types do the most frostbiting. Ice is immune."ôWhen poisoned, a Pok√©mon loses 1/10th HP every turn. This doubles every 2 turns. Poison- and Grass-types do the most poisoning. Poison/Steel are immune."éWhen numbed, a Pok√©mon's Speed is halved, and it deals 25% less damage. Electric- and Fighting-types do the most numbing. Electric is immune."áWhen dizzied, a Pok√©mon takes 25% more attack damage, and its ability doesn't function. Psychic- and Fairy-types do the most dizzying."ñWhen leeched, a Pok√©mon loses 1/10th HP every turn, and its opponent(s) split that health. Bug- and Dark-types do the most leeching. Grass is immune."çA rarer status that causes a Pok√©mon to be unable to do anything for 2 turns. Psychic- and Grass-types put Pok√©mon to sleep the most often."What are Critical Hits?"zA critical hit deals 50% more damage than a regular hit. These naturally happen at random times on any damaging move.""How common are Critical Hits?"pThe base critical hit chance is 1 in 16. This chance can be raised by abilities, items, or special effects."Other Effects"ùCritical hits ignore stat steps (on the user or the target) that would lower their damage. They also ignore protective screens like Reflect and Light Screen."Preventing Criticals"üCertain abilities prevent critical hits against that Pokemon. The Lucky Chant effect and the Strategist tribe bonus also protect their side from critical hits."Guaranteed Criticals"ïSome moves or abilities are not random, but guarantee a critical hit under certain conditions. Otherwise, these act the same as random critical hits."}Avatars cannot perform random critical hits. However, they can perform guaranteed critical hits from moves or abilities."What are Tribes?"®Every Pok√©mon has 1-3 Tribes, decided by their species. Have 5 Pok√©mon of a shared Tribe on your team, and your entire team will receive that Tribe's bonus in battle!"Tribal Bonus"õTribal Bonuses are not identical: each Tribe provides a unique boon. With careful team composition, you can have 2 or even 3 Tribal Bonuses active at once!"Are they important?"îTribes are not required in any way to complete the game. They are simply an alternative team-building challenge to play with, like Single Type runs."What are Enemy Trainers?"îEnemy Trainers are the Pok√©mon Trainers you will battle throughout the game. Some block your path forwards (like Gym Leaders), others are optional."Detecting Trainers"îTrainers are people who have a companion Pok√©mon next to them. If a person doesn't have that, they either aren't a Trainer, or are an inactive one."Avoiding Trainers"üTrainers will challenge you if they see you within 4 tiles of them. Avoid them by going out of that distance, sneaking around them, or waiting until they move."Trainer Inactivity"≥When you defeat a Trainer, they will become inactive until the next time you heal at a Pok√©Center. This is indicated by them returning their companion Pok√©mon to its Pok√© Ball."Perfecting Fights"õIf you defeat a Trainer without any of your Pok√©mon fainting, you've 'perfected' the fight. They will leave forever and drop experience candy as a reward."Enemy Teams"õEnemy Trainers have their own teams of Pok√©mon with their own moves and held items. It's important to pay attention to these possibilities to win battles."Differences"ùThe typical trainer has 3 Pok√©mon, but Gym Leaders will have more. Trainers with more Pok√©mon also have more move variety and more items on their Pok√©mon."Pro Trainers"∞Pro Trainers are special Trainers, noted by their grey hair and black clothes. Their teams are always 6 Pok√©mon, all with items, and built around a Tribal Bonus. They're hard!"Trainer Behaviour"§Individual Trainers will always react to the same in-battle circumstances the same way. You can learn how to beat or even perfect a Trainer through trial and error."What are Avatars?"àAvatars are powerful enemy Pok√©mon with unique properties that you will fight and destroy during your adventure. They cannot be caught."Avatars are Healthy"rAvatars have two health bars, which means they have a lot of health. Much more than double the normal amount!"Multi-Move"}Avatars can move twice each turn. Their second move will happen after every battler has used their regular move for the turn."Two Statuses"{Avatars are large, and have room for up to two status conditions at a time. They can't have two of the same condition."HP-Based Effects"ÄEffects that damage based on a fraction of total HP are only one-sixth as powerful against avatars, compared to normal Pok√©mon."Primeval Moves"ùWhen a health bar is depleted, avatars will use a Primeval Move! Primeval Moves are powered-up versions of status moves, which also change the Avatar's type."Clean Slate"èBefore an Avatar uses a Primeval Move, they will also heal from any status conditions and reset any of their stat steps that have been lowered."Shields"çThe top of Avatars health bars starts Shielded. Shielded bars take 75% less damage. A shield is removed when the Avatar uses a Primeval Move."Attack Choice"|Avatars usually only have a few moves to choose from. They usually alternate between their moves on successive attacks."Target Choice"õA targeting reticle shows which of your battles the Avatar wants to attack. It will switch to another battler, however, if their attack is made impossible."Empowered Moves"âSome Avatars have Empowered attacks, which are powered-up versions of other attacks. They take up both of an Avatar's moves on that turn."Experience Reward"oWhen an Avatar is destroyed, every Pok√©mon on your team is given experience, even those that are fainted."Legendary Avatars"ìLegendary Avatars are unique. You fight them with 3 Pok√©mon, they have 3 HP bars, and they have more moves with more smarts about how to use them."What is the MasterDex?"^The MasterDex is an advanced encyclopedia about the 900+ Pok√©mon available in this game."Single MasterDex"ãAccess the MasterDex entry of a single Pok√©mon when looking at a Pok√©mon in the summary or the PC, or by using the Dex button in battles."Full MasterDex"óAccess the full MasterDex from your pause menu, or by pressing D when using the Dex button in battles (while it's waiting for you to select a battler)."Searching"úWhen in the MasterDex, you can press your Special keybind (default Shift or Z) to open the first search page.
