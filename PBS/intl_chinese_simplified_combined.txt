即时新闻！
I'm live here at <imp>Tri Island</imp>, a mysterious island discovered recently off the coast of Makya.
最近在马凯亚附近的海域，发现了一座新的岛屿，我现在就在这座<imp>三相岛</imp>。
Trainers from all over the world are making their way over as there have been sightings of extremely rare Pokemon and resources.
因为这里发现了极其罕见的精灵，目前世界各地都有训练师向此地进发。
With no region claiming major jurisdiction over the island, there have been reports of multiple factions creating base camps in the area.
由于目前没有任何1个地区，对此岛屿宣称了主权，因此很多派别都于岛上建立了营地。
The only thing that's certain here is the battling as Trainers duke it out over territory and access to these new wild areas.
我们目前唯一可以确定的是，这里的训练师们会为了争夺领地，进入这片新世界而展开战斗。
But for now, we'll be providing live coverage of the event. Over and out.
这次的报道到此结束，谢谢大家的收看。
Uh -- yes? Did you want to ask me something?
啊...那个，你想问我什么吗？
Well then don't -- can you not -- I'm not a big fan of being stared at.
那你...能不能...不要这样...一直盯着我看？我...不喜欢这样。
I just like... I’m a wanderer. Or, rather, not a wanderer -- but I don't have a home -- or, well -- excuse me. I spend most of my time in caves.
我只是喜欢...我...是个流浪者。或者说...不是流浪...只是...我没有家...我...抱歉，大部分时间...我都待在山洞里。
I don't know? I mean -- no, I know, but rather I'm not sure why -- I mean, what kind of question is that? I'm a Pokémon trainer.
我不知道...不是，我是说...我知道...但是我不确定...不对，这是个什么问题？我是个精灵训练师。
Or I was. And I’m... rather good at it. And not much else.
或者说以前是...并且我...擅长这个。并且...其他方面不行。
A friend's. Just a friend's. I'm good at -- they entrust me with the training. I get results.
1个朋友的，只是朋友...我...擅长...所以他们...委托我帮忙训练...我...有成绩。
I mean, that sounds -- that's not what I really meant. I'm -- I'm -- I was -- let's move on.
我是说，这...不是我的想法...我...我...我...继续前进吧。
Heyo, \PN. Hear you’ve been busy.
喂，\PN，听说你很忙。
You’re just racking up badges like they’re nothing, huh? Mavis must be so proud.
你不会徽章都能堆成小山了吧？哈，梅维斯肯定会为你骄傲的。
It’s not a compliment. Just stating the facts.
这不是恭维，陈述事实而已。
And the fact is that you’re not getting anywhere now unless you come meet me, for reasons that make me too angry to explain.
但现在的情况是，你得来见我，不然你哪儿也去不了，至于原因，让我气得解释不了。
I’ve got a <imp>gift</imp> for you.
我会给你带一份<imp>礼物</imp>。
I’m literally friends with two - I mean ONE - of those gym leaders, and I was the commanding officer for half the people keeping track of Rafael.
我跟其中2个...或者说1个道馆馆主是朋友关系，刚想到的另1个朋友，是拉斐尔身边的护林员队长。
Word gets around.
所以消息来得很快。
I also know that you’re gonna have some issues getting <imp>across that river</imp> without my help.
而且我清楚，如果没有我的帮助，你没有可以<imp>过河</imp>的方法。
Yikes.
啊。
Yeah, Mavis is… Mavis.
也对，梅维斯...是那个梅维斯。
You know, you… ah, nevermind. Eye on the prize and all that.
你知道你...啊，算了，总之你应该想要奖品吧。
Speaking of which, you need to get <imp>across the river</imp>, yeah?
你现在是不是在为<imp>过河</imp>的事发愁？
We might be able to reach an arrangement...
或许你可以试试完成我的安排...
But. But... you know how this works.
不过...我得先说清楚需要做什么。
Quid pro quo, yeah? I know you’ve scratched a few avatars off of my hit list.
这算是交换条件？我知道你已经帮我把几个化身，从我的“追杀名单”上划掉了。
Gonna be clear as crystal here: you’re doing better than most of the rangers.
这让我不得不说一句：你比大部分护林员做得更好。
Such as the ones that recently just got mauled by a particularly ornery <imp>Titanix avatar</imp>.
比如最近被1个特别暴躁的<imp>泰坦蛇化身</imp>攻击的那些人。
You know me so well. Put the thing in the ground – well, more in the ground.
你看来很懂我啊，把那个东西塞进地底...最好是塞进地心！
It’s ripping through the mine yard in <imp>Grouz</imp> at the moment, which is… a problem.
它现在正在<imp>古治镇</imp>的矿场里肆虐，这是个绝对的大麻烦。
If it goes down particular routes we could be facing a VERY uncomfortable situation.
如果它继续这样闹下去，我们会陷入非常糟糕的局面。
The rangers? Dealing with rampaging Tauros and crossroads hauntings.
你说护林员？处理狂奔的肯泰罗和十字路口的幽灵。
Avatars are out of their paygrade. Not that we don’t send them in anyways and hope for the best.
化身并不属于他们的工作范畴，当然也不是说完全不管，只是他们并不擅长做这些。
Speaking of which: <imp>Grouz</imp>. Squad went out and didn’t leave a scratch on the damn thing.
说到这里：<imp>古治镇</imp>那边，护林员小队也跟化身打了，但连一点划痕都没能造成。
You can split it right open, though, yeah?
你应该能解决掉它吧？
You don’t know what busy looks like, kid. You think I’m not trying to work here?
你知道真正的忙碌是什么吗？孩子，要不我们换换工作？
I know you cut a deal with Helena. Same here: you accelerate my timetable, I do the same for you.
我知道你跟海伦娜达成了协议，我这边也一样，你帮我，我也会帮你加快进度。
So make your way down to <imp>Grouz</imp> and turn that Titanix to slag. Please?
所以你能去<imp>古治镇</imp>把那个泰坦蛇解决掉吗？求你了？
I’ll check back in on you when I hear that behemoth’s gone. Promise I’ll make it worth your while, too.
等我听到任务完成的消息后，我会来找你的，必不会让你白白打工。
Capisce? Good. Bye.
没问题了吧？那就拜拜。
…She hung up.
...她挂断了。
Before you can put your phone away, it starts ringing again.
你还没来得及收起手机，铃声又响了起来。
It seems like an important call.
看起来是个很重要的电话。
\PN, I need your help. It’s urgent.
\PN，我需要你的帮助，紧急！
You know the <imp>catacombs</imp> under Prizca?
你知道宏礼市的<imp>地下墓穴</imp>吗？
There’s an entrance in the <imp>sewers</imp>. I need you here, now.
你可以通过<imp>下水道</imp>的入口进来，我在这里等你，快点！
I’ll explain when you get here – this isn’t the most secure way to communicate.
等你到了之后我再解释...电话通信算不上安全。
It’s bad, though. Real bad. I need a trainer of your caliber.
情况非常糟糕，非常非常糟糕！我需要你这样的训练师。
Thanks. I know this is sudden, but I can’t overstate how much I need your help ASAP.
谢谢，我知道很突然，但这边说成多么紧急都不过分。
Listen, kid, if I could call in a couple Chasm strike teams, I would.
听着，孩子，如果我能指望护林员，早叫他们了。
But things change, and now all I have is you. You are NOT going to like the consequences if you don’t help me.
但是世事难料，现在只有你你，如果你不来，这个后果，我相信你也不会喜欢的。
Please.
拜托了。
Bring the best team you’ve got. It’s gonna get ugly.
带上你最强的精灵，这不是能简单应付的。
Hey, just checking in. What’s going on? Making progress?
嘿，日常检查，情况怎样？你不会一直没进展吧？
Oh, wow. Really trying your li’l heart out, aren’t you? More than one gym!
好家伙，你真是拼命了啊！打了不止1个道馆！
Ah, don’t get all broken up about it.
哈哈，别在意这种事。
You could be in the big city with six badges under your belt and it wouldn’t matter.
只要到了大城市这边，就能拿到6个徽章了。
Why, I never.
为什么？随便你。
Haven’t you heard blood’s thicker than water?
没听说过血浓于水吗？
Practically a type advantage.
这就是一种属性优势。
Well, whatever -- keep your secrets.
不过，随便你吧，保护好你的小秘密。
As for me, I’m taking a break before facing Noel.
至于我，打算在面对诺埃尔前，稍微休息一段时间。
You don’t know him -- and, let’s be honest, you probably never will -- but he’s kind of a big deal.
哦，你可能不知道他是谁...当然你可能永远都不会认识他，那可是个大人物。
So while you’re scuttling to and fro like a Falinks without an officer, I’ll be relaxing.
所以，当你什么时候，像个没有头头的列阵兵一样，四处瞎转悠的时候，我就可以放松一下咯。
Wish you were here!
真希望你就在这里啊！
He hung up…
他挂断了...
Wow, that was… a complete breeze.
哇，真是...轻而易举啊。
A joke, honestly.
当然，只是随便说说。
That’s my sixth badge now. You?
这是我的第6个徽章了，你呢？
Wow. I remember that.
哦，我记得那个。
Wait, how did you even schedule a challenge?
等下，你怎么预约到挑战的？
I made an appointment before I got on the ship.
我当时在船上的时候就预约了。
You... you're serious about this, aren't you?
你...你没糊弄我，对吧？
That can’t be right.
这不可能。
You’re better than that.
你肯定比这强。
Not by much, but if you’re lying, then… you’re taking this seriously. Huh.
你不可能菜成这样，不过，既然你在撒谎，也就是...你对这场竞争很认真嘛。
Hah! That never gets old.
哈，我猜也是这种回应。
You remind me of… I guess a Zangoose, right? So angry, but so normal.
你又让我想起了...那个猫鼬斩对吧？火气大得很，当然不是一般属性那个。
But you are really angry, aren’t you?
但你火气真的很大不是吗？
Well, you’ve certainly made good time, but this is where things start getting harder.
哈哈，反正你的确赶上好时候了，现在，情况会变得越来越难。
You’ve still got a lot of ground to cover.
你还有很多事情要做。
See you at the championship!
锦标赛上见！
I’ll make sure to look in the stands for you.
我一定会帮你留意看台位置的。
He hung up… again.
他又挂了...
Hey, \PN. Things going well on your front?
喂，\PN。你那边进展如何？
Good. You’ve got eight badges now, right?
很好，你现在有8个徽章了对吧？
That’s... it’s something. You’ll excuse me if I’m not too preoccupied with the whole gym challenge shebang.
我这边可不像道馆挑战...已经忙得焦头烂额了。
That makes one of us.
那，我们就一样了。
Between the avatars and... recent developments... I’ve been swamped.
加在化身和...近期的事之间，我可是一直忙得不可开交。
Yeah, frickin’ tell me about it. I know exactly what you’re talking about, too.
是啊，我想你也知道是怎么回事。
Listen: I know the stress is probably getting to you, but we’re in the endgame now.
我知道你可能也很有压力，但我们已经快到尾声了。
Be a hero, become Champion, go home to Mavis. Everyone’s happy, right? Smiles all round.
成为英雄，成为冠军，回到梅维斯身边，让大家都开心地笑起来。
So, yeah, just a li’l bit longer.
所以...再成长一点就好了。
Take down those avatars if you can spare the time, come back to Prizca for the Championship, and... we’ll see about Yezera.
如果你能抽出时间，就去多解决几个化身吧，然后回宏礼市参加锦标赛，然后...再去处理叶泽拉的问题。
Thanks, \PN. I know it’s a lot.
谢了\PN，我知道事很多。
Thanks.
谢谢。
Whoever the hell it is helping Yezera, they’ve been making the rounds.
无论是谁在帮叶泽拉，他们一直在四处活动。
Good news is that you seem to be their priority. Haven’t been, y’know, rampaging. Which is good.
好消息是，你是他们的首要目标，这样你可以顺路解决一些问题。
I’ve had zero luck trying to track them down. I’d hire Alessa again if she’d return my calls – but, hey, that’s why I have you, right?
我不知道他们在什么地方。如果阿莱莎能再接电话的话，我还会再雇她做些什么...或许这就是我找上你的原因？
Yes and no. You’re gonna have to cut through some of the best trainers in the region, but it ain’t just busywork this time.
是，也不是，你得从本地区的训练师中拔得头筹，但这次不只是工作而已。
Not that it ever is – thanks, by the way – but this one should be especially interesting for you.
顺便说一句，谢谢...不过这次你会特别感兴趣的。
That’s what I like to hear. This ain’t gonna be an easy operation, but I trust in your abilities.
我就喜欢听你这么说，这次行动不会轻松，但我相信你的能力。
Mostly in committing violence. Lots of violence. Though, actually, maybe try talking this one out?
主要是得用暴力解决...1次接着1次地用暴力解决。当然，如果能说服他们最好不是吗？
You’re gonna want to hear this one. Trust me.
我觉得你想听我接下来的话。
I mean, you’ve got a minute before the Championship anyways. This op is... it’s pretty dire, importance- wise.
我的意思是说，反正你离冠军就差最后一步了，这次行动...重要性非常高。
I’ve got a confirmed sighting on Yezera. She’s back in her hometown – <imp>Whitebloom</imp>.
我确定看到叶泽拉回家了，我是说她老家 – <imp>白花镇</imp>.。
Yezera’s got a few titans on her and some kind of master plan, so she’s your first priority.
她身边还带着几个巨人，看起来有某种计划，再加上你是她的首要目标。
\PN... thanks in advance. Try and be understanding with Yezera. She’s... dealt with a lot.
\PN...我会提前向你表示感谢，试着去理解叶泽拉吧，她...承受了太多了。
But do what you have to do.
不过，按你自身的方式行动就好。
Do what you have to do, come back to Prizca for the tournament, and go home a Champion.
然后就做你该做的事情，来宏礼市参加锦标赛，再以冠军的身份回家。
Happy endings all-round, right?
皆大欢喜，对吧？
Right. Bye.
就这样了，拜。
Hey-o! Been a lil' bit but I managed to pry your number from Zain.
喂！很久不见了啊，不过我从赞恩那里要到了你的电话。
Sucks that I couldn't face you in the Tournament, but I've got a surprise to make up for it!
很遗憾没能在锦标赛上与你对决，但我这里有个惊喜可以弥补。
Heard about this place called the <imp>Battle Monument</imp>.
听说有个叫<imp>对战纪念碑</imp>的地方。
The whole idea is that you can fight through a gauntlet of AI trainers. Neat, right?
核心玩法是让你挑战一连串AI训练师。挺酷的，对吧？
They're weird about directly inviting people, but you're a champion so you should just waltz right in. It'll be fine.
他们邀请的人都是一些高手，而且你是冠军，所以可以大摇大摆地进去。
I'll send the GPS coordinates to you so you can sail on over and give it a looksie.
我会把GPS坐标发给你，这样你就能开船去看看了。
Oh yeah, guess I didn't say before, but the Battle Monument is a big tower in the middle of the ocean.
哦，对了，我之前没说，对战纪念碑是海中央的一座高塔。
If I didn't know better, I'd think it was some evil villainous lair.
如果不是事先了解的话，我会误以为那里是什么邪恶巢穴。
Anyways, I'll be hanging around the Battle Monument for the foreseeable future, so meet me here, ya hear?
总之，我接下来会一直待在<imp>对战纪念碑</imp>附近，记得来找我，听到了吗？
I've got some new team configurations I really wanna try against you.
我组了些新队伍配置，真想找你试试看。
...
...
...Ok yeah someone here just asked to battle me, and I'm not gonna turn that down, so I gotta end the call now.
...呃...有人来跟我对战了，我不可能拒绝这个机会，所以我要挂断了。
Hope you're doing well, be safe, make good choices, have fun, et cetera. Bye bye!
希望你们一切顺利，注意安全，然后做出正确的选择，并玩得开心。再见咯！
…They hung up.
...挂断了。
They must really want to talk with you.
他们一定想和你谈谈。
A couple seconds later, you receive a text message with the coordinates to the Battle Monument.
几秒钟后，你收到了短信，上面有对战纪念碑的坐标。
Hello to you, young one.
你好啊，年轻人。
It is I, Dr. Hekata.
我是赫卡塔博士。
Do not worry about how I learned of your cellphone number. I simply divined it.
我怎么知道你手机号码的？别担心，只是猜到了而已。
I have a topic to discuss of some importance.
我只是有件事要跟你说。
I beseech you—<imp>visit my abode in Grouz</imp>. There we shall discuss.
就当是我的恳求了...<imp>来我在古治镇的住所</imp>面谈吧。
Apologies for the interruption to your adventure, young master.
抱歉打断你的冒险之旅，少主。
However, given that you've sent a number of Pokemon to Storage, I thought it best that I inform you of my project.
由于您寄送了很多的精灵，我觉得还是要跟您说一下我的计划。
To make it short: Your family owns an unused Estate here in Makya.
让我们长话短说 - 您名下有一处在马凯亚的庄园。
Since you're taking on the Makyan Gym Challenge, I took the initiative to renovate the grounds for our use.
由于之前一直处于弃置状态，所以我在听说您要来这边进行道馆挑战之后，便自作主张将其修缮了一番。
I've set up a system that sends the Pokemon you store in your PC to this <imp>PokÉstate</imp>.
这是我所写的1个程序系统，您可以将存储在电脑中的精灵送到这座<imp>庄园</imp>里休憩。
I'll take care of them there while you are busy with your journey.
当您忙于旅途时，我会在那里好好照看它们。
I love Pokemon variety, so I've prepared lots of <imp>EXP Candy</imp> to give you as your collection grows.
随着庄园里的精灵种类越来越多，我也可以给您提供一些<imp>经验糖果</imp>，帮助您完成这次的旅程。
Once you've earned some, I'll send them to you through the PC.
我会将它们寄存在电脑中，您可以随时取用。
I'll continue to wait for you on the boat. If you want to visit the PokÉstate, send me a ping at any PC.
我会继续在船上等您，如果您想要前往庄园，只需要用电脑发消息给我就好。
I'll take you there immediately.
我会立即带您前往那里。
That is all. I will distract you no further, young master.
大概就这样了，最后再次致歉，抱歉打断了您的旅程，少主，祝您接下来一切都顺利。
\i[TAROTAMULET]The Tarot Amulet spasms like something dying.
\i[塔罗护符]这个塔罗护符就像1个病入膏肓的人一样在痉挛着...
You feel your pupils dilate and somewhere bleak and broken almost comes into view at the corners of your vision.
你的瞳孔逐渐放大，视野中出现了1个荒凉破败的地方。
A woman’s voice whispers from that place – almost familiar, but not quite.
1个女人正在那里喃喃自语...那声音即熟悉，又感到陌生。
You shouldn’t have reversed that amulet, dearest.
你不该把护身符反过来的，亲爱的。
The woman who gave it to you was trying to protect you.
把它给你的女人是想保护你。
Now, though, charms for safe beginnings turn to invitations of dire endings.
但现在，安全旅程的魅力，变成了可怕结局的邀约。
Maybe there’s something to learn from interlacing your journey with the path of ordeals, though.
不过，将你的旅程与磨难交织在一起，或许还能学到更多的东西。
Enjoy this brief, bitter taste of the end, darling, and I’ll try and pull some strings should you prove victorious.
享受这短暂而苦涩的结局吧，如果你赢了，亲爱的，我会想办法帮助你的。
\i[TAROTAMULET]Once again the amulet twitches.
\i[塔罗护符]护符再次抽搐起来。
Once again, you can almost make something out, just past your peripheral vision.
你又1次在视野之外，仿佛看到了什么东西。
Once again, she speaks.
是她，她又说话了。
Oh? You’re back, dearest. Lovely.
亲爱的，你回来了，真可爱。
These people are tied inextricably to this region’s secrets; its conspiracies.
这些人与这个地区的秘密和阴谋密不可分。
Let me implant a bit of my demesne into theirs, and I might be able to tease them open like a faulty lock.
让我把自身的领地植入其中，或许能像打开一把坏锁一样，将一切变得透亮。
You want to know more, don’t you? Want them to trust you?
你也想知道更多对吧？你希望他们能信任你？
Then prepare to enjoy another trial.
那就准备享受另一场审判吧。
\i[TAROTAMULET]It’s the amulet again.
\i[塔罗护符]又是护身符。
It isn’t the thing itself that’s in pain. No, something else is – something larger.
痛苦的不是事物本身，是别的...更大的东西。
Something is wrong in this region.
这个地区出问题了。
Another challenge, another opportunity.
又1个挑战，又1个机遇。
I never put much stock into mysticism until my hand was forced. I’m so glad to see my investment paying dividends.
在我被逼无奈之前，从来不相信所为的神秘主义，但现在很高兴看到，自身的投资得到了回报。
These people don’t even know I’m threading their fate through yours!
这些人甚至都不知道，我把他们的命运，与你的命运紧紧连在一起了！
I paint an impressed expression on their malleable faces – so long as you can walk the walk.
我在他们那可塑性很强的脸上，画上了印象深刻的表情...当然，只有你能做到。
Go on, dearest. You know the rules by now.
去吧，亲爱的，你现在已经知道规矩了。
\i[TAROTAMULET]The reversed amulet spasms and the other place impends on you.
\i[塔罗护符]护符再次痉挛，又有1个地方逼近你了。
That voice… it’s painfully familiar.
那声音...熟悉地令人心痛。
Oh, you already know who I am, child.
哦，你已经知道我是谁了，孩子。
I’m the one that’s waiting for you at the end of the line. The end of your line… and of every line.
我就是那个在终点等你的人...即是你的终点，也是整条线路的终点。
Makya is a place rich in history.
马凯亚是个历史悠久的地方。
That’s why you endure these tastes of my demesne, isn’t it? To learn history?
你在学习这里的历史吗？这就是你忍受我的原因对吧？
Well, even history ends. You’ll understand eventually.
好吧，即便历史就此终结，你也能最终明白。
Go on. Show me what a conqueror you are, darling.
继续吧，亲爱的，让我看看你是个怎样的征服者。
\i[TAROTAMULET]At this point, you can almost hear fate whimpering through the amulet.
\i[塔罗护符]此时此刻，你几乎可以通过护身符，听到命运的呜咽。
Her voice shushes it, but does not comfort it.
她在安慰它，却没有安慰的语调。
Where did Imogene get this thing? I doubt she realized the significance of the sliver of stone she implanted within this amulet.
伊莫珍是从哪儿弄到它的？我猜她根本没有理解，在这里面植入那块石头的意义。
It was uplifted from a forbidden place where history is tortuous and frayed.
那时从历史曲折的禁地中升起的。
Its latent power, the witch’s arcana, and, of course, my… expertise… all aligned to make my little bits of influence possible.
潜藏着力量、奥术，当然还有我自身的专长...所有这些结合起来后，让我的影响力一点点变成可能。
I hope you feel lucky, darling: you are.
我希望你能意识到自身的幸运，亲爱的。
Always.
你永远都是幸运的。
\i[TAROTAMULET].....
\i[塔罗护符].....
There’s something calming about the hellscape you can almost perceive.
你几乎可以感知到地狱般的景象。
It’s a calm hell; quiet and somber.
那时1个平静、沉寂的地狱。
Her voice is much the same.
她的声音也是如此。
If only I could twist these gym leaders’ roles without having to suffuse their arenas with my demesne and all its… antipathy.
如果我可以改变这些道馆馆主，让他们的道馆不至于充满我的领地...那该有多好。
History ends quietly, but not kindly.
历史的结局是平静的，但并不美好。
Here, our day-to-day lives are much like what you endure in these battles.
在这里，我们的日常生活，就像你们在战斗中经历的一样。
Oh, don’t pity me. My only point is that I would gladly spare you the intensity of fate’s dying gasps if I could, trust me.
哦，不用可怜我，我唯一想说的就是，如果可以，我很乐意让你，免受命运临终前的剧烈喘息。
Trust me, darling.
相信我，亲爱的。
\i[TAROTAMULET]As the amulet twists and writhes, you can feel the tension of invisible threads being pulled taut.
\i[塔罗护符]随着护身符的扭曲和蠕动，你感受到无形的丝线被绷到了最紧。
They are wrapped around the amulet, and around you.
它们缠绕着护身符，也同样缠绕着你。
Somewhere behind you they frayed into thousands of strands, and ahead of you they extend to somewhere distant.
在你身后的某处，它们成千上万，细如发丝；在你身前的某处，它们交织绵延，直至天际。
There they all end.
最终在这里结束。
You understand by now, don’t you? Makya is history.
你现在明白了吧？马凯亚已经成为了历史。
You, darling, are a history to me – a singular history.
亲爱的，你对我来说也是...是一段独特的历史。
And I am a singular history projected forward.
我是一段向前投射的独特历史。
You have the benefit of what we’ll call a privileged reference frame, and I thank you dearly for letting me glimpse through your eyes at it.
你拥有我们称为特权的优势，感谢你让我通过你的眼睛看到它。
Not to mention making a few… alterations.
更不用说...改动些许了。
Don’t think too hard on it, dearest.
别想太多，亲爱的。
\i[TAROTAMULET]The amulet has gone still.
\i[塔罗护符]护身符不见了。
Something is changing – the threads are being woven back together, or severed, or both.
有些东西正在发生变化...丝线正在重新编织在一起，又或者被重新切断。
Someone is taking matters into their own hands.
有人正在自作主张。
No, that isn’t me.
不，那不是我。
We both know who it is, though, don’t we?
我们都知道是谁，对吧？
You should probably stop her from doing that, or one of us could end up in the other’s place.
你也许应该阻止她这样做，否则我们中的1个，可能会在对方的位置上就此终结。
You were not made for the terminus, and I was not made for a utopia.
你不是为了终结而生，我也不是为了美好而生。
And no human was made for the paradise she’s planning.
没有谁是为了她的天堂而生。
…\PN, you know who I am, don’t you?
...\PN，你知道我是谁对吧？
We won’t be speaking for a little while, but know that I’m watching over you, child.
接下来我们有段时间没法再交流了，但我会看着你，孩子。
My child.
我的孩子。
…Agonizingly familiar.
...令人痛苦的熟悉感。
But, still, she is a stranger to you, this woman who almost has your mother’s voice.
但，她对你仍是个陌生人，即便她有着与你母亲几乎一致的声音。
\PN.
\PN。
I’m swallowing my pride here.
我在这里放下我的自尊。
I need your help with something... more important than my pride.
我需要你的帮助...这比我的自尊更重要。
You like that, don't you?
你喜欢这个，不是吗？
Helping people? Earning some coin along the way?
帮助别人？顺便赚点钱？
I know things are dire everywhere right now, but… that’s why I need someone of your skill level.
我知道现在到处都很糟糕，但...正因为如此，我需要像你这样水平的人。
Someone with experience cleaning up Team Chasm's mistakes.
1个有清理裂隙队错误经验的人。
Meet me in the <imp>Circuit Cave</imp>, it's under the <imp>Canal Desert</imp>.
在<imp>电路洞窟</imp>与我会面，它位于<imp>运河沙漠</imp>下方。

Hey champ, how's it hanging?
嘿冠军，最近怎么样?
Recently got a few uhh... assets, that I'm looking to sell. Fell off of a Trainer's backpack.
最近搞到了点...好货，都是从训练师的背包掉出来的，我想把它们出手掉。
I'm a nice guy, so I'll give you a nice price.
我这个人很好说话的，所以我会给你个合适的价钱。
You got $5000 on you? I've got a Numel with your name on it if so.
5000金钱有吗？要是有的话，这只呆火驼身上就写你名字了。
You sure? You ain't gonna find a deal like this again.
确定？过了这个村可就没这个店了。
Heh, pleasure doing business with ya.
呵呵，很高兴和你做生意。
\PN hands over $5000 in exchange.
\PN交给对方5000金钱。
Well, gotta hit the road. Cash is only useful if you spend it, ya know.
好了，我得走了。毕竟，钱只有花掉时才有用。
You missing the cash? Hmm.
唔，你说你手头紧？
You've... got your own set of problems, huh?
你...你也有自身的难处吧?
Formation 4C, Gurdurr!

We need to hit the gym. I hope Eko is taking challengers!

Oh… you destroyed it.
啊...你把它干掉了。
I was watching that avatar, and you just… dismissed it.
我正在观察那个化身，可是你给它...唉...
Well, it couldn’t last forever.
也是，它也不可能一直存在下去。
Nice to meet you. My name’s <imp>Skyler</imp>.
自我介绍一下，我是<imp>斯凯勒</imp>。
You were superb, by the way. Fought like the sun against the morning mist.
你刚刚的表现就如刺穿晨雾的阳光一般耀眼。
And, I suppose I can’t complain. I can leave now, at the very least.
我也没什么可抱怨的。至少现在可以离开这里了。
Skyler.
斯凯勒。
I don’t know what else you want me to say. I’m a traveler on a pilgrimage of sorts, which I can now continue.
我不知道你还想让我说什么，我只是1个正踏在朝圣之路上，并将继续走下去的旅者而已。
All thanks to you, of course.
当然，多亏了你我才能继续前进。
I’d opted to take a short nap before continuing my pilgrimage.
在朝圣的旅途中，我也需要在路边小睡一会儿。
Hah. Bit of a mistake. The avatar showed up while I was sleeping, not that I minded.
哈哈，所以那个化身，是在我睡觉时出现的，不过我倒是不怎么介意。
Makya’s a beautiful region, full of beautiful people. But I’m going to admit that I’m here for the avatars.
马凯亚是个美丽的地区，有着各种各样美丽的人们，不过我来这里就是为了这些化身。
Everyone’s concerned with how dangerous they are, but I think they’re missing the point.
所有人都只考虑自身的安危，我认为他们忽略了最重要的事。
We’ve gotten jaded. Pokémon used to be magical. We used to worship them. I think we’ve forgotten that.
我们变得麻木了，傲慢了。精灵是多么奇妙的存在，那时我们对它们尊之敬之。但现在的人们却遗忘了这一点。
So are you! Look how you fought!
你也跟他们一样！看看你战斗的样子就能明白了！
But I’m interested in you nonetheless. Call it a dangerous obsession or a leap of faith – your pick.
但无论现在你怎么想，我都对你很感兴趣。至于是危险的执念还是信仰升华，那要看你自身的想法如何变化了。
But were they always? You’ve heard legends of Pokémon raising mountains and oceans.
但它们一直都是现在这样吗？你应该也听说过那些传说吧？
We were created by Pokémon, and they’ll be the end of us someday.
我们人类是精灵创造的，也总有一天，它们会毁灭我们。
At least, that’s what they say of Arceus and Yveltal, not to mention all the rest.
这是人们对阿尔宙斯和伊裴尔塔尔的描述和看法，更何况传说中可不只有这两位。
I’m glad to hear you agree.
很高兴我们拥有共识。
Maybe it’s a foolish endeavor, seeking these things out. I’m sure they’d maul me given half a chance.
也许去寻找这些化身是种愚蠢的尝试，我敢肯定只要有机会，它们就会将我们撕成碎片。
But maybe reverence, not fear, is what they’re looking for.
但我在想有没有可能，它们要的，是敬畏，而并非恐惧。
In any case, I’m glad I met you. Technically, I suppose you saved me.
总之，很高兴认识你，严格意义上，也是你救了我。
I’ll be back on my little journey now, but, uh, I’ll see you again.
我要继续旅程了，不过，我们会再见的。
A trainer like you must be seeking badges, right? So let’s meet in the <imp>town ruined by avatars</imp>.
像你这样的训练师一定是在收集徽章吧？那么，<imp>被化身破坏的小镇见</imp>。
I hear there’s a gym leader there. So long, my knight in shining armor.
听说那里就有一位道馆馆主，就此别过，耀眼的骑士。
My grandpapa gave me this Tranquill. He's in the ground now. Wanna fight?
这只咕咕鸽是爷爷给我的礼物，现在他不在，我们打一架吧！
Welp, I've gotta go! Grandpapa's gonna give me a tour of the mines today!
好吧，我也得走了！爷爷说今天要带我参观矿山!
Tranquill! No! Use your Tranquill powers! ...oh.
不！咕咕鸽！快使用你的鸽之力！
Swirlix goes bye-bye...
咕咕鸽...
You with the rangers? Ah, doesn't matter. No one's nabbing our haul!
你是护林员那边的？哈，无所谓了，反正没人能抢走我们的战利品！
I swear, if our fourth was here, we'd kick your teeth in! Where'd that chick run off to, anyways? She needs some teeth-kicking too...
要是我们第4个队友在这里，肯定能把你打得满地找牙！那小妞到底跑哪去了？也太无组织无纪律了...
I've taken worse! If you think I'm done protecting the boss, you don't know me!
我什么局面没见过啊？你别以为我就这么放弃了，小瞧人也是有限度的！
Excuse me! We were about to settle this in battle.
不好意思，我们2个本打算通过战斗来解决问题的。
But, fine, I guess we can find common ground in disposing of you.
但是现在，我觉得可以在先除掉你这件事上达成共识。
...Hmph. Very well. I suppose brute force is your people's specialty. Follow my lead.
哼...很好。看来你的强项就是蛮力？那就试试看吧。
Bah! I have nothing left, and now she is free to waltz on in to the College. Is that what you wanted?
嘿！你把我的精灵都打败了，这样我就没法阻止她进入学校了，这就是你的目的？
No, you know what? I'm leaving.
谁稀罕？我要走了！
The only way I'm coming back is if it's with my dad and a few of his friends.
我会带着我爸爸和几个朋友，一块来讨个公道的！
I knew who you were the second I saw your last name on the role sheet.
哼，一听到你的姓，我就知道你是谁了。
The last time I heard it, it had "Lieutenant" in front of it.
上次听到这个姓的时候，后面还带着“中尉”2个字。
If only you'd inherited some of his prowess in battle, you might've made it past me. Go then, and don't come back.
哪怕只继承他一小部分实力，你也早就大白我了。所以滚吧，别丢人现眼了！
Urgh... oh, shove off, why don't you?
啊啊啊啊...你这人怎么这么碍事？
You too, you old hag.
还有你，碍事的老太婆！
I think you'll find me back here so long as you keep trying to gain entrance, you entitled brat.
不管你以后来多少次，我都会在这里挡住你的去路，自以为是的小鬼！
Makya's one of the few regions where creative archaeology is still legal. You're kinda lookin' like competition.
马凯亚是目前为数不多，仍允许进行考古创新研究的地区。你...莫不是竞争对手？
Maybe that's my cue to try a different tactic. I gotta be more subtle than challenging random strangers...
这或许是让我尝试不同策略的预警，看来以后得更加谨慎地行事了...
Well ain't that a cryin' shame. Guess Makya's a bit rougher than I thought...
真是令人悲愤的耻辱感啊。看来马凯亚比我想象中更棘手...
Those Evolution Stones are all ours! You can't have any!
那些进化石都是我们的！你1个也别想带走！
Aagh! Fine! I'll leave! I've got my evolutions, anyways.
啊啊！行吧！我走我走！反正我已经拿到想要的进化石了。
...I'll be back. I'll be back, and if I ever see you again, things're gonna be different. I swear I'll...
...我一定会回来的。下次再见到你，一切都会不同。我发誓...我一定会...
The berry plant is growing.

Yo...so I heard there was like, some items to steal on this route?

I got nothin' to say. You good at battling.
我无话可说，你很擅长对战。
Bruh. Ok then, I guess.
我觉得，差不多吧。
I refuse to let someone like her into the Academy.
我不会允许她这样的人入学的。
We have enough of her sort at the Academy as it stands...
学校里她这样的学生已经太多了...
Listen, kid, I'm gonna give you one last warning: you can either hit the road, or bite the dust. No? Fine. We'll do it the hard way.
听着，小鬼，最后1次警告：要么滚蛋要么死！什么？好吧。那我们就用硬的。
Hah, well, you win some, you lose some. I'm not so broken up about it.
哈，好吧，有赢有输，也不是不能接受。
Helena can't afford proper guards for LuxTech's shipments, so there'll always be business for me. See you around, hero.
海莲娜请不起称职的警卫来看管光华的货物，所以我一直都有生意可做。回头见了，小英雄。
C'mon, kid. We're not giving up on this little nook unless we have to... and I'm not scared of your little posse.
来吧，小鬼。除非万不得已，否则我们不会放弃这个地方...而且我也不怕你们这群人。
No thanks.
不要。
I'll take it.
我要了。
Hello.
啊，你好。

I imported all these Geodudes from Alola to study their geomagnetic properties, but the moment I let them out this avatar appeared!
我为了研究地磁性质课题，从阿罗拉进口了这些小拳石，但是我刚把它们放出来，那个化身就出现了！
I don't know what to do, it's made the Geodudes go into a frenzy!
我不知道该怎么办，它让小拳石们都疯了！
If you could defeat it for me, I'll be waiting over here.
你能帮我打败它吗？我实在解决不了这种问题。
If you could defeat the avatar over there for me, I'll be waiting here.
你能帮我打倒那里的化身吗？我实在解决不了这种问题。
Goodness me, thank you. Here, take this Geodude.
天哪，谢谢你。来，这只小拳石给你了。
You not only deserve a reward, but my hypothesis is that the avatar appeared when I had so many together in one place....
这是你应得的，另外我怀疑是不是有太多小拳石聚集在一起，才导致了化身的出现...
My hypothesis is that the avatar appeared when I had too many Alolan Geodudes together in one place....
我怀疑是不是有太多阿罗拉小拳石聚集在一起，才导致了化身的出现...

I really wish the vendor here would sell coffee.
真希望这里的商店能卖咖啡。
There's a high demand for it, and no one wants to walk through an entire cave just to visit the cafe in Novo Town.
这里的大家对咖啡的需求量很大，总不能天天为了买咖啡，还要穿过山洞去望新镇吧？
I was supposed to have a meeting with Kurt today about gracefully decommissioning some of the cluster, but he never showed up.
我今天本来要跟库特开个会，讨论如何从容地退役回家，但他一直都没来。
Doesn’t he know that maintaining legacy systems adds unnecessary fragility?
难道他理解不了维护过去只会让一切变得更脆弱吗？
A Shiny Corviknight!
是闪光钢铠鸦！
It's too busy watching the campus to notice you.
它忙着巡视校园，根本没注意到你。
You and Helena had something secretive to discuss, is that it?
听说你和海莲娜有秘密要谈?
I'd love to ask, but, well, I need this job more than I need to satisfy my curiosity.
我很想问，但是，比起满足我的好奇心，能留住这份工作更重要。
Either way, that was a great battle!
不管怎样，那都是一场精彩的战斗！

Just because they used to be Helena's lieutenants doesn't mean she won't have their hide if she catches them cutting corners!
就算他们以前是海伦娜的副官，如果被发现失职行为，也一定会受到严厉处罚的。
It’s hard to get promoted when the top level talent here are former Team Chasm lieutenants.
这里的高级人才都是前裂隙队的干部，一般人很难得到晋升。

我会在这里等你准备好。
I'm gonna show you the difference between strategy and tactics!
让我告诉你战略与战术的区别吧！
Just like that, my team's put to the sidelines.
我的队伍就这样被打败了。
A knack for tactics, that's what you got. Helena'll be impressed, I know it.
这就是你的战斗诀窍？海伦娜一定会对你刮目相看的。
Healing centers uhh... to the west. So go off and do that now.
治疗中心呃...在西边，现在就去吧。

治疗中心呃...在西边。现在赶紧去治疗吧。
She just switches around a lot? That's the "tactics" everyone around here's been hyping up?
她只是在频繁的换精灵？这就是他们鼓吹的“战术”？
I'm a bit dissapointed. Well, let's avoid getting too cocky. I should actually make my attempt before judging.
我有点失望...不过，也不能太自大了，我应该先试试，再做判断才对。
Bye bye!

Visiting the ice cave seems wonderful, but the looming threat of Avatars really throws a wrench in things...
我觉得冰窟是个很不错的景点，但最近化身的活跃，又让我开始打退堂鼓了...
You ever have someone bother you out of nowhere?
你有没有被莫名其妙地打扰过?
Just have your Pokemon give 'em one of these, and they'll leave you alone quick.
只要让你的精灵学会这个，他们就会主动远离你了。
Yeah, that'll do.
没错，这样就行了。
Either you give 'em one of those, or you bribe 'em with some stuff you don't need.
要么给他们来一记这样的技能，要么用你不需要的东西贿赂他们。
The door is securely locked.

Helena juggles leadership in this company with contract work for the Makyan government, and even then still finds time to train Pokemon for her gym.
海伦娜不仅要担任公司的决策层，还得为马凯亚政府提供各种协助，即便如此，她也能抽出自身的时间，为道馆训练手下的精灵。
If you plan on facing her, you best be wary of her hit and run tactics.
如果你打算挑战她，一定要提防她的“打了就跑”战术。
Most of her Pokemon use switch-out moves: Flip Turn, Volt Switch, or U-Turn.
她大部分精灵都会类似于快速折返，伏特替换之类的技能。
If you want a leg up, hazards like Stealth Rocks and Spikes can help a lot.
如果你想抢占先机，可以用隐型岩之类的对付她。

Setting up an office in Makya hasn't helped their PR situation, though.
但是他们在公关上有大问题。
In theory, they're thoroughly vetting all hires for past Chasm ties, and Helena's just an advisor... but we all know she's running the show.
上面一直监视着有裂隙队背景的人，虽说以前海伦娜名义上只是顾问...但大家都知道，她其实是管理层。
Not a good look for the company that recently switched mottos to "Innovation, Inspiration, Integrity."
就算公司的口号已经改成了“创新，灵感与诚信”，也不会对此有什么帮助。
Yikes.
唉...
Oh, I see you have a MasterDex.
哦，你有大师图鉴！
I have one of those myself. I got it from when I worked under Miss – er, Professor Tamarind.
我自身也有1个。这是我之前在塔玛琳小姐...呃，塔玛琳博士手下工作时得到的。

The protection racket was bad enough. Now they’re desecrating a tomb.

I’ll bet they’ve found all four prison cells…
我敢打赌他们已经找到了所有4个牢房...
What are they going to do with those… disasters…?
他们打算用那些...灾难...做什么？
Nothing, if I can help it. It’s the least I can do after—
如果我能做到的话，什么都不会让他们做。这是我在——之后能做的最少的事。
\PN!
\PN！
How much of that did you hear?
你听到了多少？
We’ll finish this later.
我们稍后会继续。
I’m sure you have questions.
我知道你肯定有问题。
Keep them to yourself.

You want to know how my makeup stays fresh with all this ash?

The truth is that I am... a beast of the forest, come to take your soul!
其实我是...沼泽妖怪，来取走你的灵魂!
But, seriously, you don't want to know how this stuff stays on.
但是说真的，你肯定不想知道这东西是怎么贴在脸上的。
And with that mystery left alluringly open, I will take my leave.
你就自身考虑下这个答案吧，告辞咯！
Hahaha! You should've seen your face! It was so... you.
哈哈哈！你真该看看你自身的脸！它是那么的...像你。
The berry plant is growing.

Fighting alongside a Voltorb is a dangerous game, but I dribble nonetheless. It is my fate.
与霹雳电球并肩作战是一场危险的游戏，但我不会改变自身的想法，这，即是我的命运。

总有一天，我的孩子也会问我，“我的启蒙老师是谁，”我会告诉他，每个提醒我不要总发脾气的人都是我的老师。
This was not a failure, for I am unexploded, and every unexploded day is a blessing.
这不是失败，因为我还没爆炸，每个没有爆炸的日子都是上天给我的恩赐。
My last batch of mushrooms went rancid.
我之前采的蘑菇都馊了。
Which stinks!
完了个蛋！
Well, to tell you the truth, I couldn't smell the difference.
说实话，我倒是闻不出什么不对来。
So I need to get meself acquainted with the smell of healthy mushrooms.

Appreciate it. Now, lemme get this over with.

This is a premiere Bug-type training ground! Samorn told me herself!
塞蒙告诉我说，这里非常适合训练虫属性精灵！
Maybe I'm the worm...

Down but not out! The true power of the Bug-type!
败而不倒，这才是虫属性真正的力量!
Samorn trains Dragon-types as well! How cool is that!
塞蒙竟然同时训练龙属性！这真是太酷啦！
Not as cool as bugs though.
但龙怎么能跟虫比！
The true self can only be found by exploring the world, and beating the crap out of random people you find on the way!
只有通过探索世界，痛殴路上的训练师，才能实现真正的自我！
After that thrashing I'm gonna have to self-actualize extra-violently to make up! See ya in Kalos!
在挨了那顿揍之后，我要更加暴力地去弥补自我的实现！我们在卡洛斯再见！
Ah, a fellow seeker of enlightenment. Best of luck!

I saw a band of troubadours in that cave beyond the fence.
我看到一些穿着奇怪的演员进到那个被围着栅栏的洞里了。
Do you know anything about them?
你知道他们在干什么吗？
I heard boisterous exclamations of wonder.
我听到了一些奇怪的声音。
It's ever so compelling, don't you agree?
你也注意到了，对吧？
Maybe they're up to something...something suspicious?

找到了
[Map8]
My cousin and I like to hang out here. Take in the cool atmosphere and the night sky.
我和表弟常在这儿发呆，感受清凉夜风和星空。
We still battle people, but like... in a chill way...
我们也会对战，不过...主打1个佛系...
I'm gonna leave now. Don't like your vibes.
我要走了。你气场好怪。
Can you feel the energy given off by those evolution stones?
能感受到进化石散发的能量吗？
It's doing wonders for my stress.
对缓解焦虑有奇效。
Is life worth living if you can't take time to be transfixed by the beauty of nature?
如果连驻足感受自然之美的时间都没有，活着还有啥意思？
Hey there. Miss me?
嘿，想我了吗？
I finally got here – all thanks to you. I have to say, you don’t look a mite worse for wear considering how much wilderness you trekked through.
终于到地方了...再次感谢你之前帮我脱困。不过我很意外，穿过了一大片沼泽，你看起来却并无疲惫感。
I can’t cope as well as you can – I need a hot bath and soon.
没想到你竟然这么强...我不行，我得找地方洗个热水澡。
This is the place to be if one’s looking for avatars, or so I heard.
我听说这里是寻找化身的好去处。
I must have heard right, because I’ve already found more than I can count on both hands.
显然这并不是谣言，来到这边之后，我见到的化身已经超过两手之数了。
Are you in a rush?
你在赶时间？
All business and no pleasure might not make you dull, but it does make you a bore.
如果人没有时间娱乐，早晚有时间生病。
So come on – we’re young and free. You can take a few minutes off, can’t you?
尽请挥霍年轻带来的自由吧，在这里歇歇脚不好吗？
Skyler, at your service. We met back in the grassland, between a few avatars.
我是斯凯勒，之前在草地那边见过，当时旁边还有1个化身。
The sun and moon were smiling on us, you came to my rescue…
当日月都对我露出微笑时，是你来救我于水火之中...
I could exaggerate further but the truth is striking enough.
我可以用更夸张的方式形容我们之间的相遇，不过事实就已经很梦幻了。
But enough about the two of us. Let’s talk about the specters roaming the town.
关于我们的事情，差不多就聊到这里吧，现在说说这镇子上的幽灵。
They’re so… arrogant. Have you ever noticed that?
你注意到了吗？它们简直...太傲慢了。
They just don’t care about us fleshy creatures – human or Pokémon. All they seem to notice is the land, each other, and a few very specific objects.
它们根本不在乎我们这些还拥有血肉的生物，它们似乎只在意彼此的领土，以及某些极为特殊的东西。
I know this asking a lot, but… can I borrow a Moon Stone from you?
我知道这个要求很过分，但我...能问你借一块月之石吗?
The avatars seem to notice the incredible power inside those stones.
化身们似乎注意到了进化石中蕴含的惊人力量。
Unless you’re asking me why a Moon Stone, in which case, well, I decided apropos of nothing.
至于为什么是月之石...好吧，我随便选的。
That’s not entirely true – I don’t want to offend them with a clashing element.
倒也不是完全随意选的...我不想用相冲的能量激怒它们。
Fire, Water, Sun, the like. And Moon just fits the ambience.
像是火、水、太阳那些...月亮刚好符合这个氛围。
Safe bet, hmm? So if you have one to spare, please let me know. I’ll pay you back with interest later.
这是个很安全的决策，对吧？所以如果你可以借我，那么将来，我会连本带利还给你的。
Ah, fair. I am bringing business into pleasure again, aren’t I? I’m horribly bad at this.
啊，也对。我又把工作和私人生活搞混了，我也对自身这个问题很头疼。
Well, if you change your mind, you know where to find me.
如果改变主意了，你知道到哪里能找到我。
I assure you, I’ll pay you back eventually, plus extra.
我向你保证，将来会连本带利还给你的。
Well that was quick. Honestly, you shouldn’t be so generous! Someone could take advantage of that.
嗯？这么爽快？老实说，你不该那么大方，很容易被别人利用的。
I’ve never turned down someone’s hospitality, especially someone like you, but take a minute.
我从不拒绝别人的好意，特别是你，但请先思索一下。
Think about it. I’ll make sure to pay you back, but don’t rush into this.
思索一下是否要借给我这么贵重的物品。当然我肯定会还给你的，但请不要随随便便做出决定。
So, care to part with a Moon Stone?
那么，你能把一颗月之石借给我吗？
Just come to see me, then? I appreciate it – and I appreciate seeing you, too.
也就是说，你是来看我的？我真的很高兴。
You’ll have to teach me how you stay so composed in places like this. Sometime later, hmm?
晚些时候，能不能教教我怎么在这种地方保持淡定，好吗？
You hand over the Moon Stone.
你将月之石交给他。
Thank you very much. I understand these are valuable, even leaving evolution out of the picture.
真的太感谢了，我知道，即便你不需要它，它的价值也不会因此减小。
If one of your Pokémon passed up evolution for this, give them my regards.
如果你的精灵因此放弃了进化的机会，那请代我谢谢它。
I’ll be sure to tell you the results of this offering next we meet.
再次见面时，我肯定会给你带来好消息的。
And repay you, of course! What do you say to dinner? There’s a place in <imp>Prizca East</imp>.
当然是报答你啦！请你吃顿晚饭咋样？<imp>东宏礼市</imp>的美食挺不错的。
Well, you can think on it – I need to track down an avatar, and you need to beat some gym leaders.
不过现在，是时候行动了...我得去追踪1个化身，而你得打败一些道馆馆主。
Until we meet again.
下次再会。
I hate to be a spoilsport, but, uh, that isn’t a Moon Stone.
我实在不想扫你的兴，可这不是月之石。
I appreciate the effort, trust me – you’re very generous. I just can’t work with it, though. You keep it.
我很感激你的心意...你真的很大方。只是这个对我来说没什么用，你还是自身留着吧。
Avatars seem to care about these stones.
化身似乎对这些石头很感兴趣。
I want to see if I can’t make an offering. Perhaps placate them?
我想试着能不能用这种方式，安抚一下它们的情绪？
And a Moon Stone seems the least likely to offend the ones here in Velenz.
在夜幽市这种地方，月之石应该不会冒犯到它们。
Something like a Fire or Sun Stone would clash, and a Leaf or Dusk Stone is more of what they already have.
而火之石、日之石这些就跟这里的气氛相冲了，至于叶之石或暗之石...貌似它们已经有了。
I promise it’s a good cause.
我相信自身的判断没错。
Improper planning ruined this place. I just know it.
规划不善毁了这里，我早该料到。
Founding a town over a cave system? In a swamp?
在溶洞上建城镇？还选在沼泽地？
No, no... I would anticipate such troubles. That's what I do.
不不...这本该是我的专业范畴。
I've even prepared a way to win battles: A very powerful move that deals damage after a two turn delay.
我甚至准备了必杀技：延迟两回合爆发的强力技能。
I'd like to teach one of your Pokemon this technique. I'm sure you can see the value in it.
想给你的精灵传授这招吗？你肯定明白它的价值。
All according to plan.
一切尽在掌控。
Hm, I didn't expect you to say no.
啧，没想到你会拒绝。
The math... I must have miscalculated...
计算...出了偏差...
Velenz Gym
夜幽道馆
Leader: Rafael
馆主：拉斐尔
...
...
It seems like the Gym Leader was supposed to write a title here, but the space has been left blank.
按照惯例，馆主应该在最后一行写些什么，但这里被空出来了。
A notice about the Makyan Regional Tournament has been hastily scribbled over.
一张关于马凯亚锦标赛的通知，被潦草地涂抹后扔掉了。
A note added below reads "Not Taking Challengers"
下面增加了一行注释："不接受挑战者"
Don't tell the others, but I'm getting bored of waiting.
别告诉其他人，但我等得有点无聊了。
Well, might as well battle you before <i>they</i> arrive.
算了，在<i>他们</i>来之前，不如和你打一场。
I saw a light come down from the sky and land west of Velenz.
我看到一道光从天而降，落在了维伦兹的西边。
I was hoping these stones would draw the aliens out, but it's been a week and nothing.
我本来指望这些石头能引出外星人，但一周过去了，啥也没有。
Since that failed, you can just take them. Good luck.
既然失败了，你就拿走吧。祝你好运。
Losing? Now that's an alien feeling.
输掉？这还真是种陌生的感觉。
That mansion near the menagerie must have something to do with the light I saw.
那座靠近动物园的豪宅一定和我看到的光有关。
My cousin says I'm paranoid, but I definitely saw the place glowing last night.
我表弟说我多疑，但我昨晚确实看到那地方在发光。
"Velenz, proud home of-"
"夜幽市，我骄傲的故..."
Claw marks on the sign render the text unreadable.
上面的字迹被爪痕破坏得难以识别。
Temporary Velenz Ranger Outpost

I thought this place was supposed to be scary.
我以为这地方会很可怕。
Just seems peaceful to me.
只不过是比别处安静罢了。
Eek! You're the scary one here!
哎呀！你才是最可怕的!
I'm afraid of bugs, but not ghosts.
我怕虫子，但不怕鬼。
To be honest, this town hasn't been that scary.
说真的，这里真没什么吓人的。
I'm having a good time, so I'll hang out here for now.
我在这里玩得挺开心的，所以我会多呆一阵子。
Got some rare things on sale, stranger!
陌生人，我这里有东西要卖！
Come back anytime.
随时再来哦。
No earthlings allowed: that's the rule.
地球人禁止入内：这是规矩。
By the power of the Moon Stone, I will punish you!
以月之石的力量，我将惩罚你！
What? Friendship wasn't enough!?
什么？友情还不够吗！？
You're really gonna invade our special space like this?
你真要这样闯入我们的专属空间吗？
I haven't been a real sailor since they scuttled my ship.
自从他们凿沉了我的船，我就不算真正的船员了。
I just like the clothes.
我只是喜欢这身衣服。

东：枯槁森林
South: Barren Crater

There's supposed to be a gym leader around here, but he's not keen on taking challengers.
据说这里有一位道馆馆主，但他并不喜欢接受挑战。
He lives <imp>underground</imp> like some hermit.
他就跟个隐士似的住在<imp>地下</imp>某处。
Even locked himself up to make it harder to get in.
为了不被外人打扰，甚至把自身锁了起来。
Apparently the <imp>lock combination code</imp> is somewhere in the town.
而那把锁的<imp>密码</imp>，就在这座废弃城市的某个地方。
This is all a bit too mental for me right now, so I'm taking a break.
但这周围的一切让我有些神经过敏，我得休息一会儿了。
A small handmade sign. It lists an eight-digit code in a big, blocky style.
1个手工制作的小牌子，其中内嵌了1个八位数的密码锁。
Rafael may have a layer of earth protecting him from the surface, but it doesn't protect him from my astral projection.
拉斐尔可能觉得在地底可以安然无恙，但这并不能保护他不受我的探测。
I've been watching his battles with some fervor. I wish to grasp the essence of his strategy.
我一直在关注着他的战斗，希望自身能掌握他的精髓。
It is, at its core, about dancing.
他的对策核心是舞蹈。
His Oricorio and Alolan Marowak both gain power from dancing done by their allies.
他的花舞鸟跟阿罗拉嘎啦嘎啦，都能从队友的舞蹈中汲取力量。
If one was feeling particularly devilish, one could aquire a Hattrem.
如果1个人觉得自身特别邪恶，就能得到1个提布莉姆。
That witch has a special ability which can prevent Pokemon from utilizing dance.
而这种精灵有一种特殊能力，可以阻止精灵使用舞蹈。
Hey again. Bet you didn't expect to see me in a place like this, eh?
又见面了。没想到会在这儿见到我吧？
I'm good at battling, less so at cryptic riddles and haunted towns.
我擅长对战，但对解谜和闹鬼小镇可不在行。
But, let's not let my failures go to waste.
不过，别让我的失败白费了。
Put the searching on hold for now, and engage in a little sparring.
先把搜索放一放，来场小对战吧。
Talk to me again when you see the value in that idea.
等你觉得这主意不错时，再来找我。
Fighting me's better than fighting any of those Avatars, I'd wager. Prove me right?
我敢说，和我打比和那些化身打有意思多了。证明我说得对吧？
Understood.
明白了。
I'll be here until you wish to battle.
我会一直在这里，直到你想对战。
Boo!
吓一跳吧！
I bow to thee, oh masterful one.
向您鞠躬，哦，大师。
Eh, that was pretty good, I guess.
嗯，还不错吧。
Some rangers set up a rest spot in the southern part of Velenz.
一些巡护员在维伦兹南部设了个休息点。
Check it out, heal up your party, get back to me.
去看看，治疗你的队伍，然后回来找我。
Some rangers set up a rest spot to the south.
一些巡护员在南边设了个休息点。
You unlocked Rafael's front door?! That sure saves me the time and frustration.
你打开了拉斐尔家的前门？！这可省了我不少时间和麻烦。
Much appreciated, fellow trainer! Off I go!
非常感谢，训练师朋友！我走啦！
Why are you here?
你为什么在这？
Is this going somewhere?
你来这里干什么？
Who are you?

Maybe later.
也许晚点吧。

当然，走吧。
[Map9]
STAY AWAY FROM MY PLANTS!
离我的花草远点!
I give up. My plants are doomed to die.
我放弃了，我注定无法保护它们...
To be honest, they're not even my plants. I just wanted to make a nice bouquet for Lainie.
其实这些花草并不是我种的，我只是想给兰妮做1个花束。
I just want to protect my plants.
我只是想保护我的植物。
To be honest, they're not even my plants. I don't know who left them here.
其实这些花草并不是我种的，我也不知道是谁留在这里的。
I was looking around the sinkhole for the Gym Leader, but he wasn't anywhere around there.
一开始来这里是找馆主的，但他貌似不在这附近。
[Map10]
I'm training for my doctorate in Pokemon Biology.
我在攻读精灵生物学博士学位。
"Do some field work!", they said. "It'll look great on your CV!', they said.
他们都说，“去实地调研吧！这会让你的简历看起来更棒！”
Now here I am, battling the Raikou down there every day to prevent a rampage.
所以我才来到这里，为了防止雷皇暴走，每天都在与它进行对战。
Can't say I'm learning nothing though...
基本什么都没学到...
Phew... Glad that's over. I've had enough battling to last a lifetime.
唉哟...终于结束了。我已经把这辈子的对战都打完了。
Time to transfer all my notes to PDF format. Hope the scanners aren't reserved today...
是时候将所有的记录转成PDF格式了。希望扫描仪今天没有被人预约......
Novo College sends us a daily batch of healing items to keep us going.
望新大学每天都会给我们送来一批治疗药物，用来维持我们精灵的健康。
It's useful, but I don't think my team appreciates getting revived four times a day...
这虽然很有用，但我觉得我的队伍不喜欢一天被复活4次...
Sheesh, felt the shockwaves all the way back here.
天啊，我甚至在这里也感受到了震颤。
Must have been rough. Glad you showed up.
这一定很艰难，但你成功了。
The only thing that's kept Novo safe from this Avatar is us members of the Battle Club.
唯一保护望新免受化身威胁的就是我们这些对战俱乐部的成员。
The regular folks sure are lucky so many skilled trainers decided to concentrate there...
这里的居民太走运了，有那么多实力高超的训练师都聚集在那里...
Wowie, now that was a battle!
哇，这才叫战斗!
The club's gonna love to hear about this one.
俱乐部会很高兴听到这个消息。
You should totally come give a talk sometime.
你应该来给我们做个演讲，效果肯定很不错。
[Map11]
The berry plant is growing.
树果还在生长中。
Since the Eleig River is in the halfway point of Makya, it's become quite the gathering spot for Trainers.
由于埃利格河位于马凯亚的中心，因此成为了训练师们的聚集地。
The trainers on the long stretch of river to the East are relatively casual.
东部河道上的训练师相对随和一些。
That is, until you reach the desert research station.
朝那个方向可以直接到沙漠研究站。
The trainers to the west are a bit more serious, especially as one approaches the Cave of Hatching.
而西边河道的训练师就严肃多了，尤其是启明之窟附近。
Hey, yo. Remember me?
嘿，你还记得我吗?
Eifion – guy with the Phione? How you doing?
我是艾维恩，带着霏欧纳的那位。你最近怎么样?
Awesome. You doing the gym challenge?
太好了，你是在挑战道馆？
Ah, what am I asking – of course you are.
我在说什么啊...这不是肯定的事吗...
Nobody hauls around a killer team like that just for fun. Good luck on that.
没人会为了好玩带着这么强力的队伍。祝你挑战顺利。
Sure, sure. Don’t mean to pry or anything. Happy to see you’re holding up.
啊，我不是想打听什么。只是很高兴看到你过得不错。
Yeah, I get that. I’ve been, uh, yeah, through the wringer, y’know?
啊，大概能理解。呃，我也曾经历过...类似的状况。
But you just gotta keep your head up.
但你微笑着面对一切，挺过难关就好。
Anyways, how about a quick match?
不管怎样，来一场速战速决如何?
Phione here hasn’t been slacking, and I want to show it a proper duel.
霏欧纳可不是吃素的，我要好好展现一下它的实力。
You down?
你准备好了吗？
Oh, yeah, take your time. I think I might need a few minutes to get Phione psyched up anyways.
哦，没问题，慢慢来。我也得花一些时间让霏欧纳准备准备。
Thanks. Don’t go easy on me, OK?
谢谢，请不要手下留情。
Whoa. We actually did it.
哇，我们真的做到了。
Not without some scrapes here and there – wait, let me heal you.
有些磕碰也是在所难免的...稍等，让我帮你治疗一下。
Figure I might as well pay you back, huh?
我一直觉得，该报答你一下。
Uh, kinda? I’ve trained worse, but, uh, this little fella isn’t exactly a juggernaut.
呃，还好吧？我见过更难对付的精灵，而且...呃...这个小家伙也不是啥凶猛巨兽。
I wouldn’t be quaking in my boots if I had to face one.
我之前对上的要是这小家伙，也不会被吓得瑟瑟发抖了。
OK, I think Phione’s good to go. Ready to fight?
好了，我感觉霏欧纳准备好了，可以开始战斗了吗？
Good fight, good fight! Phione, you did great.
打得好，打得好！霏欧纳，干得漂亮。
I mean, \PN, you obviously did way better, but, hey, that’s how it goes.
虽然\PN，你的表现更好，但嘿嘿，事实就是事实。
I used to do a lot better than this. Was pretty good, if I do say so myself, but, eh, it wasn’t really worth it.
要我来说的话，我以前那会儿更强呢，但是....呃，过去就不提了。
You ever run into someone yelling at his Pokémon after he loses and just think, like, who raised this guy?
你有没有遇到过那种输掉比赛后对自身的精灵大发雷霆的人？你会不会觉得那些家伙...很没教养？
Like, yeah, you get results, but it’s not really sustainable.
或许那样能让他们多赢一场，但并不利于长久发展。
They have to feel like living, feeling beings first, and tools of battle second.
培育精灵就要让它们意识到自身存在的重要，其次才是把它们当作对战工具。
Or, like, fifth.
呃...感觉还要往后排...
You get what I’m saying, right?
你能明白我什么意思吧？
Figured as much. Look at me talking at you as if you aren’t obviously a better trainer than me.
我觉得也是，这么跟你说话，搞得好像我比你优秀一样。
I’m OK, but I make a lot of sloppy mistakes. Still trying to learn that whole positive reinforcement thing.
我的水平也就...那样吧，经常犯一些粗心大意的错误，最近才开始学习心理强化。
You just gotta make them feel loved, and then they’ll try their best.
只要让它们感受到爱，它们就会全力以赴。
Pushing them hard wrings potential out of them faster, but it burns them out.
对它们过度施压虽然能更快地榨取出潜力，但也会让它们身心交瘁。
Eventually they’ll snap back, or just give up. Or leave you.
最终只会反噬到自身，要么干脆摆烂，要么永远离开你。
Well, sure, but they’re more than tools. They’re alive, and they have their own wants and needs.
好吧，当然，但它们不仅仅是工具。它们也是生命，它们也有自身的欲望和需求。
And if you kinda lean into that, it works so much better than ordering them around.
如果你能稍微顺应这点，那比直接命令它们效果好得多。
Or… maybe not. Obviously you know what you’re doing. I’m not gonna preach to you.
或许...也不一定。显然你知道自身在干什么，我就不对你说教了。
I’ve talked enough. Probably should be listening more, but, uh, I gotta go.
我说得已经够多了，也许你并不介意，但是...呃，我得走了。
Makya’s a big place, and Phione and I are gonna tour the whole thing.
马凯亚地区面积不小，我和霏欧纳要游遍这里的每一处角落。
And the rest of us, of course. So, uh, see you. And thanks again.
当然，还有我的其他精灵，那么，呃，再见，再次谢谢你啦。
Li'l bit of havoc going down around here, just like the good ol' days! I'll show ya why we used to be the top dogs!
最近这里有一些小骚动，就像我所怀念的以前一样！我会向你展示我们曾是顶尖训练师的原因！
Beaten by another freakishly-talented kid? Deja vu, that's what that is...
又被另1个天赋异禀的小鬼打败了？怎么总是这样...
Ah, you ain't nothing. I could beat you any day of the week. Just not... today.
啊，你什么都不是。我哪天都能赢你。只不过不是...今天。
I totally lost my surfboard!
我的冲浪板丢了！
At least I can swim.
好在我会游泳。
Prizca Bridge
宏礼大桥
Prizca Sewers Auxiliary Entrance
宏礼下水道辅助出口
A line which might have read "Authorized Personnel Only" has been crisscrossed with crude graffiti.
下面大概写着“仅限工作人员”，但被粗暴地划掉了。
I was thinking of bringing my toddlers to see the bridge. Guess that plan is ruined.
我本来想带孩子们来大桥这边玩的，现在看来计划泡汤了。
Field trip's cancelled!
活动取消！
I'll look on my phone for anything interesting nearby.
我该去网上查查，周围有什么其他有趣的地方。
Maybe I schedule a trip to the Gym?
或许...道馆一日游？
North: Prizca West
北：西宏礼市
South: County Park
南：国立公园
West: Frostflow Farms
西：风霜农场
East: Eleig Stretch
东：埃利格中游
Why'd they send a waitress to keep watch when an avatar's on the prowl? This is why!
为什么在化身四处游荡时派一名女服务员来看守？这就是原因！
So, uh, when I said "this is why!" I was supposed to then beat you, and that, uh, didn't happen. So... I'm just gonna go now.
所以，嗯，当我说“这就是原因！”的时候，本该揍你一顿，但是...好吧...我现在得走了。
Well, uh... I guess you're gonna have to cover my shift, 'cause I gotta go hit the Pokécenter.
呃，嗯...你得替我值班了，因为我要去精灵中心。
Now that the bridge is gone, I can swim in peace. Or I could if it wasn't for kids like you!
现在桥没了，如果不是因为你这样的小孩，我早就能安心游泳了！
Wow, you're just as annoying as the cars. I'm out.
哇，你跟那些车一样讨厌，我得走了。
Cool surfing kid, but don't put me in the splash zone next time.
小子，冲浪很酷，但下次别溅我一身水。
No one else comes here, so I guess we're just a little strange.
居然没有人来这里，这也太奇怪了。
Great.
很好
Fine.
还行
Could be better.
不太好
Let me prep.
稍等一会儿
Sure, let's go.
好，来吧
Aren't Phione strong?

门咔嗒一声开了。
Hey, Trainer. You seem like the classy type.
嘿，训练师，你的气质很非比寻常嘛。
Let me guess. Born rich? Toxic family relationships? Rampant imposter syndrome coupled with a crippling need to define yourself?
让我猜猜...出身豪门？家庭关系不合？强烈渴望成功的灵魂？对自我价值实现的强烈需求？
Well, you look like the perfect fit for this Skitty I've managed to get.
你看起来很适合我搞到的这只向尾喵。
For the absolute steal of $200,000, I'll let you get your hands on one. And guess what -- it's shiny.
只需要200,000金钱，它就是你的了，而且你猜怎么着 - 它是闪光的！
Show that to your... mom? Dad? No, definitely mom. Probably a sibling in there as well, huh?
拿给你的...妈妈或爸爸看？不，绝对是妈妈，估计还有1个兄弟姐妹吧？
I'm sure you'll get at least a week's worth of self- worth flaunting that to them. All that quality time for just $200,000.
拿这个跟他们炫耀后，至少能获得一星期的昂首挺胸权。只要200,000金钱哦，心动不如行动！
Hah! That's what they all say. You'll be back, sooner or later.

The Pokemon is all yours, enjoy it while you can.
这精灵是你的了，尽情享受被尊重的感觉吧。
And with that, my early retirement has been secured.
有了这笔钱，我就可以提前退休了。
Tata suck- uhh, client.
再见了，冤大...咳，客人。
With that trifling sum? Surely you can do better than that.
只不过是一笔小钱而已嘛？你得到的可远超这个价值。
Ah, so you've finally caved? $200,000 for the shiny Skitty. No more, no less.
啊，终于想通了？200,000金钱买这只闪光向尾喵。
Are you going into the sauna?
你要去蒸桑拿吗?
Careful to not go into the underground area. It's where we keep the wild Pokemon that heat up the place.
请不要进入地下区域，那里关着我们用来发热的野生精灵。
Unless you want to catch said wild Pokemon I guess...
除非你想抓几只...
Well, if you get hurt down there, that's on you.
但是受伤了概不负责！
The sauna is only available to the Rangers and their families.
桑拿房只对护林员和其家人开放。
You'll need a ID Card to get in there.

Thank you for playing our game!

You've found Riptide, a developer and designer.
你找到了Riptide，一位开发者和设计师。
Although "found" may not be the correct term, maybe "endured your way to me" is it.
虽然“找到”可能不是正确的词，也许“忍受着来到我这里”更合适。
Since well, you made it through my carefully constructed gauntlet of nuzlockers and perfecters.
因为你成功通过了我精心设计的Nuzlockers和完美主义者的考验。
Now let us see if the AI can steer my signature strategy. Have fun!

Eh, I can't blame ya. It's dangerous stuff.

They basically looked at a spot, decided they wanted to build an entire tech campus over it, and they did it.
他们1次次地在荒芜之地，凭空建立起一座座城镇，甚至还有这个科技园区。
Wild stuff.
太疯狂了。

A home review show is playing on the television.
电视上正在播放家庭节目。
The host is obviously enthused, but the sound is muted, so it's hard to tell what specifically she's excited about.
主持人的表情显得很兴奋，但电视的声音太小了，你根本听不清她在说什么。
A dim light shines from the computer.
电脑指示灯亮着。
Hey y'all! We've got a super special report on the latest in Pokemon!
大家好，我们将在此，为大家报道最新的精灵新闻！
Today we're doing a report on Traits!
今天，是关于“性情”的报道！
What do they mean? What do they do? Which ones are the best?
性情是什么？有什么用？哪些性情的精灵相对更好呢？
Well...
嗯...
Traits are little parts of a Pokemon's personality that you might discover after spending some time with them.
每只精灵除了外在的性格外，还有更为内敛的性情区分，因此刚刚被捕捉的精灵，是不会立即表露它们的性情的，
Pokemon don't always show their hand as soon as you catch them, you need to bond with them to learn more about them!
训练师们需要与它们建立起更紧密的感情纽带，才能一点点深入地了解它们！
They don't do anything in battle! Any Pokemon can learn to battle just the same!
性情在对战中并没有什么作用，
When it comes to battling, no personality is better than the other!
所有性情的精灵都可以学习各种各样的战斗技巧！
All that matters is finding the right Pokemon for you!
最重要的，是找到与你性情相合的那一只哦！
That's all for today, ciao!
今天就到这里，再见！
Well, this will probably be my last entry here.
这可能是我最后一篇日志了。
Mine's been closed.
矿场已经关闭了。
Permanently, this time. Can't say why.
这1次将是永久关闭，至于原因，我不能说。
Team Chasm has been sending people in and out of the mine every few hours for the last three days.
过去三天里，裂隙队每隔几小时就会派人进入矿区。
It sucks that they're doing this, but they've offered jobs to everyone in the crew.
他们这种做法真的很讨厌，可这份工作又是他们给的。
I wouldn't be allowed to turn down that offer, even if I wanted to.
即便我想拒绝他们，也不能这样做。
Guess I'll have to relocate. Sounds like they'll be putting me somewhere in Southwest Makya.
我估计要搬家了，听说他们会把我安置在马凯亚西南方的某个地方。
Gonna miss little Braden. He's a good kid.
我会想念小布雷登的，他是个好孩子。
Oh, hello there.
哦，你好。
No doubt you can hear my child upstairs, shouting and running around dressed up in that stupid Pikachu costume.
你肯定已经听到了吧，我儿子正穿着傻里傻气的皮卡超服，在楼上大喊大叫，跑来跑去。
He never shuts up about becoming a Pokemon master. Those cartoons must have rotted his brain.
他已经被那些动画片洗脑了，总是嚷着要称为精灵大师。
He needs a reality check. He should find better career paths, like a doctor or lawyer.
该让他清醒清醒了，当个医生或者律师不更好吗？
You look like a competent trainer.
你看起来很厉害。
If you utterly destroy whatever stupid 'team' he's assembled, I'll give you a reward.
如果你能彻底打倒他，我会给你1个奖励。
Have him make a fool of himself, that might set him straight.
让他出进洋相，才有可能改邪归正。
I can still hear his incessant screaming. Please, just stop the kid already.
你听，现在他还在楼下不停地叫，求你了，让这熊孩子安静下来吧！
I'm sure crushing him in a battle will be enough to make him stop.
只要你能在战斗中彻底打倒他，他才能明白什么是现实。
Thank you. Now that his childish dream is done, we can finally get him to sit down and learn something useful.
谢谢你纠正了他那幼稚的想法，这样他就能安静地坐下来学习一些有用的东西了。
Here, take this as payment. I'd offer money to anyone else, but Trainers like these sort of things.
给，这个是你的了。本来想给你些钱的，不过训练师应该更喜欢这个。
One day, that kid will enroll in a college and get a degree that makes some good money.
等那孩子长大，进入大学，拿到1个能赚大钱的学位后，
I'll be proud of him then.
我会为他感到骄傲的。
Traits: Pokemon and You!
性情：精灵与人类！

I've always dreamed of being a Pokemon Trainer! Yesterday I went out and caught some. Now my mom HAS to let me be a trainer!
我一直都想成为一名训练师！昨天我出去抓了一些精灵，现在我妈妈肯定会同意了！
You understand right? If I do well in my first battle, my mom will see what I'm capable of!
你明白我的意思吧？只要我的第一场战斗能够表现出足够的潜力，妈妈就不会再阻止我！
Battle?
来战吧！
You just don't get it.
你根本不懂！
LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!

I'm down but not out. You can't ever put me down.

Be wary of Abilities that grant a Pokemon an immunity they might otherwise not have.
要警惕那些赋予精灵免疫能力的特性。
You might think that a Ground-type attack will knock out your opponant's Eelektross, only to find out that it has Levitate!
不要以为地面属性的攻击可以解决对手的麻麻鳗鱼王，因为它们有漂浮特性！
Abilities that grant resistances, such as Realist and Tough, should also be respected.
像现实主义和坚不可摧这种，可以赋予精灵抗性的特性，都应当重视起来。
I live for trash TV.
我超爱看肥皂剧的。
Last week Kimberly slapped Evan because she caught him reading a romance novel that featured a cycling couple.
上周埃文在读一本自行车情侣的言情小说时被金柏莉发现了，然后就挨了1个响亮的耳光。
They got into a huge fight and ended up breaking all the furniture.
然后他们就大打出手，几乎干碎了所有家具。
Here's the catch -- they aren't even dating. They knew each other for four days.
但是...他们还没有约过会，甚至才认识了4天。
She was jealous because she thought Evan was hinting that she needed to work out more.
金柏莉生气的原因是她觉得埃文在讽刺她缺乏锻炼。
How dramatic!
什么狗血剧情！
Anyways, thanks for letting me share my passion for a bit.
总之，感谢你听我说这么多。
Here's how I enjoy these shows to the max, you should try it too.
这就是我充分享受这些电视剧的方式，你也可以试试。
Trash TV really is the best. Can't wait for the next episode.
肥皂剧真是太好看啦，下一集什么时候播啊！
The TV shows a Dragon-tamer breaking up with a Lady in what seems like a staged moment.
电视上正在播出一位驯龙师和一位女士闹分手的剧情。
If your Pokemon attacks the same target with the same attack, the damage will always be the same!
如果你的精灵以相同的技能，攻击同1个目标，那么伤害将始终一样！
That means that if you're able to crunch the numbers, you can figure out how many attacks it'll take to knock out an opposing Pokemon!
所以你可以计算出需要多少招，才能打倒对方的精灵!
Critical hits are the exception to this, of course.
如果命中要害了另说。
It seems like Ribombee is helping organize the books!
蝶结萌虻正在帮忙整理书籍！
A book called "Gangs of Castelia" lays on the table.
桌上放着一本名叫《卡斯蒂利亚黑帮》的书。
A sticker on the front states that it was adapted into a major motion picture.

Oh hello dearie, you wouldn't happen to be a Trainer would you?
哦，你好，你不会碰巧是训练师吧？
My husband and I have decided to get another Fairy- type friend for our Ribombees and Cutieflies.
我和我的丈夫决定为我们店里的萌虻们，找一只新的妖精属性伙伴。
We managed to go and catch a Milcery, but it's a little too shy for how busy we are.
我们抓了一只小仙奶，但因为没时间照顾它，导致相处得不算很亲密。
If you have another Fairy-type, I think it'd be nice to have a little trade.
如果你有另一只妖精属性精灵，那我觉得来1次小小交换也很不错（可在箱子里选择精灵）。
Oh, alright. You tell me if you change your mind now.
哦，好吧。如果你改变主意了再告诉我。
Come back if you can find a Fairy-type!
你找到妖精属性精灵后再来吧!
Oh this little one is perfect, I'm sure our regulars will love it.
哦，这小家伙简直完美，我相信我们的常客会喜欢它的。
Thank you dear, people will be excited to meet the new face here.
谢谢你，大家肯定会喜欢这个新面孔的。
Things are going well dear, your Pokemon has been quite the hit with our customers.
 一切都很顺利，你的精灵很受我们顾客的欢迎。
Take care of the old mascot dear, I'm sure it hates being cooped up in a place like this.
另外还请你照顾好那只小仙奶，或许它只是不喜欢被关在这里吧。

I hate reading. I don't even know why I come here.
我讨厌读书...我都不知道为什么会来这里。
The coffee isn't even that great...
咖啡也不怎么好喝...
I have a younger brother who is very, very dense.
我弟弟真是太太太太奇怪了。
He's obsessed with water and the ocean. And especially with making metaphors about them.
他脑子里全是水啊，海啊之类的东西，并且总喜欢拿这些做比喻。
He constantly talks about super weird stuff like "darkness" and "crushing pressure".
还老是讲一些很怪的东西，比如“黑暗”“压强”什么的。
I'm not gonna rain on his parade. It's just really weird that --
我不想扫他的兴。只是很奇怪——
...
...
Did I just use a water metaphor? Ugh, maybe it's rubbing off on me...
我刚刚是不是也用了水的比喻？我也要变奇怪了吗...
Hundreds of comic books, magazines, and graphic novels line the shelves.

But my shortcut there, the Gigalith's Guts, has a bunch of Avatars now.
但是现在怪岩肠道里有很多的化身，这条捷径已经没法走了。
It stinks!
好烦！
Many Trainers starting their Gym Challenge know that Burn can reduce an enemy Pokemon's Attack.
很多训练师都知道。烧伤可以减小对手的攻击。
But some Trainers still don't know that Frostbite reduces an enemy's Special Attack.
但是有些训练师还不知道，冻伤会减小对手的特攻。
On top of this, Numb reduces all of a Pokemon's damage while being coupled with a Speed reduction.
此外，还有麻痹这个状态，不只是减小精灵的速度，还能减小它所造成的所有伤害。
While it might be appealing to utilize Numb's flexibility, the specialized effects of Frostbite and Burn are stronger than that of Numb's.
虽说麻痹的效果听起来厉害，但冻伤和烧伤的针对性更好。
Hey, interested in the Novo Battling Club?
嘿，对望新对战俱乐部有兴趣吗？
If you haven't met him already, you can speak with Louis to participate in the battles.
如果你有兴趣的话，可以去找路易斯谈谈。
Otherwise, take this, courtesy of the Café.
无论你的答复为何，都请收下咖啡厅的心意。
Use that cookie to heal your Pokemon of any status condition -- even those that are Dizzy or Leeched!
使用这块饼干可以恢复你精灵的异常状态 - 其中包括混乱和寄生！
Dizzy and Leech both have their uses, though some cases are better than others!
混乱和寄生都有各自的用处，在某些情况下起到逆转战局的效果！
Dizzy Pokemon have their abilities surpressed and take extra damage!
混乱状态下精灵会失去其特性，还将受到更高的伤害！
Leeched Pokemon have their health stolen by their opponent! In a double battle, the healing is split between both opponents.
而处于寄生状态的精灵将会被吸走自身的HP！如果是双打对战，这部分HP会平均分给2个对手。
The atmosphere here is nice.
这里的氛围很好。
I should really come more often.
我真该多来几次。

利欧路好像想拿一本书，但以它的身高根本够不到。
Do you want to help the Pokemon?

但是，谁知道这里的真相呢？

I’ll admit it: I’m curious. What do you bring to the table that no other challenger does?
我承认，我很好奇。你身上有哪些其他挑战者所没有的点？
No matter what praise Tamarind or the others heap upon you, don’t let it go to your head.
无论塔玛琳或者其他人对你的评价有多高，也不要被赞誉冲昏头脑。
I’m rather more rigorous in my analyses.

我很愿意与你再来一场决斗，这对我来说也很有帮助。
I’ll make the time, whenever you want to give me yours. Good day, \PN.
只要你想，我随时能抽出时间，祝你好运，\PN。
A screensaver image of a Luxray bounces lazily around the screen.
伦琴猫的屏保在屏幕上跳来跳去。
Yo, champ in the making!
你好，未来的冠军！
Helena runs a tight ship around here.
海伦娜对这里的管理非常严格。
Even I can't get away with just standing around all day!
就算是我也不能整天站着做招待！
Helena understands that efficiency comes from information, and information from the flow of communication.
她的理念是“效率来源于情报，情报来源于沟通与流动。”
That's why she's focused her gym around Electric-type and Water-type Pokemon!
因此，作为她的道馆，这里专精的也是电属性和水属性精灵！
They're a strong pair in battles, sharing no weaknesses.
这是两种配合起来很强力的属性，它们没有共同的弱点。
Firstly, Grass-type Pokemon are your best bet against her, since they're strong against Water- types, and resist Electric.
草属性精灵一定是最优选，既能克制水属性，也能抵抗电属性。
Secondarily, Dragon-type Pokemon will resist both Water and Electric.
再就是龙属性，可以同时抵抗水属性和电属性攻击。
Finally, mirroring her with Electric-type Pokemon of your own can work well too.
再有，如果你也使用电属性，或许也能很好地反制她。
They're strong against Water-types, and resist Electric.
在某些情况下，电属性也能起到与草属性差不多的作用。
Hope that helps!
希望这些对你有用！
You out-maneuvered Team Chasm's best strategist!
你靠着策略打倒了裂隙队最强的战术家！
Congratulations, I hope you feel good about that one!
恭喜啊，希望你能好好享受此刻的心情！
We were initially hesitant to partake in constructing gyms, but we chose to do so for two reasons.
我们一开始对是否建造这座道馆有些犹豫，但考虑到两点还是这样做了。
Firstly, it provided legitimacy.
第一，是为了合法性。
Secondly, it allowed us to find exceptional trainers such as yourself.
第二，是为了能够遇到一些，像你这样优秀的训练师。
I would like you to take this key, with the understanding that through the door it unlocks is a particularly dangerous avatar.
我希望你能拿上这把钥匙，同时你也要清楚地意识到，门后面是1个格外危险的化身。
Obliterate it. Show me that our search is over.
只要将它消灭掉，这里的危机就解除了。
You'll find the problem at the north wall of Team Chasm HQ. Well, former HQ.
你可以在裂隙队前总部的北墙上找到一扇那种特殊的门，记住，是前总部。
The avatar still exists. I’m patient, but I would be lying if I said I didn’t yearn for the day it was gone.
这个化身不会脱困的，虽然我有耐心，但也想尽快消灭它。
It is my most-despised responsibility.
我很讨厌这种责任。
Search the north wall of Team Chasm HQ.
记得去查看裂隙队前总部的北墙。
It’s gone?
把它消灭了？
I never thought I’d share Andris’s joy in seeing a problem -- how would he put it? -- deep-sixed, but this does feel good.
没想到我会跟安德里斯一样，在问题解决时感到这么兴奋...用他的话怎么说来着？啊，终于搞定了，舒畅！
Thank you. That’s a weight off of my shoulders, not to mention proof my idea worked.
谢谢你让我卸掉了身上的负担，同时证明了我想法的可行性。
Good day, \PN.
祝你好运，\PN。
And thank you.
谢谢。
Oh... good. You.
哦！哦...是你。
I’m going to be honest: I’m not really a fan.
实话实说，我并不是很想看到你。
Oh, don’t take it personally. I don’t like anyone around here.
别想太多，我只是讨厌这里的一切罢了。
As soon as I’ve got my fortune, I’m leaving this damned region behind.
等我攒了足够的钱，就会离开这个该死的地方。
I’m going to live on a megayacht in the warm Alolan waters, writing semi-autobiographical erotica under a penname.
我打算隐居在温暖的阿罗拉，在附近买一艘游艇做住所，取个笔名写写半自传体的小黄书。
And I never have to think about any of you ever again.
这样我就不用想起包括你在内的，这里的所有人了。
Well, maybe I’ll invite Tamarind. Just to rub it in her face, of course. Of course...
呃...或许我会写塔玛琳？当然，她必然是丑角，必然...
Not yet.
稍等
Let's.
来吧

在此停下。
Your Pokemon are now healed.
你的精灵已经痊愈。

[Map25]
Presenting, my very own Normal-type attack!
介绍一下，这是我的独创的一般属性技能！
Is it Physical, you ask? Special, perhaps? It's both, of course!
物理还是特殊？那当然两者都有！
Your Pokemon uses whichever is best for their stats!
适应之力听说过吗？这招会根据精灵的能力值以更高伤害的形态出击！
Is there a catch, hmmm? ...Yes...the move misses 30 percent of the time.
有没有什么副作用？嗯...有，失手的概率略高一点。
Whaddya say? Nearly every Normal-type Pokemon can be taught this move, and even a few others.
你觉得怎么样？几乎每只一般属性的精灵都可以学会这个技能，某些别的精灵也能学。
Truly you've struck the motherload of moves!
你可是学到了一项前所未有的神技！
Fine... I just wanted something to do now that the mine's closed...
好吧...现在矿场关了，我只是想找点事情做罢了。
What're you doing?!
你在干什么？
You're \PN, right? The trainer the Professor called in?
你是\PN，对吧？博士叫来的训练师？
So go destroy that Avatar before we're all killed!
那就在大家被杀死前，干掉那个化身吧！
I used to use a lot of Life Orbs. Didn't care if my Pokemon got hurt so long as they did the work.
我以前只在乎能否完成任务，不在意精灵们是否会受伤，所以经常使用生命宝珠。
But I'm not that kind of person any more. I'm looking to rid myself of them.
但我现在变了，我不想再那样做了。
I've just got one left. I'll sell it to you for $6,000. Fair market value.
我只有1个了。6000金钱卖给你，市场价。
Sounds good. I'll be on patrol for awhile now, so hit me up if you change your mind.
好的，如果你改变主意了，可以再联系我。我现在要进行巡逻了。
Here ya go, pleasure doing business.
很高兴能与你达成这笔交易。
\PN hands over $6000 in exchange.
\PN递出了6000金钱作为交换。
Guess I'll go back on patrol now.
我要回去巡逻了。
Looks like you're a bit short on cash.
看来你手头有点紧啊。
I get that, wasn't in the best financial spot myself before I joined Chasm.
我能理解，在加入裂隙队之前我也没啥钱。
Despite their pain, my team still loves battling.
曾经我的精灵们都生活地很痛苦，但它们依然在奋力战斗着。
To be honest, I don't deserve their forgiveness. I hurt them, but they still forgave me.
说实话，我不值得它们宽恕，我伤害了它们，但它们还是选择原谅我。
I get a bit emotional everytime I think about it, haha.
每次想起这些都有点感慨，哈哈。

My my, I hope you aren't here to battle. I won't be able to tell my Pokemon anything if you keep taking my breath away.
你不会是来找我战斗的吧！连个喘气的时间都不给，我还怎么跟精灵们培养感情。
Oh, you are? Ah, I suppose a rose as pretty as you would have some very sharp thorns...
你的确是为了战斗而来吗？好吧，但要小心哦，漂亮的玫瑰都有着锐利的尖刺...
I laid out each of these starter tokens to maybe attract someone suitable... for battle.
我在这里留下了三枚代币，来作为对战的奖励。
Perhaps you'll be able to satisfy both criteria...
就看你能不能达成我的条件了...
The top of the sign is labeled "Grouz Mine Bulletin."
最上面一层是“古治矿场公告。”
Remnants of old, yellowed papers are still stapled to the rest.
边边角角处还能看到一些老旧发黄的残留碎纸片。
What a disgrace.
真丢人。
We're supposed to be keeping this area safe.
我们应该保护这里的安全的。
A call for you, Trainer.
你的电话，训练师。
The ranger hands you a cell phone.
护林员成员将手机递给你。
Heard a certain metal worm is no longer with us. You won’t see me at the funeral.
听说某条金属虫子已经被解决了？它的葬礼我就不出席了。
Anyways, I’m a woman of my word – I’ll be your friend in high places.
总之，我是个言而有信的人，我会以我的身份给你些帮助。
I’m holed up in <imp>Helena’s place</imp>, west of the LuxTech eyesore.
我现在在<imp>海伦娜的地盘</imp>，从碍眼的光华市往西走。
North-west of the lake, can’t miss it.
这里的东南方向有个湖，应该挺好找的。
Oh, and bring your team. I invited another guest.
对了，带上你的精灵队伍，我还邀请了另外1个客人。
Ah, where were you in the good ol’ days? You would’ve made a great grunt!
啊，为什么那时候你不在这里。你一定是1个优秀的士兵！
...That’s a compliment, by the way. See ya there.
...听不懂无所谓，总之是句夸奖，到时再见。
You gotta keep sharp! Don’t tell me you’re sick of fights.
保持敏锐和警惕，别告诉我你已经厌倦对战了。
Our guest’s pretty good, too. She might teach you a thing or two.
这个客人可是不可多得的，或许她还能教你两招。
Well, see ya.
到时再见。
You think I’M bad? Try working with Helena for a few years. Especially back when she had strike teams at her disposal.
你觉得我很难相处？试着跟海伦娜公事几年吧，尤其是她手下有军队的时候。
You’re strong. You’ve proven that. This’ll be a piece of cake. Trust me. So I’ll see ya there.
你已经证明了自身的实力，我觉得这场战斗对你来说不过小菜一碟，到时候见。
…She hung up.
...她挂断了。
Thanks for the help.
谢谢。

The door is boarded up.
这扇门被木板封死了。
Hello, \PN. It’s been quite some time!
你好，\PN，好久不见!
Though I’ve heard tales of someone that looked like you talking to someone that looked like me by a certain river that I know a certain Ditto appreciates.
我听说有人看到2个长得很像我们的人，在那只百变怪经常出没的河边聊天。
Well, I say that, but I suppose I’ve never verified that she is, in fact, a Ditto.
嗯，说归说，但我还没确定她到底是不是百变怪。
I have never seen her un-transformed, specifically.
我并没见过她的原形。
I have tried tossing a Poké Ball at her, with no effect other than a withering glower.
之前朝她扔精灵球，除了得到了1个鄙视的眼神外，没有任何效果。
She could be anything, I suppose, but what else can take human form for so long with such accuracy?
理论上讲她可以是任何生物，但除了百变怪外，还有什么能像她这样维持这么久的人形态？
A particularly persistent and vocal Zoroark? Perhaps some other Pokémon that learns Transform?
一只能长时间维持变身且会说人话的索罗亚克？还是其他会变身技能的精灵？
Or perhaps she really is simply a doppelganger of eldritch origin, or a spirit haunting me for some forgotten transgression.
还是说她真的是来自另1个世界的我？又或是某个因为我的过错而一直纠缠不休的鬼魂？
The one that gave you that amulet – not that it matters.
因为我给了你那个护身符...算了这不重要。
Don’t worry, I don’t take any offense! My doppelganger and I are more alike than we are different.
放心，我不会因为这而生气，毕竟大家分不清也实属正常。
How, precisely, would a Ditto learn to imitate my manners with such care...?
不过...百变怪又是怎么模仿我的行为举止的呢？
I suppose it bears little tangible relevance to my situation, though.
讨论这些对我现在的处境并没有实质性的意义。
Oh, I’m sorry I’m such a glum philosopher archetype.
抱歉，我是不是表现得太沉闷了？
If I must play a stock role in your story, I would prefer to be an oracle distributing wisdom, or a magical creature bestowing some blessing or artifact.
如果我真的要在你的故事中扮演一名角色，我更愿意做散播智慧的先知，或是赐予祝福的精灵。
I hope you’re not expecting any wisdom or artifacts from me.
当然，希望你不要指望我真能提供什么智慧或祝福。
I fear I’m far too invested in my own quest for self- discovery to aid you in yours.
我怕自身过于投入在自身的探求中而忽略了对你的帮助。
...Oh, that isn’t true. I can’t maintain a charade of indifference half as well as my companion. I am rather invested in you and yours.
不过实际上，这种可能不大，我对你的事情很感兴趣，没办法像她那样故作冷漠。
Thank you.
谢谢。
I could easily take the simple explanation afforded to all diviners: that I am interested in you because I have foretold some matter of interest in your future.
我只能简单地告诉你：我预见了一些你未来会遇到的事。
Unfortunately, I am insufferably honest, so I must confess that I simply enjoy your company.
可惜，我实在不擅长撒谎，其实我只是喜欢与你一起的时光。
Indeed. You are plainly at the center of a whorl of causality here – it takes no arcana to determine that.
你现身处于因果漩涡之中，即便我不借助占卜也能看得出来。
I cannot ascertain the future with any degree of certainty, but I can plainly see which way the river cuts.
虽说我无法确定未来的结果，但能清楚地看到事物的发展趋势。
I would like to liberate its path of hindrances if possible.
要是可能的话，我会试着扫平前方的阻碍。
Oh! Excuse me, I refer merely to my interest in seeing your rather unique path through fate’s weave come to pass.
啊！不好意思，我只是想见识一下你独特的命格。
Well, that and a respectable appreciation for the quality of your character and company.
再就是我对你自身个性与品格欣赏。
It was not my intent to imply an interest in an... assignation, if that was what you were asking. Such passions are not my lot in life.
我没有在暗示...感情方面，我的人生也不会有这种强烈的感情。
Consider it a professional curiosity, if that might ease your concerns... or insecurities.
如果我说这只是职业上的好奇...能缓解你的焦虑和不安吗？
You are of note not merely for your personality and character –
不仅只是因为你的个性与品格...
though I confess some partiality to both – but for the briar-knot of fate you are embedded within.
我承认我的确喜欢你的这些性情...但关注你更多是因为你正深陷在命运的泥潭之中。
Many lives are wound around you. Around your fingers, or your throat, I wonder?
许多生命正与你紧密连结在一起，究竟是被你握于手中呢，还是紧紧地扼住了你的喉咙呢？
Put plainly, you’re important, I’m curious, and I like our conversations.
简单来讲就是 - 你很重要！而我，对你这份重要感到好奇，再就是我也很喜欢与你交流。
Even the ones I am not privy to I imagine are enlightening for my other half, and her revelations may lead to my own.
即便是命运中无法得知的细节，也会作为对她的启示而存在，我也可以在其中参悟良多。
Speaking of which, I am not merely here for pleasure. I had returned home for the express purpose of finding some clue as to my past.
其实，我到这里，并不是来旅行的。大部分内容，我都记不起来了，只知道这里是我的故乡...
I... cannot remember it. That this is my hometown, yes, and stray faint recollections from my youth, but beyond that nothing.
我只保留着一段模糊的，青年时期的回忆，而我回来这里，就是为了找寻关于我过去的线索。
Not until a comparatively luminous memory of riding on a train with my imitator at my side.
直到在来这边的火车上与我的模仿者并肩而坐时，我才想起一段相对清晰的记忆。
Whatever had happened before that leg of our journey, I do not remember.
但在这段旅程之外的内容，依然是一片空白。
I only know that I am real, she is false, and I journey to prove such.
我只知道我是真的，她是假的，我接下来的旅程，也是为了证明这一点。
Not at all. But I must keep the faith.
没有任何证据，但我必须坚持这个信念。
After all, if I am merely some animal that has deluded itself into humanity... well, the ethical quandaries alone would drive me mad.
毕竟，如果我只是某种...把自身视为人类的动物...单是伦理问题就能把我逼疯。
Oh, plenty. Scraps of childhood, as I said. Being on the train is the first full memory of my modern era.
就像我之前说的那样，有一些关于青年时期的零散片段，而火车上的相遇是第一段完整的记忆。
And from there, my memory is mostly whole – though the persistence and clarity of memory is something ethereal and unquantifiable.
从那之后我的记忆就基本正常了，当然，这只是我自身的感觉，我也不确定其他人的记忆是不是更稳定、清晰。
Perhaps mine are fragmented and faded compared to most.
毕竟我们永远都没办法对此做出准确的比较。
She likes to elude me, and, though I am loathe to admit it, I her.
她总喜欢躲着我，虽然我不愿承认，但我也躲着她。
It is rare we get more than a fleeting moment alone. Things are now... different, however.
我们很少会单独待在一起，不过，现在...或许不一样了。
Being here has driven my thoughts to doubt and darker places than that. I have found now answers.
来到这里之后，我的思维就在怀疑之中，逐渐被引导进更为黑暗的地方，并找到了现在这些答案。
The other Imogene has already left, unable to bear it any longer.
而另1个伊莫珍受不了这些，便选择离开这里。
She left a note stating simply that she knew what she must do, and that she goes now to a place of death and quiet oblivion.
她留下了一张写着去处的便条 - 去1个死亡之地，静静地等待被人遗忘。
I choose to interpret it as guidance to find a <imp>burial ground or mausoleum</imp>, and not as her last goodbyes...
我觉得她是打算前往<imp>类似墓地的地方</imp>，并不是做最后的告别...
I’m unsure if there is a difference for us.
我...我不确定我们到底有多少不同。
\PN… I don’t know that we should exist.
\PN...我甚至不知道我们是否应该存在。
There is something fundamentally wrong with us. Our state is not natural, nor is it tenable.
我们的本质存在着根本性的问题，我们的状态既不自然，也难以为继。
...Ignore my macabre ramblings.
...别在意我的胡言乱语。
I will follow her, and find the proof of my true existence.
我会跟着她，找出我是真实存在的那个的证据。
If you wish to bear witness to these revelations and watch as her lies crumble around her, come find us.
她知道的比我更多，所以我必须要弄清楚！
She knows something dire that I do not. I must know what it is.
如果你想亲眼目睹真相，看到她的谎言四散瓦解，那就来找我们吧。
I'm trying to figure out why certain Avatars appear where they do.
我一直尝试着弄明白，为什么那些化身会出现在这里。
They're often species that'd make sense for the local ecology, but not always.
它们看起来都是正常的物种，当然也不能这么说。
Sometimes they're just.... somewhat off.
有时候它们只是...有些小变化。
Beats me.
想不明白。
I heard the stories, but it's still hard to believe that Avatars just... fade from existence when they're defeated.
虽然之前听别人说过，但我还是很难相信，化身在被打倒后就会消失。
When I saw that you were winning, I was mentally prepared to grab a pickaxe and begin the cleanup efforts.
看到你取得胜利之后，我就做好重新回到岗位上的准备了。
Ohoh, does another fly enter my trap?
哦，又有猎物飞进我的陷阱了？
Watch yourself, you may find yourself mesmerized.
小心，不要入迷了哦。
Tsk! It seems like you were too hot to handle.
啧啧，已经热得有点受不了了。
Ah well, I suppose I could always ask Lainie to console me.
啊，我需要兰妮的安慰。
A spark. A flash. A line of roses.
旋转，跳跃，我闭着眼。
We should take our tango once more from the top.
或许我们应该再舞一曲。
But later, my dear.
但不是现在，亲爱的。
I've found myself as a bit of a historian.
我算是1个历史研究者吧。
I'm learning about important dates in history. The founding of Prizca, the fall of the monarchy.
我正在学习和研究这里的史诗，比如宏礼市的建立、王朝的陨落。
All of them are fascinating, but I believe my favorite is the one we'll have, no?
历史有着独特的魅力，但我还是更喜欢即将拥有的未来，你呢？
I wanted to be a Water-type trainer before, but now I don't.
我之前想成为一名水属性训练师，但现在我改主意了。
That's because I caught this Tentacool. It's super dumb. It's so dumb that I quit being a Trainer.
就因为我抓到的这只玛瑙水母，它真是...蠢到我连训练师都不想当了。
Maybe I'll want to be a Trainer again if I see a cool Water-type Pokemon, but if any Pokemon is as dumb as this Tentacool, I might die.
如果我能得到很酷的水属性精灵，或许还会重燃梦想，但要是跟这玛瑙水母一样蠢，我可能刚进草丛就要死翘翘了。
Do you have a cool Water-type Pokemon that you could show me?
你有很酷的水属性精灵吗？可以给我看看吗？
I'll give you my dumb Pokemon if you do.
只要你给我看看，我就把这只水母送你了。
That's cool, maybe.
好的，我就稍微抱有一丝希望吧。
Oh. That's dumb. You are dumb.
呃，什么蠢东西...跟你看起来一样蠢！
Wow. That Water-type is pretty cool.
哇，这只水属性精灵也太酷了！
I still don't want to be a Trainer anymore.
但我还是不想当训练师。
Take this dumb Tentacool because I don't want to see or think or hear or touch it again.
把这只蠢货水母带走吧，我再也不想看到、想到、听到或者触摸到它了。
It is your dumb problem now.
现在这是你的蠢货了。
Ok. I'll keep holding on to this dumb Pokemon.
好吧，就让我继续跟这个蠢货待在一起吧。
Yeah.
好耶！解脱了！
Yes

No thanks.
不买
Sure, I'll pay.
要了

我也不能忽视你
Oh?
哦？
In... what way?

Please don't be.
别别别

Nevermind. Kid, I need some help.
小家伙，我需要协助。
That thing needs to go down, and I’m fresh out of Pokémon.
我们必须赶快解决那东西，但我已经没有可以出战的精灵了。
Please. We can’t let it escape.
交给你了，绝不能让它跑掉。
Don’t underestimate it.
还有，不要轻敌！
You'll need to send out <imp>two Pokemon at a time</imp> to even stand a chance.
只有<imp>同时派出两只精灵</imp>，才有打倒它的机会。
I don’t have anything left. This is all on you.
我现在帮不上什么忙，只能靠你了。
I can’t thank you enough. Honest.
真是非常感谢。
That thing was what we’re calling an <imp>Avatar</imp>.
那东西就是我们所说的<imp>化身</imp>。
They started showing up a few months back.
几个月前，它们突然出现在野外...
It's rare to find a trainer that can take one on in a straight-up fight.
只有很少一部分训练师有实力与它们正面相持。
I heard one showed up in here and figured I had to do something before it hurt anyone, but I got cocky.
之前听说有这里一只化身，便打算在它伤人前消灭它，但我的准备没有做足...
Lemme heal your Pokemon.
让我帮忙治疗你的精灵吧。
Anyways, the name’s Lambert.
还有，我叫兰伯特。
I’ve got a feeling I’ll see you around the gym sometime soon, yeah?
想必我很快就会在道馆见到你了，对吧？

I caught a Meowth during my tour to Galar, to build my cat collection.
我在去伽勒尔地区旅游时捕捉了一只喵喵，用来丰富我的猫咪收藏。
It's far more trouble than it's worth. It keeps getting into fights with my other cats.

I've been thinking of adopting a new Pokemon. Another cat.
我一直在考虑领养一只新的精灵，收集另一只猫咪。
If you happen to have one, I'll trade you for this Galarian Meowth.
如果你正好有一只，我可以用这只伽勒尔喵喵跟你换。
Ah well. I guess I'll have to try finding a new owner online.
唉，看来我得试着在网上给它找个新主人了。

You really are incredible! I'm bummed out after taking a stomping like that.
你真的很厉害，都要把我的自信给打没了！
Seems like I bit off more than I could chew, but that isn't anything new. I'm off to find somewhere else to shack up.
或许我不该把自身逼得这么紧？管他的，是时候前往下一站了。
A promise is a promise, have a grab at my loot. I'm down to rematch if you swing by again.
一言既出驷马难追，如果你想要获得更多奖励，那就准备好后再来一场吧！
Don't think you've impressed me yet. I've still got a bone to pick with your team.
你虽然赢了，但还不够，继续让你的队伍变得更强吧。
I just got a MasterDex. I can't wait to use it during battles, it seems very helpful!
我刚刚得到了大师图鉴，已经迫不及待要在战斗中试用了，它一定能给我提供很多帮助！
Crushed underfoot...
我被虐得好惨...
I can't catch a break...
我总是碰壁啊...
Come back tomorrow, I might have more energy then...
明天再来吧，明天我可能会更有精神...
Name's Xander.
我是桑德尔。
I'm a professional trainer, trying to scrap together a team for this year's championships.
一名精英训练师，正在这里准备参加联盟赛的精灵。
Nothing attracts the Vullabies like fresh meat, so I'm offering a reward for beating me: An Eevee.
如果你能打败我的秃鹰丫头们，我还会给你1个特别的奖励。
On top of that, an Eevee Ticket from my stash of 'em. Redeemable in the stinkin' big city up north.

However, it won't be easy, as I have a <imp>full 6 Pokemon team</imp>.

Hey kid! I'm looking to collect some birds!
嘿，小家伙，能帮帮我吗？
I've been trying to find a Pidgey on this route, but I'm starting to think that there might not be any here.
我正在寻找一种叫波波的精灵，但我只知道这座岛上有...
They must be somewhere on this island, I can just feel it!
在这附近转了好久了，一只都没能遇到！
If I had my <imp>MasterDex</imp> with me, I'd be able to find the exact spots where Pidgey gather.
可惜我没带<imp>大师图鉴</imp>，不然就能查看它们的栖息地了。
If you can find one for me, I'll trade you this Pidove.
你能帮我找一只吗？我可以用这只豆豆鸽跟你换。
Back to searching then!
那我自身慢慢找吧！
I just know there's got to be one somewhere on this island!

My collection grows!

Hello, welcome to Novo Apartments.
你好，欢迎来到望新公寓。
We have no vacancies at the moment, unfortunately.
但很抱歉，现在没有空房了。
My parents were really excited for my first Pokemon. They gave me a few Pokeballs and sent me on my way.
当我爸爸妈妈得知我即将拥有第一只精灵时，都非常非常高兴，还给了我好几个精灵球。
But they were expecting me to get a Buneary or a Yamper or something, not a Vulpix.
但他们希望我得到的是卷卷耳或者来电汪之类的精灵，而不是六尾。
Apparently the Vulpix in this region are really mean. But not this one though, it's really nice!
听说这个地区的六尾好像都很坏...但是这只不同，它很友好！
Even if it's nice, my parents aren't letting me keep it...
可就算是这样，爸爸妈妈也不让我留着它...
Can you trade me for a Buneary or a Yamper? I want a Pokemon my parents are happy with.
你愿意用一只卷卷耳或来电汪和我交换吗？我想要换一只能让我爸爸妈妈满意的精灵（可在箱子里选择精灵）。
I don't want to just release this Pokemon into the wild...
我不想把它放生...
This Vulpix needs a good home! I'll be here if you change your mind!
这只六尾需要1个温馨的家！我会在这里给它找1个好的主人！

Thanks, now I have a Pokemon my parents will be happy with.

嘿，你是个训练师对吧？拜托我，我需要你的帮助。
My Growlithe got spooked when I was taking it for a walk.

He ran off, and I wasn't able to find him again.

He's lost somewhere in Repora Forest.
他有可能在枯槁森林里迷路了。
Please find him, we've been together our entire lives.

没错，总有一天，我会变得像你这样强大，有能力去帮助别人。
Maybe the Rangers that are stationed here will help me get stronger!
或许我可以找这里的护林员帮忙，他们应该有办法让我变强！
They fought tons of battles back when Team Chasm was around. They must be total vets!
裂隙队还在的时候，他们打了无数场仗，个个都是战斗好手！

Lots of Pokemon that live in the sewers help with waste treatment.
许多生活在下水道中的精灵都可以协助分解废料。
Too many Pokemon though, and the ecosystem might collapse.
但如果它们的数量过多的话，生态系统就有崩溃的风险。
We try to divert some waste to other places if we get too much of an influx.
所以我们会试着将一些废料转移到其他地方。
That way the population stays steady.
这样就能维持种群数量的稳定了。
I like to spend time here instead of the breakroom.
相比于休息室，我更喜欢呆在这里。
It's a lot quieter.

你看到我身后那些自行车了吗？它们是马凯亚最好的车。
I've been attending the festival every year since it was founded!

The Trainers here get better every year...
是这里的训练师一直在进步...
Or am I losing my edge?
还是我的实力减小了?
My my, you're a special one. Have you considered entering into the Tournament?
天啊，你很特别，考虑过参加锦标赛吗?
The Trainers this year are so intense.

This person is too focused on watching the battle to notice you.

I wanna be one someday!

Whoa whoa whoa there! You can't just stroll up to The Bench like that.
喂喂喂！你不能坐这把长椅！
This is The Bench, haven't ya heard? It's only got room for one winner, and that winner... is me.
你没听说过？这把长椅是属于这里的胜者的，而这个胜者...就是我！
Now I know that The Bench might be a bit intimidating for ya, so I've sweetened up the competition with a nice little relic I found.
我知道这长椅对你们来说，有很强的吸引力，更别说我还添加了一下小奖励。
Heard it goes for a pretty penny, so it might be worth taking me on. Wanna go at it?
看起来价格不菲哦，你就不想试试吗？
I've been stationed here to help in case of injury.
我被派到这里是为了防止有人受伤。
Oh, I'm finally getting paged!

在宏礼市中心的这个广场，与来自各地的训练师决一胜负。
Nobody, not me, not locals, not tourists, wants to stop battling.
无论是我，还是其他参赛者，没有人想要就此止步。
Excellent shots. Check online in a few days, you might have just battled in front of a few million viewers.
这个镜头真不错，过几天去网上看看，说不定你就火了！
We have some good footage, but lets stick around to make a B-Roll.
虽然我们已经拍了一些很棒的镜头，但还是再多补拍一些吧。
Professional Trainers from around the world are gathering here.
来自世界各地的精英训练师汇聚于此。
I'm technically a bit early, but it's worth it to see the best Makya has to offer.
虽然我来得早了些，但能看到马凯亚最好的一面还是很值得的。
I'm a former Makyan Tournament Champion.
我曾是马凯亚大赛的冠军。
No no, not in my youth--the festival has only been going on for eight years!
不，我不是说年轻的时候...这个节日庆典才举办了八年!
You never know when you'll reach your prime.
你永远不知道什么时候是你的巅峰状态。
Anyways, name's Ansel.
忘了介绍，我叫安塞尔。
It's just a hunch, but you seem like a Trainer that's looking for a good fight.
我感觉你很想来一场酣畅淋漓的对战。
You might want to check in on the other Champions.
那你应该去周围逛逛。
There's a few of us here in town.
这座城市除了我之外还有几位前任冠军。
Scilla's at the Ironclad Dojo, and Elise is always holed up in the Castle...
希拉在钢铁道场，而伊莉丝一般都在城堡里...
Tell you what. If you manage to beat one of them in battle, I'll bring my team out of retirement for one last fight.
这样说吧，如果你能打败其中一人，那我就会叫回我退休的队伍，与你一决胜负。
Until then, enjoy your journey! You only get to do it once.
在那之前，好好享受你的旅程吧！你只有1次机会。
You might want to check in on the other Former Champions. There's a few of us here in town.
如果你对其他前冠军感兴趣的话，可以在这座城市找找看。
Scilla's at the Ironclad Dojo, and Elise is always holed up by the Castle...
希拉一般在钢铁道场，而伊莉丝则通常在城堡里...
If you manage to beat one of them in battle, I'll bring my team out of retirement for one last fight.
如果你打败其中任意一人，我就会召回我的队伍，与你一决胜负。
I've heard the news. A Trainer beating any of the Former Champions makes waves in our circles.
我听说了，打败任何一位前冠军在我们的圈子里都会引起轰动。
I've got a promise to keep, \PN. Got my team back from a cushy retirement -- no small task!
我有个承诺要兑现，\PN。我让我的队伍从舒适的退休生活中回归了——这可不是件轻松的事！
Wouldn't want to keep them waiting for too long. Fancy to give us one last skirmish?
我不想让它们等太久，愿意与我们一决胜负吗？
I'm as antsy as a Durant. Get ready soon!
我跟杜兰特一样没什么耐心，快快准备好！
Then let's waste no time. Ready yourself!
那我们就别浪费时间了！
Ha! Haha! What a rush!
哈哈！太畅快了！
Two years of sitting on my bum would do that! I think my whole team is gonna feel sore tomorrow!
两年没训练输了也是正常！我感觉我的老伙计们明天都得腰酸背痛了！
You've done well, \PN. Any longer and I might have needed to call it quits early. Don't handle adrenaline well in my old age.
打的真不错，\PN。要是再打久点，可能就得中间叫暂停了，我年纪摆在这里，心脏受不了。
I'm sure you're not satisfied just a single battle from me, but that's all I got in me. Retirement's just a little too comfy!
我知道你还想多打几场，但我只能奉陪到此，毕竟退休生活实在是太安逸了！
Let me make up for it. I'll ask Praveen to take my place.
不过作为补偿，就让普拉文替吧。
Child's got no respect for elders, but he's not a bad battler.
那小子虽说不尊重长辈，但他打得还不赖。
He'll probably be training in the Sandstone Estuary. No doubt he'll stop whatever he's doing to face you.
他现在可能在沙岩河口训练，不过你放心，有架打的话，他肯定会立即停下手头的事。
In the meantime, I need a nap. Farewell!

You get to see all sorts of battle strategies and team compositions.
在这里能看到各种各样的队伍组合和战斗策略。
There's always something to learn.
总有能学到的东西。
I have more Flying-type Pokemon, but I left them back at home so I could diversify!
我有很多的飞行属性精灵，但我把它们都留在家里了，这样增加我队伍的多元性！
Actually, I should stick to types that I know...
或许，我应该坚持使用自身熟悉的属性...
Maybe I need to find even more types!
也许我需要收集更多其他属性的精灵！
Should I branch out into Electric-type? Fire-type?
电还是火呢？
The Tournament has been growing in size and prestige every year.
战斗节庆典的规模和声势每年都在增加。
Makyans have been battling here ever since Trainers became a thing.
自从训练师这种职业出现，马凯亚人就一直在这里战斗。
However, it got seriously large and respected once LuxTech started pumped in a bunch of sponsor money.
当然那时候还没有庆典这一说，声势和规模，自然是光华科技参与之后，逐年打上去的。
Wow, a wallhacker! #content
哇哦，穿墙哥！ #content
Any non-Trainers who walk through this Plaza, by accident of course, is in for a shock once they realize where they are.
任何非训练师误入这个广场，一旦意识到自身在哪儿，肯定会大吃一惊。
Most Pokemon who wander through here are caught by Trainers unless they were already part of another Trainer's party.
如果是野生精灵出现在这里，那它很快就会被抓住。

You experienced a hollow victory. Nothing was risked and nothing was gained.

It's sad you don't know the difference.

You're a natural on camera kid.
你在镜头前表现得很自然。
At least you seem like it.
至少我是这么觉得的。
If you aren't, you better get used to it fast if you want to do well at the Tournament.
如果你只是在强装镇定的话，最好尽快适应它，不然很难在锦标赛中取得好成绩。
Hey hey, how's it hanging?
嗨，最近怎么样?
After taking that slamming I gotta go hit the routes for some training.
我刚刚被打击到了，现在正考虑外出历练。
But for now, I'm just a part of the crowd. Maybe you'll fight me again during the Tournament.
如今我只是一位普通观众了，或许我们之后还会在赛场上见面。
What about The Bench? Ah, I wouldn't worry. The Bench calls to people. Someone will answer The Bench eventually.
至于这张长椅？哈哈，它的吸引力会引诱下1个胜者来占有它！
I always look forward to battling here each year.

Hey, 'miring my team?
对我的队伍很好奇？
Of course you are. You're looking at the current ruler of The Bench.
难怪，毕竟你现在面前的，就是长椅的现任统治者。
OK! OK! We got a winner here!
好！好！好！现在这里出现了一位新的胜者!
The Bench is yours, treat it well. Feel the comfort of superiority flow through that seat.
这长椅是你的了，请善待它，感受这种上流的优越感吧。
Eyo, you beat me. But you didn't get me.
哎呀，你打赢了，但并没有完全击溃我。
Let's see if we can't get another round in. I ain't about to cede The Bench to any ol' schmuck.
找个时间我们再来一场吧，我可不想把长椅让给1个弱者。
Hit me up again whenever, I'll be ready.
过会儿再来，我准备一下。
Alright, that'll get you sorted.
你现在可以自主行动了。
Crowd should disperse soon enough once the other guys tell 'em that the coronation is on hold.
只要大家得知加冕仪式暂停，人群很快就会散去。
Anyways, you should head over ASAP.
总之，你还是尽快过去吧。
Tamarind doesn't like when her requests take too long, believe me.

I was gonna just throw some Normal-types at you and call it a day, but I'd feel bad.
我本打算随便给你几只一般属性精灵应付应付的，但又觉得过意不去。
I had Andris pull some strings and... and that name means nothing to you, so forget I said anything.
所以就让安德里斯托关系......反正你不认识这里的人，我说了也没用。
Point is, surprise! You get two starters: One standard three-stage Grass, Water or Fire, you know the drill, but also a Normal-type.

这是由马凯亚人发明的装置，它可以在战斗结束后自动生成1个被消耗掉的携带物品。
Berries, Gems, you name it.
比如说树果、宝石什么的。
Aaand here's some Poké Balls.
最后就是这几个精灵球。
Gonna be honest, I'm here on business too, so I really don't have another minute to spare on you.
坦白讲，我也是来这里出差的，所以真的没有时间和你闲聊。
There's a whole mess stirring on the coast up north, but that's - don't worry about that. Worry about getting your badges.
现在北部海岸那边一片混乱...但那跟你没什么关系，你只要想着怎么获得徽章就行了。
There's a Gym here, but <imp>Lambert</imp>, the leader, is out.
这里也有1个道馆，但是馆主<imp>兰伯特</imp>出门了。
I heard he went west to <imp>Bluepoint Beach</imp>.
我听说他去西边的<imp>蓝莹海滩</imp>了...
I've got bigger problems on my plate, though, so scram.
我没时间帮你解决这些问题，所以，自身玩去吧。
What are you waiting for? I got them laid out all nice and everything!
该给的该说的我都已经做完了，还不赶紧开始你自身的冒险去？
Didn't I say to leave me alone?
我说了别来打扰我！
Don't bother. I didn't have time to grab any room service.
里面是空的，不用费尽心思找食物了，
Not that I'd let you have any either way.
就算有我也不会给你。

The lake here used to be pretty. The ice rink is nice, but it just doesn't have the same appeal.
以前这个湖非常漂亮，虽说天然的溜冰场也不错，但我觉得没有之前吸引力大！
I remember this place started freezing a few years back, right before Team Chasm disbanded.
大概是几年前开始结冰的...就在裂隙队解散前夕。
I wouldn't put it past them to be behind it, they got their hands in everything.
我怀疑是他们搞的鬼，毕竟他们什么事都要插两手。
I've been trying to learn every sport lately.
我最近一直在学习各项运动。
Judo, baseball, tennis, even lacrosse. I've managed to hold my own against players in each of them.
我会柔道、棒球、网球，甚至学会了长曲棍球 ，我现在在这些项目都有准职业水准。
It's a long but rewarding process. My next project is figure skating.
这是1个漫长但有回报的过程，我的下1个项目就是花样滑冰。
That lady over there is killing it, so I'm trying to copy her movements.
那位女士的表现太出色了，所以我在试着模仿她的动作。
I used to be a hockey player, so ice skating is something that was natural to me.
我以前是个曲棍球运动员，所以滑冰对我来说毫无难度。
But I have to admit, figure skaters have something figured out.
但我必须承认，花滑运动员还是有点东西的。
Doing tricks on the ice feels great.
在冰上做出那些动作真的很带感！
Hey kid. If you're looking for your next adventure, I wouldn't advise going this way.
嘿，孩子，如果你准备前往下一站，那我不建议你走这条路。
An Avalugg avatar has appeared in the Ice Cave.
冰之洞穴里出现了冰岩怪化身。
If you do go in, you legally absolve the Rangers and the Svait Rescue Operation of responsibility.
如果你执意要这么做，那么在你进去的一瞬间，护林员和霜皑救援队就不需要再对你的人身安全负责了。
"Svait, experience an eternal snow season!"
"霜皑镇，雪花市的姊妹城！"
"Sister of Icirrus City."
"体验永恒的雪季！"
East: County Park
东：国立公园
South: Repora Forest
南：枯槁森林
North: Ice Cave
北：冰之洞窟
The Ice Cave is really a unique phenomenon. It spews out extremely cold air.
冰之洞窟里喷出的寒冷气流，改变了附近区域的气候。
It cools the area down so much that we get snowfall most of the year.
所以这里才会一年四季被冰雪覆盖，这也是马凯亚下雪最多的地方，必基尔纳山山顶上还多。
In fact, we get more snow even than Mt. Kilna.
至于冰之洞窟形成的原因，只能说是大自然的鬼斧神工了。
I've been coming to this lake once a year for over thirty years now.
三十多年了，我每年都会来这个湖1次。
Seeing this place grow and change has been both strange and exciting.
看着这个地方不断变化成长，感觉既奇怪又兴奋。
Boring. Boring. Boring. This place is so boring.
无聊。无聊。无聊。这地方真没劲。
I'm gonna teach your Pokemon a move. A move where they go wild and crazy like I really really really want to.
我要教你的精灵发狂技能！就像我超想超想超想的那样！
You'll be unstoppable.
你会所向披靡。
I stomped on the ice but its too thick and I just hurt my foot.
跺冰面结果太厚，反倒伤到脚。
Gotta wreck something. Maybe a snowglobe. I could throw that really far...
必须砸点东西。水晶球不错。能扔超远...
Ugh. I don't really get how to do this whole ice skating thing.
啊...我真的不会滑冰...
ACHOO!
啊嚏！
I think I've also caught a cold...
好像还感冒了...
The ice rink used to be a lake, yet it's entirely frozen now.
这个溜冰场以前是个湖，现在已经完全冻结实了。
This little pond stays unfrozen however.
但旁边这个小池塘却始终没有结冰。
What could have caused such an abnormal change in temperature in such a concentrated area?
到底是什么原因才让这里的气候出现异常的？
There you are.
给你。
I’ve had a chance to look more at the data on that USB.
我本有机会进一步查看U盘上的内容。
The people you got this from really didn’t bother to scrub anything off of it, huh?
我很怀疑之前拿到它的人，真的没有删除些什么吗？
I feel a little silly for spending all that time in the stacks.
我真是...太傻了，竟然在书堆里花了那么多时间。
All these findings and life's work worth of knowledge makes you feel very, very, small.
所有毕生心血换来的发现和知识，让我觉得自身...非常...非常渺小。
Are they satisfied to just, never act on the knowledge that they’ve obtained?
难道他们就能忍得住，不去就这些知识而采取些行动吗？
Hey. This might be an odd question, but…
哈，你或许觉得这个问题有些奇怪，但是...
Could you come and talk to me again when you have 4 or less Pokemon in your party?
这样，你先放下至少两只精灵，然后再过来跟我谈谈吧。
I think it’d be best if you come back when you have 4 or less Pokemon in your party.
我觉得你最好先确保，队伍里少于4只精灵再过来。
Great. Sorry.
非常抱歉。
Most trainers I’ve seen around the region only use parties of 4, so I felt a bit… Intimidated by your overwhelming strength.
因为我看到附近的训练师，大多数都只有4只精灵的队伍...所以我对你压倒性的力量有点...怕。
I have another possibly odd question for you.
另外...有个奇怪的问题要问你。
Have you ever caught a Legendary Pokemon before?
你抓到过传说中的精灵吗？
I was dreading that.
我担心的就是这个。
I don’t think I have it in me to let you become a hoarder like Team Chasm was.
我不认为我希望你成为像裂隙队那样的“收集者”。
These are forces of nature you’re messing with. And they need to be respected as such.
我们既然要应对大自然的力量，也应当尽可能地尊重它们。
You need to know where you stand.
你要明白自身的立场。
You need to know your place.
你要明白自身的位置。
Oh, good. Right, yeah!
那太好了，真的！
That’d be ridiculous if you did. It’d be like owning an Avatar.
如果你真的得到那些力量，谁知道什么时候又会有新的化身，或者类似化身的存在出现。
But… The Seekers were able to work with The Crafter to attain some sort of harmony with those.
不过...那些探索者如果...能够跟它们打成某种合作关系...
Even if I can find beauty in the primalness… Somehow, humanity managed to take control.
那究竟是依靠什么，才让人类在自然的力量面前，逐渐掌控了一切的呢？
…If anyone should be worthy of inheriting the legacy of the Seekers, it's me.
...哼哼，如果有谁，有资格继承他们的遗产，那非我莫属了！
I’m the one who put in all the time reading the research here.
花了那么多的时间研究报告，才使得一切得以重见天日。
I’m the one who picked their bones clean.
这一切都是我一直以来的努力！
If anyone should be worthy of inheriting the legacy of the Seekers, it's me.
...哼哼，如果有谁，有资格继承他们的遗产，那非我莫属了！
Even when I pull out all the stops, when I try my best to defang you, you bite down anyway.
我知道，即便我使尽浑身解数，想尽一切办法要阻止你，你依然会跟过来的。
You’re not human… You know, for a moment, it really flashed in my mind that maybe I could do something with all of this.
我脑海中有一瞬间，甚至怀疑过，你到底是不是人类...甚至还考虑过能不能利用这一点。
That I could attain my own facsimile of overwhelming power...
考虑能不能得到这一份，能够碾压我的力量的摹本...
But you’re just too strong.
但你还是太强了。
I’m all bark and no bite…
而我，就是个只会叫的弱者...
I’m so sorry.
抱歉。
I don’t know what came over me, \PN. I really lost myself for a moment.
其实我也不清楚到底怎么了，\PN，刚刚一瞬间...我仿佛失去了自身的意志。
Shows how easy it could’ve been for the Seekers and Team Chasm to let this go to their heads.
难怪当年的裂隙队...还有探索者，有那么多令人感觉疑惑又莽撞的行为。
Here, let me heal your team up.
来，让我治疗你的精灵。
Let’s go find what we came here for together.
然后一起去找这次的目的地吧。
Yes
抓过
No
没有

It’s Michi, Jovan’s Tropius. She seems to be hiding behind him.
那是米奇，约凡的热带龙。她似乎藏在他的身后。
It’s strange to see such a large creature look so worried.
看到这么大的生物看起来如此担忧，真是奇怪。
Okay, now just to dig the moat!

You know what? I'd best be spending me money instead of losin' it!
早知道我就把钱花掉了，现在都便宜了你！
Well, there goes me shore leave money.
完了，休假资金没了。
I developed a multi-hit attack during Lambert's self-defense course.
我在兰伯特的防身术课堂上，学会了多重攻击。
I don't get much chance to battle, though.
不过我根本没什么用上的机会。
Would you allow me the chance to teach my Multi Strike attack to your Pokemon?
需要我将多重攻击教给你的某只精灵吗？
It should be simple enough for many Pokemon, mostly Normal-type.
很多精灵都能学会这招，尤其是一般属性的那些。
Ah, excellent!
啊，太好了!
Ah, pardon my indulgence in even asking.
啊，打扰了。
Wait a minute sis! This loser doesn't even have two pokemon!
等下妹妹！这个菜鸡连两只精灵都没有！
Really? Teeheehee, get lost, loser.

我觉得自身还是很擅长对战的！要不要见识一下？
You... You're quite the battler...\wt[20]

I-I'm going to leave now.
我...我得走了。
You, defeat me? My goodness!
这...怎么可能？我...输了？
Wow, you found me again!
哇，你又找到我了！
A loss is a loss, I guess I owe you that second TM now.
输了就是输了，这个技能机也给你了。
I'll head back to town now. That was a fun game. I'm pretty worked up, hehe.
真好玩！嘿嘿！不过现在我要回去了，今天好开心！
Wow, you got here fast!
哇，你来得真快！
Freakishly fast. How many trainers did you beat on your way here...?

Er, and by that I mean—Hello again, \PN.
呃，我的意思是——你好啊，\PN。
As promised, here’s another invention for you to try out.

I found a bunch in an old storage container.
我在1个旧储物箱里找到了一堆。
It’s a way to <imp>read up on an opponent’s team</imp> before battling them.
这是一种在与对手对战之前<imp>了解对手队伍</imp>的方法。
I know, I know... the name is a bit silly. Thing doesn't even use X-rays.
我知道，我知道...名字有点傻。这东西甚至都不用X光。
But, hey, I work in R&D, not marketing.
但，嘿，我在研发部门工作，不是营销部门。
*Ahem*... Either way, I’ve got to return to the mainland.
*嗯哼*...不管怎样，我得返回大陆了。
I’ll be verifying some shipments that are being transported to Novo Town.
我会去核实一些运往望新镇的货物。
Maybe we’ll see each other there.
也许我们会在那里见面。
Until then, best of luck against Lambert!
直到那时，祝你对抗兰伯特好运！

Hello, and welcome to the Casaba Villa Pokécenter!
欢迎来到甜瓜精灵中心！
Oh, you're new to Makya, are you?
你是刚刚来到马凯亚吗？
An emergency measure was introduced recently to help trainers who might be in danger from avatar attacks.

According to that new measure, I'm supposed to give you this.

Thank you for your patience while I explained all of that.
感谢你配合我的工作。
I will resume my normal duties now.

Each Pokemon has their own Personality Traits.
每只精灵都有自身的独特之处。
Bonding with a Pokemon, and discovering what makes them unique, can be such a source of joy.
发现它们的优势，与它们建立起紧密的羁绊，就是旅途上最快乐的事。
Don't worry about your battles. No matter the personality, any Pokemon can be an excellent battler.
另外，不要畏惧对战，无论你拥有怎样的精灵，它们都可以在战斗中发挥作用。
Use whatever Pokemon you connect with the most.
所以尽请使用你更喜欢的孩子吧。
Oh, a trainer are you?
哦，你是训练师吗？
Would you be interested in taking my Sandshrew?
你有兴趣收下我的穿山鼠吗？
I brought it here from Alola, but I'm far too old to travel now, and it's getting restless.

I'd need $5000 in return. Sorry, but I've got to survive somehow!

After beating the seventh gym, I decided that me and the team needed a vacation.

I’ve got a Pokémon that needs fixing up, and, uh, it’s pretty bad.
我有只精灵需要治疗，它现在的情况很糟糕。
Uh, well – listen, if you promise to share I’ll let it out of its ball.
呃...好吧，只要你答应帮忙，我就把它从球里放出来。
I can’t take it to a Pokécenter because… you’ll see.
我没法把它带到精灵中心，因为...你会明白的。
You hand over some of your Aid Kit medicine.

You hand over a Fresh Water.

This is why I didn’t just go to a Pokécenter.
这就是我没有直接去精灵中心的原因。
It’s a Phione. Don’t bother looking it up in your 'dex – they aren’t even real.
它是一只霏欧纳，不用在图鉴里找了，它们理论上只存在于神话中。
Least, that’s what people say. Just a myth.
反正大家都这么说。
And, y’know how Makya is – I wasn’t about to show it off in public.
你应该大概知道马凯亚的风气是什么样的了吧？我可不想让太多人看到它。
Here, let’s get ya fixed up…

Dumb luck. Stumbled across a Manaphy one night and it gave me an egg.
纯属运气，那天晚上，我偶然遇到了一只玛纳霏，它给了我一枚蛋。
Didn't know if I was cut out for that, but couldn't exactly turn it down.

Figured it was a chance to do right, y’know?
我觉得这是做好事的机会。
Phione? They’re the children of Manaphy.
霏欧纳？它是玛纳霏的孩子。
That’s what I’ve heard anyways. Can’t find any solid records online of someone catching one.
反正我也是听说的，在网上找不到什么可靠记录。
Not everyone even believes they exist. But, uh, hey, this one’s real.
甚至很多人都不相信它真实存在，但显然，它是真实的。
Well, you helped me out, didn’t you?
对，并且你也帮助我了，不是吗？
Don’t really seem like a Pokémon thief to me. So, yeah, I guess I trust you.
我看得出你不像那些小偷，所以就向你寻求帮助了。
I was trying to train it up, but it’s a pretty fragile little thing.
我试着训练它战斗，但是它好像并不擅长这些。
Didn’t hatch all that long ago, and, well… I’m used to training hardier Pokémon.
一是它刚孵出来没多久...二是我习惯了训练强大的精灵。
Still trying to learn to be a li’l more gentle, you know?
我应该试着变得温柔一点。
Wait, guess I haven’t actually introduced myself.

I was so stupid, I thought I could win against the Beartic that's blocking the way down there.

It wiped out my whole team.
结果我的精灵都失去战斗力了。
You handled that Beartic with ease, incredible!
你竟然能解决那只冻原熊，真是太厉害了！
You didn't risk it just to help me, did you?
你冒这个险不是为了帮我吧?
Well, this is awkward...
嗯，这可真是尴尬啊...
Abraporter, activate!
凯西传送器，启动！
You really did a number on that avatar.

Too bad, I'm gonna find it first!
哼，我会率先找到的！
I'm here unofficially, so there won't be any paper trail linking me to this fiasco.
1次非正式的战斗而已，不会有任何一张纸记录我的败北。
Wait, paper trail? Hmm...

Lambert's gym is inspired by his old days of breaking up brawls and knockin' skulls!
这个道馆是馆主兰伯特根据以前在街头干架的亲身经历设计出来的！
Therefore his gym focuses on Fighting-type and Dark-type Pokemon.
所以，这里是格斗和恶属性的道馆。
You're new to Makya, right? Focusing on two types is standard for gyms in this region.
你是刚来马凯亚的吧？这个地区道馆一般都会使用两种属性的精灵。
If you want to take Lambert to task, Fairy-type Pokemon are your best bet.
说回到兰伯特这边，要想更轻松地对付他，妖精属性无疑是你的最佳选项。
Bug-type and Flying-type Pokemon are also useful!
当然虫属性和飞行属性也不错！
Hope that helps!
希望这些情报能帮到你！
You knocked some sense into him.
你把他打醒了。
Congrats!
恭喜！
Hey! We've got standards here, so show me some real talent or get out!
在这里就要遵守规矩，向我展示你真正的实力，不然就滚蛋！
Oh, Lambert's in for a real shock when he faces you! Wish I could see it!
哈，兰伯特肯定会对你的实力大吃一惊的，有好戏看咯！
Ouch! You didn't have to go that far, y'know...
呵呵，显然你没必要继续前进了...
Go on! I'll be back after I'm done pitying myself!
走开！让我自身缓一会儿！
You looking for a rematch? I’ll oblige you.
想要再来一局吗？
Ah, so you made it to me. Congrats.
啊，你终于来了，首先恭喜你。
Now, uh, things work a little differently ‘round here. Us gym leaders ain’t about to pull any punches.
其次，这里的道馆挑战稍有些不同，我们可不会吝惜自身的拳头。
Our teams have some bite to them, so make sure you’re ready before you try and take me on in a brawl.
我们的队伍肯定有很强的攻击，所以你在挑战之前，一定要做好相应的准备。
So, what can I do you for? You ready for a proper fight?

Ah, you’re killing me. Well, c’mon back when you’re ready.
哈？那你来干什么？等你做好准备再来吧。
Oh, I’ve got a good feeling about this bout.

Let’s dance!

Good choice. Well, up until now we’ve been best buds, but it’s time to show you what Makya’s taught me.
明智的选择。在此之前，我们是并肩作战的伙伴，但现在，我要向你展示我在马凯亚的毕生所学了。
I haven’t gone soft just yet.
燃烧吧，我的斗志！
Ready? Go!
准备好了吗？
I don’t know what to say. That was -- you’re the best trainer I’ve ever faced, and that’s including the kid that dismantled our entire Team.
我不知道该说什么好了。你刚才的表现简直离谱，比我见过的任何一位训练师都要强，包括那个解散我们组织的臭丫头。
You <i> dropped </i> me, like it wasn’t even a struggle.
整场战斗都在你的<i>掌控</i>之中，我现在马后炮都找不出获胜的可能。
Take it -- it’s the Loyalty Badge.
收下它吧 - 这是忠诚徽章。
I’ll heal up your Pokémon and get out of your way.
我会帮你的精灵恢复状态。
Actually... let's go talk at my house.
另外...去我家聊聊吧。
Well, you sure proved yourself this time. Feels like you could take on my entire team and then some.

她小时候得到了一只被取名叫蒿蒿的波克比，可以说是她的“初始精灵”。
She spent all her free time down in the caves, and one day she was trailing a li’l Larvitar too.
她平时总1个人呆着洞穴里，直到有天她后面跟着一只小幼基拉斯。
That little bastard grew up to be Autochthon. The others she caught who knows where.

Oh, that. Yezera never did get along with humans so well.
说到这个，叶泽拉从来都不太喜欢和人们相处。
Could barely handle going to school. It wasn’t until she started adventuring that she made a friend.
她完全无法适应学校的生活，直到开始冒险后，她才交到了1个朋友。

Woah there Trainer, you're 'miring Makya's top professional fish wrestler.
哇哦，训练师，你正在和马凯亚最顶尖的职业鱼类摔跤手打说话。
I'm all the brawn I'd ever need, but my operation could use an injection of brains.
我的肌肉已经足够发达了，但我终于意识到在行动中还需要一点头脑。
I'm thinkin' a Psychic-type 'mon might do the trick.
也许那些超能属性的精灵就能帮到我？
You got one of those on hand? I'll trade you my latest dub: a Remoraid.
你有这样的精灵吗？我可以用我最近捕获的铁炮鱼和你交换（可在箱子里选择精灵）。
Your loss. There's more fish out there. And I wrestle them for a living.

You ain't got a smart-pants to part with?

I wonder if I can teach this 'mon how to wrestle...

I don't want to be picking flowers! I want to be ominous and creepy for a villainous master! Here, let me show you!
我不想再做摘花的小女孩了！我要变成阴森可怖的邪恶大魔王！来，让我给你瞧瞧吧!
Wow! Do you, by chance, have need of an ominous fighting maid for your mansion? No? Fine, I'll go.
哇！你需不需要一位神秘的战斗女仆来保卫城堡呢？不需要？那...好吧...那我走。
Aww. Maybe if I was a better trainer Team Chasm wouldn't've collapsed...
唉，如果我能更强一些，裂隙队就不会解散了...
These graves have been here since before Team Chasm. I didn't let them poke around here, and I won't let you!
这些坟墓早在裂隙队成立之前就存在了。我不允许他们来冒犯这里，还有你也一样！
Maybe the spirits would return to their slumber if I stopped attacking people in their home... my apologies.
也许如果我停手，那些幽灵会回到它们的安息之地......对不起了。
Fine! If the spirits take you away, don't come crying to me!
好啊！如果鬼魂把你带走，可别来找我哭!！
Behold! The power of sea, air, and land!

The way I see it, the ocean is surrounded. What's under the ocean? That's right, more earth.
在我看来，海洋才是被包围的，你想想，在海底更下面是什么？没错，是更多陆地！

Guarding the bridge seems kinda pointless now that you can do that, huh?

Call me the 'sue' chef, because I'm gonna sue Helena for damages... or something...
叫我"起诉"大厨吧，因为我要起诉海伦娜赔偿我的损失...
Are you just -- fine, yeah, go on ahead. Just don't step on the bridge!
你...还好吧，那你快走吧。别待在桥上了!
Helena's instructions were quite clear. Try to cross the bridge, we battle you.
海伦娜指示我们在这里，阻击所有试图过桥的训练师。
When we've healed up, you'll be sorry for crossing us--er, the bridge.

She knows what she's doing... right?
她知道自身在干什么...吧？
Sure she does! We get to guard an entire bridge! Speaking of which, depart the bridge at once!
她当然知道！我们要守好这座桥！说到这，你给我赶快下去！
I'm really starting to think we aren't cut out for this.
我觉得我们真不适合干这个。
Yeah, if she thinks we'll stay out here for another week, I've got a bridge to sell her... did that even make sense?
嗯，要是她要求我们在这里待几周，那我到时是不是能把这座桥卖给她...真够可笑的。
...Let's just go double-check.

Oh, shut up. Let's just get back to the Pokecenter.

There's a graveyard to the East. Check it out, it's suuuuper spooky.

My mom's gonna kill me for ruining my shoes, but it's too fun to plod about.

I hear a Meowth makes you 33% luckier -- so now I'm guaranteed to win!
听说喵喵会给我带来三分之一的幸运，所以现在我肯定能赢！
Was that 33% increased luck or 33% more lucky? Maybe it isn't linear...?
是增加了三分之一的幸运还是变得更幸运三分之一了呢？所以到底是怎么算的...
Heads you win, tails I lose, huh...?
正面你赢，反面我输...诶？哪里不对？
My shoes...even my socks are soaked.

Huff...huff...
啊...呃...
Yezera never gave up, so neither will I!
叶泽拉从未放弃过，所以我也不能放弃！
No thanks.

I miss my bike.

Hey, Trainer. I've got an offer you might want.

My Pokemon breeding company has been producing too many Eevees.
最近我的饲育屋里降生了太多的小伊布。
They're a popular request, but market fluctuations left us with a bit too much excess.
虽说这种精灵一直很受欢迎，但最近的市场新规弄得很麻烦。
Contractually, I'm not allowed to give them away, but trading? A loophole covers me there.
我们之前的渠道基本都被锁死了，现在只有精灵交换这一种方法，还有些许空子可以钻（可在箱子里选择精灵）。
I'll trade you for any Normal-type Pokemon.

Who knows? Just a hunch.
指不定哪儿就会有别人不小心掉的。
Ohoho, so you've beat everyone in the club have you?
哦吼吼，所以说...你已经打败了俱乐部的所有人对吧？
Well, everyone but me.
呃，是除了我以外的所有人。
I used to be quite the battler, but that was a while ago, both me and my Pokemon have retired.
我曾经是位很强的训练师，不过那是很久以前的事，现在我和我的精灵都退休了。
We don't have enough energy to hike a route to find fights, but we always have enough for a good fight. Never did outgrow battling.
我们已没有精力四处寻求战斗，但热情却从未减退。
Will you entertain an old man like me?

More than you know. Much more than you know.

Oh, I’ve heard that one before. Family drama. Tale as old as time.
嗯，我听说过这个故事。家庭纷争，老生常谈了。
Best of luck with that, I s’pose.
那就祝你好运吧。
Great.
好的。
Ya don’t have to tell me. Not important.
你不用告诉我细节，不管他是谁，这不重要。
So long as you’ve got someone – you need somebody.
只要有就好 - 这样就会有动力。
Really? Nobody good enough for ya?
真的？其他人都不配做你的劲敌？
Well, s’pose it don’t matter too much. You’ve done plenty fine without one so far, right?
嗯，倒是也没什么所谓，反正你1个人也可以做到这种地步。
Hah!
哈哈！
Nah, kid. I already crossed that bridge, and it’s the kinda road ya don’t walk twice.
算了吧，小家伙。我已经走过那条路了，绝对不想再走第2次。
'Bout wore me out, too.
那可是很累人的。
You’re good, though, and I’m bein’ genuine.
不过，有一说一，你真的很强。
Ya beat my friend and now ya beat me.
你之前打败了我的朋友，现在又打败了我。
Ain’t half-bad. I ain’t paid to gab, though.
好吧 - 可惜没时间闲聊了。
Gotta get movin’ – Trubbish needs training, and the <imp>sewers 'neath LuxTech</imp> are the place to be for it.
我得继续训练破破袋了，<imp>光华市的下水道</imp>很适合它。
Here ya go, though, for your troubles.
这是给你的，麻烦你了。
See ya 'round. And, hey, you run into my friend again, beat the tar outta her, alright?
回头再见，哦对了，如果你再遇到我那个朋友的话，就狠狠地揍她一顿，好吗？
Hey-yo!
嘿 - 呀！
Hope you still remember me. I was the good-lookin' trainer camping out in front of the gym in Casaba Villa.
你还记得我吗，我是凡雅。之前在甜瓜道馆门口的训练师。
Well now I'm here, and the story's the same. Honing my skills with a team custom-built for the gym leader here.
现在我也来这边了，当然还是同样的事，训练一支专门为馆主准备的队伍。
Though I'm looking forward to it, it'll also be a little bitter-sweet having to take out a fellow enby.
虽然我很期待这次挑战，但要打败1个曾经的同窗，绝对不是一件简单的事情。
Anyways, I'll be here for now, ready and willing to battle you as much as you want!
总之，我会在这里待一段时间，只要你想，随时可以开始训练！
Wanna go?
开一局？
Understood.
明白明白。
I'll be here until you wish to battle.
我会在这里等你回来。
Glorious combat!
为了荣耀！
Ouch. That one hurts. Gotta get used to the pain, though, or else I won't stand a chance against Eko!
诶哟，好疼啊！不行，我得习惯疼痛，不然怎么可能打赢艾克！
A good fight, really got the blood flowin'.
真是热血沸腾的一战！
Return later for a rematch.
先休息一下，回头再打。
I can tell from the scorch marks that you went up against Eko, and from the gym badge...that you won!
从这些痕迹可以看出...你已经跟艾克打过了，并且你拿到了道馆的徽章！
That means the time for procrastinating is over, and the time for courage is nigh. Allons-y!
看样子不能再拖延下去了，是时候鼓起勇气面对他了。势必达成！
No.
等下
Yes.
行
No
不换
Yes
换
Not right now.
现在先算了
What exactly do you need?
你到底需要什么
Sure thing.
行吧
My brother.
我哥
Someone.
的确
You offering?
要不你来？
Maybe later.
稍等一下
Sure, let's go.
开就开
[Map57]
I get to go home... doesn’t even seem real yet.
我要回家了...这简直太不真实了。
I guess I’m still the gym leader.
我觉得我还是道馆馆主。
Gonna need to find someone else to take the job, eventually. But for now I get to go home.
到头来还是需要找其他人来接替这份工作...管他的，我终于可以回家了！
And maybe I’m gonna have a talk with Andris and the rest of them, about what happened.
也许我该和安德里斯他们好好谈谈发生了什么。
And about sticking me in a cave for a few years to deal with the consequences...
还有把我关在山洞里处理了几年烂摊子的事...
The Aether Foundation, from Alola, is looking to establish a branch in Makya.
来自阿罗拉的以太基金会正计划在马凯亚设立分部。
I'm here to do some location research for that, but I also have a secret project of my own.
我来这里是为了做选址调研，不过我还有个秘密项目。
To help me along, think you'd like to buy this Alolan Meowth?
为了帮我一把，你想买下这只阿罗拉喵喵吗？
For a low, low price of $5000, you could help me along.
只需5000金钱的低价，你就能帮我大忙。
Sure, I'm certain another Alolan Meowth will just stumble into your hands.
当然，我相信另一只阿罗拉喵喵会自身跑到你手里的。
Why thank you, stranger. Rest well knowing that you are a patron of science.
太感谢了，陌生人。安心休息吧，你可是科学的赞助者。
\PN hands over $5000 in exchange.
\PN递出了5000金钱作为交换。
Well, not gonna waste any more time here. I've got science to do.
好了，不在这儿浪费时间了。我还有科学要搞。
Hm? Pay? With what cash?
嗯？付钱？用什么现金？
Oh, sorry about the wait, I was just preparing to go back on duty.
哦，不好意思久等了，我正准备回去值班呢。
I've been investigating a group of thieves.
我在调查1个偷进化石的盗贼团伙。
They're hiding out in the \c[2]Kilna Turf\c[0], the route to the east of town.
听说他们逃到镇子东边的\c[2]基尔纳草径\c[0]了。
The tall grass makes a good hiding place for criminals and their stolen goods.
那些高高的草丛为罪犯和赃物提供了绝佳的藏身之处。
If you decide to go over there, you could nab yourself some items which have been forgotten by their owners and those thieves.
也正因为如此，那边总会有一些实力一般的训练师，
No need to worry--the trainers there aren't too strong.
抱着碰运气的态度，在草丛里寻找小偷遗留的物品。
Have a good one!
不多说了，再见！
No thanks.
不了，谢谢。
Sure, I'll pay.
当然，我付。

A Bicycle. It looks slightly dinged up.

Ended up burning down a tent, poisoning a clown, and freezing my brother.
然后就烧掉了一顶帐篷，毒晕了1个小丑，冻住了1个哥们儿。
I'm out of a job. Take pity, and buy 'em off me?
所以我就光荣地失业了，能不能把这些东西买下来，救济救济我呢？
I'm asking $5,000 for the three of them. Package deal.

I really dropped the ball on this.
这下彻底完蛋了。
My gratitude is immense!
感激不尽！
\PN hands over $5,000 in exchange.

Time to travel the countryside to find where they might need a man of my talents.
是时候去乡下转转了，看看有哪里需要我这种人才。
You're broke, just like me! Come back when you can help.
同是天涯沦落人啊！等你有钱的时候再来吧。
Young master, before you head out!
少主，稍等一下！
I should have told you this while we were sailing-- your family owns an unused Estate here in Makya.
我路上忘了告诉您 - 您名下有一处在马凯亚的庄园。
Since you're taking on the Makyan Gym Challenge, I took the initiative to renovate the grounds for our use.
由于之前一直处于弃置状态，所以我在听说您要来这边进行道馆挑战之后，便自作主张将其修缮了一番。
I've set up a system that sends the Pokemon you store in your PC to this <imp>PokÉstate</imp>.
这是我所写的1个程序系统，您可以将存储在电脑中的精灵送到这座<imp>庄园</imp>里休憩。
I'll take care of them there while you are busy with your journey.
当您忙于旅途时，我会在那里好好照看它们。
I love Pokemon variety, so I've prepared lots of <imp>EXP Candy</imp> to give you as your collection grows.
随着庄园里的精灵种类越来越多，我也可以给您提供一些<imp>经验糖果</imp>，帮助您完成这次的旅程。
Once you've earned some, I'll send them to you through the PC.
我会将它们寄存在电脑中，您可以随时取用。
Would you like to view the PokÉstate? I can take us over there for a visit.
现在要去庄园看看吗？
Understood, I'll wait for you on the boat in the mean time.
是，我会在这里随时恭候。
If you want to visit the PokÉstate, send me a ping at any PC.
如果您想要前往庄园，只需要用电脑发消息给我就好。
I'll take you there immediately.
我会立即带您前往那里。
Understood, I'll sail us over.
是，我这就带您前往。
G'day mate. Reckon its a fine day for fishin', yeah?
嘿，今天这天气很适合钓鱼啊！
Been fishing meself a storm lately, gotta ton of new Pokemon to show off.
最近我通过这种运动，抓到了不少新精灵。
Been rough with this one little bugga though, a Carvanha. Ain't getting along with the others.
不过有个小家伙让我很头疼，有只利牙鱼跟其他精灵合不来。
Tell ya what, been looking to get into Bug-type collecting for a while now.
这么说吧，我最近在找虫属性的精灵。
Might as well get started on it, if ya got one spare I'll trade ya for it.
如果你有多余的虫属性精灵，我就用那只利牙鱼跟你交换（可在箱子里选择精灵）。
No worries, mate. I'll be 'ere for a good while if ya change your mind.
不要紧，伙计，你要改主意了就再来找我吧。
All good, mate. Show me when ya got one.
好的，伙计，你抓到之后再来找我吧。
Right on.
好极了。
Reckon I could get a few more in a couple days.
这几天应该还能再弄几只。
Make a real sick collection of Bug-types, ya?
这样就有超级炫酷的虫属性大队了！
Good on ya for catching this 'mon, its a real beauty.
我很喜欢这只精灵，它真是漂亮极了。
Hey, you!
嘿，你！
Yeah, you, get over here!
对，就是你，过来！
I picked up this bike in Novo Town. The people up there are crazy for bikes, so it was easy to find one.
我之前在望新镇捡了辆自行车，那里的人几乎人手一辆，所以满大街都是。
For the same reason, though, everyone already got one, so I wasn't able to sell.
但也正因如此，根本没有出手的空间。
Seems like the whole job was a bust, so just take it.
这次“捡拾”也太失败了，干脆给你算了。
You never saw me, and I didn't cause you any problems. Peace.
你从来没见过我，我也不认识你，拜拜。
It looks excited to take on the next shipment!
它看起来很兴奋，准备迎接下一批货物!
The berry plant is growing.

Every week a shipment comes of groceries and other necessities for Novo Town.
要维持大城市的灯红酒绿，就必须得稳定各地的物资支援。
They get some stuff from the big city, but can't rely on it for everything.
每周都会有一批食物和生活必需品，在这里装货，运往望新镇。
Mt. Kilna makes it harder to get stuff in between, even with Gigalith's Guts cutting through it.
即便怪岩肠道贯穿了基尔纳山，也因为受到地形的限制，无法进行大规模的陆路运输。

I'm bored of searching for the <imp>Dragon Den</imp> around here.
我受够了，这里哪有<imp>龙穴</imp>。
Let's battle, instead!
不管了，来跟我打一架吧！
Welp, looks like we're not close to an even match.
唉，看来我们实力差距很大。
You just make sure to keep on truckin' with that team of yours!
你一定要取得更高的成就！
If only I had that Dragon-type...
如果我有那只龙属性就好了......
Looking forward to seeing how you grow!
很期待你将来能达到的高度！
A sharpened mind is the key to victory. Has yours been whetted?
敏锐清晰的头脑是取胜的关键，我会让你好好见识一下的。
Yours is a razor's edge. I must hone my own.
你的脑子比我的更好使，必须加紧磨练自身了。
Outsmarted and outmatched...for now.
被以智取的方式完胜...不过这只是暂时的。
The door is locked with an old rusty padlock.

Whatever. Here.
随便啦。给你。
This thing will save you time like you wouldn’t believe.
这东西会节省你难以置信的时间。
More convenient than flying everywhere.

I’d use one, myself, if not for the nausea.
如果不是因为会晕，我也会用1个。
But uh… it probably won’t affect you!
但呃...它可能不会影响到你！
My next official stop is at <imp>Prizca West</imp>, north of the river. Let’s meet up there—
我的下1个官方停靠点是在河以北的<Imp>西宏礼市</imp>。让我们在那里见面-
Actually… I’ll be making a pitstop at <imp>LuxTech</imp> first. Stop by, if you’d like.
实际上...我将首先在<imp>光华科技</imp>上停留。如果您愿意，请停下来。
Or don’t. I don’t control your life.

At least this time I don’t have to figure out where she is…
至少这次我不用去琢磨她在哪儿了...
I swear…
我发誓...
Hey, give me some practice, won't'cha? I'm gonna need it to become one of Eko's gym trainers!
你好，能帮我训练训练吗？我还需要积累更多的实战经验，才能成为艾克的道馆训练师！
Ouch! Maybe I need to go back and study some more. I don't even have a Poison-type yet!
哎哟！感觉还得继续学习，我连只毒属性精灵都没有！
See? I didn't do too bad! I could totally work for them!
看见没？我的水平还不错！我绝对可以胜任这份工作!
You got some hot moves! Remind me to introduce you to Lainie -- she'd love ya!
你的那些技能很给力啊！我觉得应该把你介绍给兰妮 - 我想她会喜欢你的！
I'm searchin' for that bolt of lightning to inspire me. Hit me with it!
我正在寻找那突然的灵光一闪，不知道你能不能给我带来灵感！
Ah, I just found the perfect riff! I need to have Lainie listen to this! She'd love it!
我找到完美的旋律了！我要赶快去弹给兰妮听听，她一定会喜欢的！
Damn! I was feelin' it for a second there, but then it just fell apart.
淦！我刚找到一丢丢灵感，结果一下子又全没了！
Serves me right for composing during battle.
这就是在战斗中创作的坏处。
Maybe if I turn like this he'll catch my good side.
如果我转一下身，他或许能捕捉到更好的画面？
Take a hike, we have a portrait to finish!
一边待着去，没看到我们正忙着画肖像吗!
Excuse me, I'm posing here.
抱歉，我们正在画肖像！
Don't interfere with the artistic process!
不要干扰艺术创作！
I somehow managed to paint you into the portrait...
不知道为啥就把你画进去了...
It's been a rocky enough job as it is.
难啊...
It looks like it's taking a needed rest on the bench.
它看起来需要多休息休息。
It’s Michi, the Tropius.

就算你没有打扰到我们，想要完成这幅画的难度也很大。
You ready? Can we – can we skip the talking and just fight?
 你准备好了吗？我们——能不能别废话，直接开打?
No.
不打
A Togekiss?
用波克基斯？
Let's go.

Ello, landlubber, welcome to the Fin.
你好，旱鸭子，欢迎来到鱼鳍港。
You aimin' your sights at the rest of Makya?
你不会还打算去马凯亚的其他地方吧？
I were you, I'd take care not to end up like them wrecked boats out west o' 'ere.
如果我是你，就会保持谨慎，别落得西边的那些破船一样的下场。
Damn rich folk and their careless sailin'...
那些脑残的有钱人连船都不爱惜...

Heal Bell would be so nice to have for this gym.
如果带1个治愈铃声就好了。
I did a mistake letting my Skitty forget it.
我竟然犯这种错误。
I'll have to visit the Move Maniac so my Skitty can <imp>relearn</imp> Heal Bell.
我得去找技能教学狂，让我的向尾喵<imp>重新学会</imp>这招了。
He's hanging in the Novo PokeCenter.... and in practically every other PokeCenter, somehow.
望新的精灵中心应该有吧...毕竟在每个精灵中心都能见到他们。
At the northernmost part of the Shipping Lane there is a house, and inside of that house a cave, and in that cave an Avatar!
在扬帆路最北端有一座房子，房子里面有1个山洞，山洞里有1个化身！
Destroy it!
消灭它！
I’ve been waiting years to find a trainer good enough to eradicate it, and you’re the one!
我已经等待多年了，等待1个足够强大的训练师，而你就是那个人！
This key will get you inside, and then just, well, do what I would do!
这是那里的钥匙，然后，照我说的做!
Oh, and be a dear and don’t ask anymore questions. Good luck!
啊，多的别再问了，祝你凯旋！
It waits in the suspicious house in the Shipping Lane! Destroy it, and rid me of the damnable thing for good!
它就在扬帆路那栋可疑的房子里！彻底解决那个该死的东西，让我脱离苦海吧！
Oh? Have you sent the avatar back from whence it came?! Excellent! Your talents are second-to-none!
哦？你已经把那个化身送到它该去的地方了？好！真是让人放心的实力！
I thought this gym would be a cinch.
我本以为这个道馆会很简单。
A whole team of fish couldn't possibly lose to a Fire- type gym!
毕竟我的鱼鱼队伍是不可能输给火属性道馆的！
I totally forgot that Poison is strong against Water.
但我忘了现在毒克水！
What, do you miss the lick of flames and bite of acid? Shall we duel once more?
什么，你怀念火焰的舔舐和酸液的咬噬了？ 那就让我们再决斗一场吧！
Congratulations on reaching me!
恭喜你来到我的面前！
And congratulations to all your Pokémon! Especially the ones that are on fire!
也同样恭喜你所有的精灵！尤其恭喜那些浑身冒火的！
Show us what you’re made of and push through that pain! Just a little longer now!
现在，展示你的实力，坚持下去！我觉得你应该知道该怎么做。
Are you ready for the grand finale?
准备好观看压轴大戏了吗？
Go on, then! Take a minute! Get your Pokémon some antidotes, or a fire extinguisher!
当然可以！给足你时间！顺便准备好解毒剂和灭火器！
Very well, challenger! I present to you the fullest onslaught I can muster!
很好，挑战者，我将向你展示我最猛烈的攻击！
Every other gym leader is a coward, but not I!
其他道馆馆主都是胆小鬼，但我不是！
I know that there is only way to test someone: Over! Whelming! PAIN!
我知道考验1个人的方法只有一种：极度的痛苦!
Now overcome it, or fall!
现在要么克服它，要么万劫不复！
Lovely! Make no mistake: my panoply of agony takes no half measures.
太好了！另外：我可不会手下留情。
I’ll test you with fire and acid, claw and fang!
我会用火焰、酸液、利爪以及尖牙来考验你！

Not to mention: the Perseverance Badge!
这是你的，毅力徽章！
If you can overcome my gym in such blazing style, I can surely expect great things from you.
如果你能以更炽烈的风格战胜我，我肯定可以对你寄予厚望。
Perhaps... there is something we absolutely must talk about!
或许...有些事情我们可以...不对，是绝对，必须谈谈！
I’ve got a mission for you, challenger! Something worthy of your skill, I promise.
我有1个任务要给你，这绝对是配得上你本事的委托。
Good! Good! Never let that fire within you go out!
很好！很好！永远不要让你内心的那团火熄灭!

I’ll get your Pokémon healed.

I yearn for the day I might challenge you again! Either here, or in the Championship!
希望有一天能再次考验你！不管是在这里，还是在联盟大赛上!
So long!
再会！
Bruh... this waiting room doesn't have any places to sit down.
唉...这个等候厅里连个座位都没有。
No pain, no gain? Must be what Eko's thinking.
估计这就是艾克的主意，让我们在这里体会痛苦。
This is not a lab! It is a gym! In labs we have safety precautions. Here, unsafe conditions are the goal!
这里不是实验室！这是个道馆！在实验室里我们得遵守安全准则，但在这里，不安全就是我们的准则!
Oh-ho? So you want safe passage? Very well. You've earned the shortcut.
哦？你想安全通过？好吧，你赢得了使用捷径的权力。
The wild reaches of Makya won't have safety guidelines. If you can endure this, you can endure them.
马凯亚的野外可没有安全准则可循。只要你能忍受这里的考验，就能在外界生存下去。
White text flies by on a dark purple background.
白色的文字在紫色的屏幕上快速滚动着。
Yo, champ in the making!
嘿，未来的冠军！
Eko is the gym leader here, and they love pain in all its forms.
这个道馆的馆主是艾克，他是个热爱各种形式痛苦的训练师，
Therefore they picked Fire and Poison as their specialties.
所以他选择了火属性和毒属性，作为这个道馆的配置。
Ground-types are rather strong in this gym. Psychic-types and Rock-types are none too shabby either.
所以地面属性精灵的优势最大，超能属性和岩石属性也很不错。
The final piece to this gym's puzzle are the teleporters.
这个道馆里面有一些传送门。
See those blue pads? The ones the trainers are protecting will teleport you past the maze.
看到那些蓝色的地砖了吗？踩到它就会将你传送出来。
If you don't unlock them, you'll find yourself walking a harsh path!
如果能够解锁这些传送门，会对你的挑战提供很多帮助。
'Grats on beating the gym!
恭喜你通过了道馆挑战！
You pushed through the pain just fine.
你成功克制了自身的痛苦。
Sorry for blocking the way, but I'm desperately dehydrated.
抱歉，我挡了你的路，但我已经有些脱水了。
You have a <imp>Fresh Water</imp>! I'll be taking that...
你有一瓶<imp>美味之水</imp>！我想要的就是这个...
The man takes a Fresh Water from your bag.
他以迅雷不及掩耳之势，从你的包里拿走了一瓶美味之水。
Ahhhh.... that helps a lot. Thanks.
啊...得救了，万分感谢。
Consider the lockdown over.
我这就让开这条路。
The scientists keep offering me liquids in beakers, but I've had too many close calls with caustic chemicals to just trust 'em on the contents.
这里的科学家们只用烧杯提供给我一些奇奇怪怪的液体喝，但我见过他们做实验的样子，实在是不敢下口。
I can't leave my post, so blocking the gym entrance is my only leverage.
但我又不能随便离开岗位，所以只能用这种方法寻求生命之源。
I'm plopping down here until a challenger like yourself grabs me a <imp>Fresh Water</imp>.
我只能等在这里，期盼着那些...训练师带来的<imp>美味之水</imp>。
There are <imp>vending machines</imp> in all PokéCenters and Ranger Stations.
所有精灵中心和护林员哨站都有<imp>自动售货机</imp>。
I hope you won't find this cruel. The suffering I'm about to inflict is strictly necessary.
我希望你不会觉得这残忍，因为这些是必须承受之痛。
...Noted. Please avail yourself of this teleporter. Taking the long way may subject any afflicted Pokemon to undue injury.
...好的，你可以使用传送门了。绕远路会对受伤的精灵造成持续的2次伤害。
Thank you for your participation. Step carefully, now! Wouldn't want any lingering side effects... heh.
感谢您的参与，但现在请小心行事，只要你不想留下后遗症...呵呵。

Our glorious Champion! Good evening!
晚上好，我们的冠军！
Or morning! I’m not in the business of keeping count of the hours. That’s for the interns!
还是说早上好？无所谓，我不负责计时工作，那是实习生该干的事！
Now, why are you here? Hoping for a rematch? Looking to learn more about me?
那你来这里做什么？希望再来一场重赛？还是说想更多的了解我？
Sorry! I’m busy! Drastically, obscenely busy! There is much work to be done, and I absolutely cannot spoil what it might be!
但是很抱歉，我现在很忙！忙得要命，忙得头疼！我现在有太多的工作需要做了！
Goodbye, \PN. We’ve already had our last battle.
再见，\PN。我们的最后一战已经结束了。

Wow! Well done! That must have been nervewracking.
好好好！这可真不容易。
I wonder why those two Pokemon came here in the first place.
不过问题是那两只精灵为什么会出现在这种地方？
Aren't Absol drawn to areas with upcoming disasters?
阿勃梭鲁不是只有在通知灾难时才会现身吗？
Yikes. I hope they predicted wrong.
哎呀。我希望它们预测错了。
Anyways, thanks for all the help.
不管怎样，谢谢你的帮助。
I'm gonna get out of this place, it's got to be packed with bad vibes.
我得赶紧离开这个地方，以免真的发生什么不好的事。
Oh, man, perfect timing!
诶哟，来得正是时候!
I came up here to investigate a noise complaint.
我是在接到投诉之后，来这里检查噪音来源的工作人员。
Turns out there's this freaking ghost spirit thing running around!
发现有1个该死的幽灵在到处乱跑！
Then out of nowhere an Absol busts into the room and they start staring each other down!
然后有只来历不明的阿勃梭鲁突然闯进了这个房间，它们就这样互相盯着对方看！
I'm too afraid to get close, and I'm too afraid to leave them alone.
我不敢靠近，也不敢离开。
Could you, ya know, deal with it?
你...你能处理一下吗?
Well don't look at me, I left my Pokemon at home!
别看我，我把精灵留在家里了！
Absol is silently staring at the spirit.
阿勃梭鲁默默地盯着对方。
It has a tense expression, but it's shaking slightly.
它的表情很紧张，身体在微微颤抖。
The Absol looks at you, expression blank, but trembling.
阿勃梭鲁看着你，神色茫然、颤抖不已。
If you tried to catch it, it probably wouldn't put up a fight.
或许这正是抓住它的好机会。
You'll leave the Pokemon here for now.
你暂时将精灵留在这里。
You bring out a Pokéball from your bag while petting the Absol on its head.
你从包里拿出1个精灵球，同时抚摸着阿勃梭鲁的头。
You swear you see the faintest smile form on it before it enters the ball.
在它进球之前，你看到它嘴边浮现出一丝微不可见的弧度。
You don't have a Pokeball to give it.
你没有精灵球可以装它。
No

I'm participating in the current archival project at the Digsite Ruins.
我正在参与一项遗址发掘项目。
Those ginormous statues won't document themselves, so we have to!
那些巨型雕像缺少文字记录，所以只能靠我们猜着写！
I wrote a whole paper on the special significance of where each Regi was placed in the main chamber.
我上一篇论文全部篇幅都在介绍每位巨人都代表着什么意义。
I spy a MasterDex!
你有大师图鉴！
Yours truly submitted lots of information for that project.
看样子你收集了很多信息。
Collecting information on this here Boldore was especially difficult.
对于拥有一只地幔岩的我来说，想要收集这些并不容易。
She just loved phasing my carefully collected notes out of existence!
她有时候会把我的文件弄坏！

I always thought of myself as quite dedicated, but my roommate blows me out of the water.
我一直认为自身是死忠粉，但我的室友让我开了个大眼。
I've gotta scrounge up some more Eevee Tickets and visit that pub in Prizca East.
我还得再搞几张伊布票，然后去东宏礼市的酒吧。
Then, I'll be able to call myself a true fan!
这样就能算是合格的死忠粉了吧！
DO YOU LIKE GALARIAN ZIGZAGOON?
你 喜 欢 伽 勒 尔 蛇 纹 熊 吗 ？

I gained a lot of weight living on my own, with no parents to stop me from binging ice cream.
1个人生活的时候，就没有父母来阻止我狂炫冰淇淋了，所以体重增加了很多。
I started swimming to try and get in shape. I even went ocean swimming!
为了保持身材，我开始游泳，从池塘到河流，再到大海！
Soon after, though, this accursed Pokemon started following me around! It won't leave me alone!
然后就被这只可恶的精灵盯上了，一直纠缠不休！
All it does is poke my stomach over and over while smirking! It makes me feel really self conscious.
它总是一边傻笑一边戳我肚子！这让我感到很不自在。
I want a NICE Pokemon! One that I can go for runs with and one that doesn't make me feel awful all the time!
我想要温顺的精灵！能陪我跑步不会总让我难受的！
A uh... Fighting-type! A noble Fighting-type! Perfect for an exercise buddy.
没错...格斗属性！高贵的格斗属性！完美的运动搭档。
Please, if you have one, I will trade you for it.
如果你有，我会用它来和你交换（可在箱子里选择精灵）。
Ohhh.. What am I to do?
哦...我该怎么办？
Please don't bother me, it makes the pain worse.
请不要拿我开玩笑，这只会让我更痛苦。
Thank you, you've done me a huge favor.
谢谢你，你帮了我1个大忙。
Please, take it somewhere it can be as mean as it wants. Just not to me.
把它带去什么鬼地方都行，只要不是在我身边就好。
Thank you friend. I feel better now.
谢谢你，朋友。我现在感觉好多了。
Your Pokemon is helping me keep in shape.

I'll soon have the beach bod of my dreams!

I was attacked by an avatar a few weeks ago.
1个月前我被化身攻击了。
You'd think that I'd know how to battle since my parents were Chasm, but no.
虽说我的父母都是裂隙队成员，但我对对战一窍不通。
I was caught with my pants down.
所以就只能屁滚尿流地逃走了。
I only met my roommate recently.
我最近才认识我的室友。
Apparently both of her parents... Were in Team Chasm?
听说她的父母都是...裂隙队成员？
I guess I shouldn't judge. I hear some professors still hold a grudge, though.
我知道不应该随意评判这些，不过我听说有些博士仍怀恨在心。
Their fight with Team Chasm ended like a decade ago, right? Why keep the bad blood?
一方面，他们和裂隙队的斗争十年前就已经结束了，为什么还要彼此仇视呢？
But on the other hand, if somebody sicced a Salamence on my school, I'd be pissed.
但从另一方面来说，如果有人派一只暴飞龙攻击我们的学校，我也会很生气。
[Map73]
I've been working with the local Pokemon Center in order to improve the healing stations.
为了改善治疗装置，我一直在与当地的精灵中心合作。
The college gave me a decent grant in order to do so. I'm trying to make the thing more energy efficient.
学院也给了我一笔可观的补贴，支持我研究如何让这机器更加节能。
Hopefully this research will let us set up centers in even more places.

Fed up with doing nothing -- Out hunting Avatars.

Get the hell out of my room!
滚出我的房间！
Give me a second to compose myself. I'd like to give an apology if you talk to me later.
让我稍微冷静一下。你吓了我一大跳。
Ok. Sorry. I'm calmer now. That was really rude of me to do that.

Just get out of here! Leave, ok?
快离开这里吧，伙计！离开，好吗？

确实，我不该大吼大叫，只是...我不喜欢被打扰。
Doesn't excuse my behavior though.

Sorry.
抱歉了。
Here, take this. As a token of goodwill. I shouldn't be drinking caffiene anyways.

I'll be better next time.

Just leave, ok!

Zoé forever! Bence should pack it up and go home!
佐伊万岁！本斯该收拾行李回家了！
Oh, you've never heard of them?
啊，你没听说过他们？
Zoé is the rock-tough Gym Leader of Prizca West, and Bence is a loser weakling trying to take her spot.
佐伊是西宏礼市的道馆馆主，而本斯是1个充满嫉妒心，妄图取代她位置的可怜弱鸡。
You'd think the government would do something, but the Gymnasium Office has cowardly ignored all my emails.
我为此给政府部门写了好几封邮件，但道馆管理办公室却无视了我。
You got the Prizca West badge, that means... you beat Zoe?!
你拿到了西宏礼道馆的徽章，也就是...你打败了佐伊？
You must be some trainer. I've still got a ways to go before I can even approach her level.
你一定是位出色的训练师。要达到她的水平，我还有很长的路要走。
...tell me you wallopped Bence, too, right?
...你也痛扁了本斯一顿，对吧？
[Map77]
I hope I get to go spelunking for my Paleontology courses.
我希望能去参加古生物学老师组织的洞穴探险活动。
Makya has such grand caves, after all. It'd be a shame to not get to see them.

There's one with a bunch of petrified Pokemon. And one where water flows in intricate patterns.

And! And... I'm boring you, aren't I.
除此之外还有...你觉得我很烦是吗？

搬家真麻烦，我真希望永远不要有下1次。
I found this while unpacking. I don't know where I got it, and I don't want it.

Take it. I don't want another trip to the dumpster.
给你了，这样我也少扔一趟垃圾。
Unpacking suuuuuuucksssss. Chores suuuuckkkkk.
可恶的搬家...可恶的家务活...
Ugh.
啊，让我死了算了。

The Kadabra is focusing very hard.

Because of this, they offer jobs for trainers to bring in the Pokemon needed for new studies.

I'm collecting money to buy her an appreciation gift.
我正在凑钱给她买一份感谢礼物。

We decided to surprise her with some high quality Pokemon handling gloves.
最后我们决定给她1个惊喜，买一副高质量的绝缘手套。
That way she can pet her Ampharos without having to worry of getting shocked!

Finding data is one thing, but interpretation is a whole different beast.
查找数据是一回事，分析数据是另一回事。
Interpretation isn't as clear cut as just collecting more data.

Oh, hey. Uh. Yeah. Secure the funding.... zzz...

Keeping inventory here is tough work.
管理仓库这项工作非常艰巨。
Trainers and scientists often just take from here without filing the paperwork properly.
训练师和研究员们来拿东西，经常不打招呼不做报告。
As a result, we often just lose things. Stranger still, sometimes we just GAIN things.
所以经常会出现一些物品突然消失的情况，但最奇怪的是，有时候还会莫名多出一些东西。
Like this TM, which no one's bothered to claim.
比如说这个技能机，根本没人认领。
Honestly, just take it. Make my job easier.
给你了，让我的工作轻松点吧。
They don't pay me enough to deal with this stuff.

Of course, learning how to make them do what we want is the hard part...
当然，对于新手来说，学会如何用电脑是最难的部分...

Ugh.
啊...
I wanted to interview Helena.

She said we'd have a 15 minute time frame to get a recorded interview.

It was a ton of fun, but it was also exhausting.
虽然很有趣，但也很累。
I gotta make sure we don't overdo it.
我总怕不小心弄坏什么东西。
We're here on correspondence about LuxTech's sponsorship of the upcoming League Tournament.
我们这次来这里，打算询问一些关于光华市对联盟大会的资助信息。
The employees here must have all gotten some basic media training. Lots of them were comfortable in front of the camera.
可这里的员工一定都接受过专业训练，在面对镜头的时候非常自然，
Some even gave me free stuff.
甚至还有人送给我一些小礼物。
You should take some of it off me, though, cause my equipment already weighs a ton!
但是这摄像设备太重了，我根本就拿不下这些！
I'll talk with my co-worker once we get home. We can probably stitch together something interesting.
回去之后再跟同事们商量商量，看能不能拼凑出一些有趣的新闻。
Ah, good news? Excellent! Hand over the shipment.
有好消息了？很好，把货物给我吧。
You give the shipment to Helena.
你把货物交给海伦娜。
This sets us a few days ahead of schedule -- well, ahead of the adjusted schedule.
这可以让我们的计划在货物出现问题后，依然能在原定时间内完成。
Regardless, I will uphold my end of this transaction.
放心，我说到做到。
Meet me in my gym when you’re ready. And do try and be prompt.
准备好就来道馆找我吧，尽量准时到。
No, I don’t have anything better to do than wait here for someone to get my shipment back from wherever in the caves it ended up.
我没有别的事情可做？没办法，最重要的货物还在山洞里呢。

我的勇基拉就学了好几种编程语言。
He's the perfect "Rubber Ducklett", catching mistakes as soon as I type them!
他就是最完美的“纠错人”，每次我输入错误他都会立即发现！
Hey, are you \PN? Mavis’s child?
哦，你是 \PN？梅维斯的孩子？
I haven’t seen you since you were Munchlax-sized.
上次见你的时候，也就跟小卡比兽差不多大吧。
Oh, excuse me, were you registering for a challenge?
啊，抱歉，你要预约挑战？
We’re processing all the latecomers trying to get into the Championships, plus logistics for the event itself, so -- actually.
我们正在处理一些关于锦标赛参加者的事务，以及相关比赛的后勤工作，所以...现在...
You’re chasing Zain, I presume?
你是在追赶赞恩？
Of course. I lost to him, oh, a week and a half ago?
没错，我输给他了，大概在十天之前？
I understand that rivalry -- and I understand you don’t have a few weeks to spare.
我知道你们的竞争关系，也理解你赶时间的想法。
Just like I don’t have time to wait for a particularly late shipment to arrive.
就像我工作时也没时间等待那些运送得特别慢的货物一样。
Normally I’d praise you for playing your cards close to your chest, but not with me.
如果是平时，我会夸你能隐藏自身的想法，但现在还是开门见山的好。
Don’t play coy -- I’m smarter than that. I’m cutting you a deal, so be smart and listen.
我不傻，知道你们的事情。现在我是要跟你做一笔交易，所以不用做多余的掩饰了。
...Fine. I don’t believe you, but I’ve been wrong before.
...好吧，说实话我不信，但我以前也判断错过。
Rarely.
虽然极少。
In any case, you’re not the patient sort, and if Tamarind is to be believed you have a knack for dangerous errands.
总之，你不像个很有耐心的人，如果塔玛琳说的没错，你应该很擅长执行一些危险任务。
I need a shipment located.
我需要找到一批货物。
There’s a tunnel we call Gigalith’s Guts to the southwest. It links the Kilna Turf to the County Park.
西南边有一条我们称之为怪岩肠道的隧道，它连通了基尔纳草径和国立公园。
You can imagine how convenient that little shortcut is for shipping, and hence why a hypothetical important set of objects would be routed through it.
你应该能想象得到这条路对于货物运输来说有多么便捷，所以有些重要的货物会通过那里进行运送。
Those objects are late, and now I’m hearing that the Guts are clogged with avatars.
但那批货物现在还没送达，据说是因为怪岩肠道被化身占领了。
Wh-what? You already have the shipment?
什、什么？那些货物就在你手上？
I’m not going to ask why you have this.
好吧，我不会多问的。
Well. No matter.
看样子，既然问题解决了。
Um, I suppose I have to accept the challenge now.
我无论如何都要接受挑战了。
Let’s capitalize on this inexplicable lack of delays and have a quick battle, yes?
那就趁这个空挡尽快结束，如何？
To be explicit: save me time and get me my shipment, and I’ll save you time and put on my gym leader hat for a challenge.
简单来讲：你如果帮我节省拿到货物的时间，我就帮你节省道馆挑战的时间。
LuxTech's main business is in Technical Machines, so naturally we have a ton of programmers and computer scientists.
光华科技的主要业务是器械制造，所以我们有大量的程序员和计算机领域的人才。
However, LuxTech spends a decent amount on research as well, so there's scientists everywhere too.
不过光华在其他研究上也投入了不少资金，所以到处都能看见研究员。
On top of that, we employ former pro-trainers to test our new products.
我们还聘请了一些前精英训练师，帮助我们对新产品进行测试。
Speaking of which, take this. I was told to give it to Trainers who talked to me.
说到这里，收下这个吧。上级说如果有训练师来跟我聊天，就把这个给他。
The diversity here is wonderful.

Go back and fight them all, then come back to me.
去挑战大家吧，然后再来找我。
I have no more to offer you, I'm afraid. Your battling data was excellent, so it's a shame.
恐怕我拿不出什么奖品了，你的战斗数据非常优秀，所以很遗憾。

One of the scientists here gave me a batch of weird rocks, and told me to give some to my Mudsdale.
有个研究员给了我一批奇怪的石头，她让我把其中一部分给我的重泥挽马带上。
I now understand why she said "some" instead of "all".
我现在明白她为什么说的是“一部分”而不是“全部”了，我的精灵现在飘在半空，根本没办法下来。
I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do except wait until the effect wears off.
我不知道我该怎么办了，只能在这里等它效果消失。
Here, I have one more. You should take it, I've done enough damage as it is.
给，就是一颗这样的石头，你拿走吧，我已经受够了。
I hope someone comes along soon. Me and my Pokemon are starting to get hungry.
赶紧来人帮忙啊，我和我的精灵都饿了。
Phew. One of the scientists was able to help reverse the effects of the Float Stones.

I'd love to tell you about what I'm studying, but that might ruin the experiment!

There's no reward to earn by defeating them, and your Pokemon will learn nothing from the experience...
打倒他们不会有任何奖励，你的精灵也不会从中学到什么......
But you and I both, well, we'll gain terabytes of wisdom about battling.

Ah, hello. A trainer, I take it?
啊，你好。你是一名训练师吧?
And a foreigner as well. Don’t ask me how I can tell – it’s plain enough. Well, we’re alike in that.
而且你还是外国人。不要问我怎么看出来的，很明显，而且我也是“老外”。
Tell me, have you found any Makyan regional forms yet?
你见过马凯亚特有的精灵地区形态吗？
I hadn’t realized they were so poorly-known.
它们知名度这么低？
Every region has its own unique environmental pressures. In the most extreme cases, these lead to radically different subspecies of Pokémon.
因为每个地区环境不同，会使部分精灵在极端条件下，产生与正常形态截然不同的亚种。
Makya is home to its fair share.
马凯亚地区也有一些这样的精灵。
How unfortunate. I hear Makyan Sentrets have been a favorite of trainers seeking to challenge Eko.

Perhaps you could benefit from one?
对你来说应该也是不错的选择。
Good. I can imagine they’d be invaluable to a trainer.
很好，对训练师来说，每一种新的精灵都是无价的。
More options is rarely a downside, now is it?

Indeed? Perhaps when I am less busy I’ll collect data from trainers who have witnessed these creatures in battle personally.

I recently caught this peculiar Sentret. Perhaps we could battle?

很好，你如果不介意，我会把这场对战记录下来。
Would you agree to a quick battle, then?
要来一场快速对决吗？
Well fought.
打得好！
It certainly is a peculiar creature, isn’t it? That eye-like structure isn’t a sensory organ – at least not in the traditional sense.
这种生命的确很神奇对吧？那个像眼睛一样的结构不是传统意义上的视觉器官。
It projects psychic force and enables some kind of limited telepathy.
它可以将精神力量投射到现实，并实现某种程度上的心灵感应。
What pressures could cause such an adaptation…? Perhaps some manner of Fighting-type predator?
是什么样的环境压力才促使它们产生了这种适应性呢...？也许是某种格斗属性的捕食者?
Ah, but forgive me for wasting your time.
啊，不好意思浪费你时间了。
Here, take these. Perhaps you’ll do some field research of your own, eh?
给，拿着这些吧，这样你自身也能进行实地调查了。
I’ve heard of a pair of Makyan Pokémon on the <imp>banks of the Eleig River</imp>.
我听说在<imp>埃利格河附近</imp>还有一些马凯亚特有的地区形态。

Not yet.
还没。
I have.
我抓到了。
And fought with them.

My Pokemon is mad at me for being such a couch potato.
我的精灵跟我闹矛盾了，因为我总是长在沙发里。

Hmm... maybe it's time to find a Ghost-type Pokemon.

OK, stick with me on this one: y'know Helena? She's, what, in her forties?
嘿，你听我说：你认识海伦娜吗？她大概四十多岁对吧?
So that means she was in her thirties when she was some Team Chasm bigshot. What'd she do before that?

Rangers approaching the situation are advised to be in parties of no smaller than two.
当地的护林员至少得保证两人一组，绝不能单独行动。
Inexperienced Trainers are recommended to avoid the area.

Trainers looking to acquire the Patience and Perseverance Badges are recommended to travel via Grouz or Svait.

Rangers patrolling Grouz have observed strange sightings of a potential four-legged avatar.
在古治镇巡逻的护林员发现了1个4条腿的奇怪化身。
While previous patrols have confirmed the existence of avatar activity in the area, this particular sighting is rather unique.
的确当地的确早就有其他化身活动的痕迹，但这次发现的化身格外不同。
Every avatar sighted in the area has been confirmed as Steel-type, and all known four-legged Steel-type Pokemon are too slow to match observed movement.

A local living in the area has reported multiple strange sightings in the surrounding area.
当地的居民报告称，曾多次在周围看到奇怪的景象。
The proximity of his home to Gigalith's Guts makes his case plausible, but his reports don't seem to match the avatars known to be in the area.
目击位置与怪岩肠道很近，使得此次报告的可信度增加，但他对化身的描述却并不寻常。
Notably, he has also reported sighting two different Pokemon. The sighting locations and timings from other reports corroborate his story.
根据 现场的破坏迹象，可以推出是由一只强大的化身所为。
The destruction left at the sites of each sighting suggest an incredibly powerful avatar.
但目击者却声称看到了两只种类完全不同的精灵。
Rangers looking to confirm these reports are advised to be in parties of no smaller than two.
建议前去调查的护林员，务必保证成编制出动！

TV here is so dull.
这里的电视也忒无聊了。
Nothin' but trashy dramas and fretting about avatars.
除了烂俗的肥皂剧和对化身的瞎操心以外，没有半分钱看头。
I wish I brought my laptop.
为啥出门时不带着笔记本电脑呢...

The Alolan Rattata seems to really appreciate that you saved it.
阿罗拉小拉达似乎很感激你救了它。
It must have been left here by its owner and then chased by the avatar of Arbok.

It seems like it wants you to catch it.
它好像想让你抓住它。

This place is LuxTech's Cold Storage Facility.
这里是光华是的冷藏设施。
It serves two functions.
大致有2个功能。
The first is to cut server running costs by keeping the hardware at low temperatures.
一是通过让硬件保持在低温来缩减服务器运行的成本。
The second is to act as a physical storage area for frozen products.
二是充当冷冻产品的存储区。
Occasionally a Pokemon will fail out of our cold survival training course.
但是有些时候，我们会收到一些无法适应这里工作的精灵。
This Sewaddle didn't make it through.
这只虫宝包显然就是其中之一，它根本不会制冷。
I need a Pokemon that'll definitely fill the slot.
我需要一只能制造冰块或者能使周围降温的精灵。
Pretty much any Ice-type should do. If you have one, I'll trade you for it.
基本所有冰属性精灵都行，要是你有的话，我会拿它跟你换。
Well, not like it's going anywhere.
好吧，反正它不会跑掉。
Hmm. Come back if you manage to get an Ice-type.
你要是抓到冰属性精灵，就回来找我们吧。
Great, let's get this started.
太好了，让我们开始吧。
Time to put this guy to work! Thanks!

This Pokemon is going to be cooling rooms like nobody's business.
这只精灵能够让房间保持低温。
I train and manage the Pokemon here who act as living conditioning units.
我在这里训练和管理精灵，它们就跟空调似的为房间调温。
It's certainly a lot of work.

I have to make sure they get regular breaks and food throughout the day.

I'm the director of operations here. The lead system administrator.
我是这里的运营主任，也是主要系统管理员。
You would think that they would put me in a better office, but no.
你是不是以为他们会给我安排1个更好的办公室，但实际上并没有。
Apparently my "expertise" means I need to be "on- site"..."at all times"...
貌似我的“主任”头衔就是“主动加班”的主和...“任劳任怨”的任...
Ugh. At least the Pokemon here keep me company.
啊，至少还有精灵陪着我。
Most of our servers are in here, but some of the older ones we keep in a room in the lower level.
大部分服务器都在这里了，但一些较为古老的则在底层。
It's pretty dark and dingy. I try to go there as little as possible.
那里又黑又乱，我是不想去。

The Seel seems distressed. It gives you and the worker nervous glances.
这只小海狮好像很焦虑，它不安地瞥了你和工人几眼。
It probably just wants to get out of here. Being stuck in a shipping crate didn't help.
它可能只是想离开这里，被困在货运箱里可不好受。
It doesn't seem like it will try to fight if you catch it.
如果你想抓住它，它或许不会反抗。
Would you like to use a Pokeball?

The rangers at Velenz requested a shipment of food.

I have their whole order here, but there's an extra thing inside.
我拿到了他们的订单，但里面多了一样奇怪的东西。
Someone must have slipped it in here while no one was looking.
一定是某人趁别人不注意时悄悄放进去的。
Take this, you look like you'll put it to good use.
拿着这个吧，看样子它对你能派上用场。
I'm not even sure if everything in here needs to be stored at cold temperatures...
我怀疑这些东西并不是都需要低温保存...
Well, I suppose it's not my place to ask questions.
好吧，我想这不是我该问的问题。
Hey, mind coming over here for a moment?
嘿，你能过来一下吗？
This Seel was stuck in one of the crates. No idea how.
这只小海狮不知怎么的，被跟着箱子运进来了。
It seems really scared, so...while we could just put it to work here in Cold Storage, I think it'd be more humane to get it out of here.
它看起来很害怕，所以...虽然我可以让它在这里工作，但还是找人带它离开更好一些。
You're a Trainer, right? Do you think you could take it in?
你是训练师，对吧？你愿意收留它吗?
Thanks for allowing that Seel to go with you.
感谢你给了它1个家。
It must have been quite the adventurous type to stow away in our shipment like that.

Hello stranger.
你好，陌生人。
Are you here to find the gym leader as well? He has been quite elusive.
你也是来找道馆馆主的么？他向来都是神龙见首不见尾。
I have come here to meditate. Doing so in such a place brings me peace.
我特来此地，是为了坐禅。在此等胜境参悟，必使我心神得以安定。
You are free to take the seat next to me, if you would like.
如果你有心的话，尽可安坐我旁的座席。
That was... strange.
这真是...玄之又玄。
Whatever had caused that nightmare seems to be gone now.
无论是什么邪祟引起了那场惊梦，如今似乎都不知所终了。
I'm guessing that you're the reason for that.
我料想你就是那个缘由。
Perhaps we may finally be able to meditate in peace.

It seems that I should give you a token of my gratitude.

You've more than proven that you are worthy of it.
你已经证明了你与它的缘分。
Best of luck, friend.

The last thing I remember was...
我记得的最后一件事...

You feel your eyes close again, though you don't remember closing them.
你感觉眼睛又闭上了，可你怎样都想不起究竟是何时闭上的。
I...

I'm not sure where we are.
我不清楚我们在哪里。
We were back at the house a moment ago, right?
我们刚才还在屋子里，对吧？
It's cold, and I can't find my Pokemon anywhere...
好冷啊，我找不到我的精灵了...
Can you just...
你能不能...
Give me some space...
让我单独思考下状况...
Why hello there traveller!
嗨旅行者，你好啊!
Can you sense those spirits around you?
你能察觉到周围的那些鬼魂吗？
They watch us all the time from their little hidey-holes.
它们总是躲在各个角落里死死地盯着我们。
They seem quite angry at you. Why would you do such a thing to upset them?
它们对你的怨气很大。你到底做了什么事才惹怒了它们?
Are you lost?
你迷路了吗？
That's too bad. Maybe you'll be stuck here too.
这下麻烦大了，搞不好你永远都出不去了，和大家一起困在这鬼地方。

It looks like the machine is dead. You can't heal your Pokemon here.
这台机器好像坏了，你无法在这里治疗你的精灵。
The PC is dead. You can't access your storage from here.

I'll take your Pokémon for a few seconds.
请允许我暂时拿走您的精灵。
Hehe. Just kidding.
哈哈，骗到你了！
[Map103]
I am going to be very honest with you.
我受不了了！
The whole searching for the gym leader ordeal has been the last straw.
我真的受够了，我不想再四处寻找道馆馆主了！
I don't want to compete in Makya anymore. I want to go somewhere that has a sane Pokemon League.
我不想再参加马凯亚锦标赛了，我要去一些正常点的地区，继续我的精灵联盟旅程。
Like Unova. Or Sinnoh. Sinnoh sounds nice.
比如说合众或者神奥...神奥感觉挺不错的。
I caught this Magby for one reason -- to beat this gym.
之前我抓这只鸭宝宝...就是为了打倒这个道馆。
Since I'm no longer trying, I want to trade it for something else.
现在我用不着它了，我打算用它交换其他的精灵。
I want a Shinx. I love how they look and I want something that's popular in Sinnoh.
我想要一只小猫怪，它们非常和我的喜好，而且在神奥地区也很流行（可在箱子里选择精灵）。
Sure, whatever.
行吧，随便你。
Come back if you do find a Shinx.
你要是真找到了小猫怪再过来吧。
Nice, maybe this'll motivate me once I land in Sinnoh.
很好，等我到了神奥地区，这或许能成为我前进的动力
Finally, now I can get out of this dump.

Andris gave each of us -- us gym leaders -- one of these keys.
安德里斯给了馆主们各一把钥匙。
They’re for these doors, these prisons.
都是这些门...这些监狱的钥匙。
Behind all that bluster about Champions and badges and all that, this is our real purpose. At least, it’s supposed to be.
在接受挑战、颁发徽章等表象背后，但这才是我们真正的使命。也是事情本来的样貌。
Seems like I’m the only one taking this seriously.
看起来只有我是最认真的那个。
So, please, take this key, go through that door, and get rid of that thing.
所以请拿着这把钥匙，通过那扇门，把那个东西消灭掉。
You gonna go after the avatar? Until it’s gone, I can’t leave... just in case.
你要去找化身吗？只有它消失了，我才能离开...
Just. In. Case.
务必小心。
You’re back? Really? I mean, fine, but please stop.
真的假的？你回来了？我的意思是，随便了，但还是就此打住吧。
Another challenger? How inhospitable does this place have to get before you lunatics give up?
又来个挑战者？这个地方究竟要变成什么样，你们这些疯子才会放弃？
Do I look like I have the time to duel you? That isn’t my job, you know.
我看起来像有时间和你战斗吗？你也知道，这不是我的职责。
My job is to guard this door until I can find someone strong enough to defeat what’s inside.
我的职责就是守护这扇门，直至寻到足够强大的人来打倒里面的东西。
And for some insane reason they thought sending a parade of children at me was a good way to do that.
但是我不知道他们是怎么想的，竟然觉得派来一群孩子就能搞定。
But fine. We’ll fight.
行行行，那我们就打一场。
I run doubles, and doubles only. You ready for that?
我这边是双打比赛，而且只有双打，准备好了？
Great. Maybe I can get some soil samples today.
行吧。也许我今天可以采集一些土壤样本。
I used to be a scientist, you know...
你知道吗，我以前是一名科学家...
You’ve got the aura of someone with real audacity.
你身上有一种敢作敢为的气质。
The only reason I’m here is to find a true Pokémon master, and you’ve at least got the ferocity fighting your way to me.
我来这里的唯一原因是找到一位真正的精灵大师，而你在与我对战的过程中所展现出的激烈攻势，也算符合了我的要求。
Fine. You’re here for more than an easy badge.
很好，我明白了。你来这里可不仅仅是为了枚徽章。
Show me what you got.
让我看看你有什么本事。
Sure thing. The sooner I lose to you, the sooner you get out of here and back somewhere safe, I suppose.
当然，你输的越快，就可以越早地离开这里。
Do it.
来吧。
Finally. How many years and I finally – it’s done! It’s done!
终于，多少年了！我终于...等到了！等到了！

I hope you’re happy.

Suicidal dive into dangerous territory, hunt me down, force me to waste time fighting you.
冒着生命危险到这种地方来找我，逼我浪费时间和你战斗。
And for what, a big old game?
这一切都是为了什么，一场老掉牙的游戏吗？
Take your badge.
拿走你的徽章吧。
And, yeah, I’m not angry with you, got it? I’m angry with Helena and Andris and everyone for setting this up.
我没有生你的气。我是在生海伦娜、安德里斯，以及所有决策层的气。
Now get outta here, ‘kay?
现在可以走了吗？
Please, let's not do this right now.
拜托，别再来了。
When the tournament is on, it's the only time of the year I can take a break from handling crazy trainers all day.

There’s a newly-painted sign here.
这里有个挺新的路牌。
It reads “Rafael gone. Connor is gym leader now?”
上面写着“拉斐尔走了，新馆主为康纳？？？？？”
There are many, many question marks.
后面跟着一长串问号。
An old combination lock keeps the door shut tight.
一把老式的密码锁将门紧紧地锁住了。
Reading off the slips of paper you found, you enter the code onto the locks.
你看着找到的纸条，输入着上面的密码。
After a bit of jostling, the lock opens!
轻轻地晃动一下，锁就打开了！
It takes eight digits, but with enough finagling you'd be able to open it with just <imp>four</imp>.
需要输入8位数字，但是只要耍点小聪明，只要有<imp>4</imp>位数字就可以穷举了。
Oh, heya.
哦，你好。
So... I'm a gym leader now. I guess.
所以...我就是道馆馆主...现在...大概...吧...
Didn't even really expect to see Rafeal again. He just kinda climbed down, patted me on the shoulder, and told me.
没想到再见到拉斐尔后，他只是轻轻地拍了拍我的肩膀...
Said all the paperwork or whatever was done. So, uh... yeah.
说所有的文件都办好了...然后...呃...我就...
Gym Leader Connor is coming soon!
总之，我现在是道馆馆主康纳。
Just need to get a proper doubles team together...
现在得试着组建一支适合双打的队伍...
WHOA!
哇！
WHAT KIND'A UGLY POKEMON ARE YA?!
你 是 什 么 东 西 ？
Rafael told me to battle any avatar that might come through here.
拉斐尔告诉我要跟所有通过这里的化身战斗。
I forgot my glasses at home today so I can't see anything more than a foot in front of me.
今天又忘了带眼镜，所以看什么都很模糊。
Sorry for confusing you with a Pokemon, you can pass through.
抱歉把你和精灵搞混了，你可以过去了。
Rafael is up ahead. Though, the door to the front is locked.
拉斐尔就在前面，不过，前门被锁住了。
If you want in, you'll need the combo code. I wrote the digits on some slips of paper, but lost 'em a while back.
如果你想进去，就需要输入密码。我把密码写在一些纸条上，但前阵子弄丢了。
Sorry, but if you want in to fight Rafael, you'll have to find those slips.
抱歉，如果你想和拉斐尔较量，就得先找到那些纸条。
The lock is really old, so you only need half of the eight digits, I'd wager.
当然如果你愿意动动脑，或许并不需要找到所有密码。
Rafael's Pokemon League Representative quit years ago, so I'll have to brief you on his team.
拉斐尔已经不做联盟代表好多年了，所以我得向你介绍一下他的队伍。
Rafael uses a mix of Grass and Ghost-type Pokemon.
他喜欢用的是草和幽灵属性的精灵。
This means that Fire, Flying, Ice, and Dark types do well here.
这就说明火、飞行、冰和恶4种属性可以在这里大展身手。
He's not just his types, however. He wouldn't have been able to guard this place for so long without a trick up his sleeve.
不过他对属性并没有那么依赖，能在这里担任这么久的馆主，多少都是有一些绝招的。
His team is built around the Dancer ability.
据说他的队伍核心是舞者特性。
When you see him send out his Bellossom or his Alolan Marowak...
等你看到他派出美丽花或者阿罗拉嘎啦嘎啦时...
Well, all I'm saying is be prepared.
嗯，我只能说，好好准备吧。
Best of luck, friend.
祝你好运，朋友。
You managed to win against Rafael?
你战胜了拉斐尔？
Great work, you got some real grit.
干得漂亮，你真有实力。
If the avatar problem here ever gets sorted out, I'll try to go watch your next high profile match live.
等这里的化身问题都搞定了，我就去现场观看你下场比赛。
Well I'll be damned.
我这是见鬼了么。
After all this time, I finally got to see Rafael leave his post.
这么长时间了，第1次看到拉斐尔离开他的岗位。
He had the biggest damn smile I've ever seen on him.
他脸上露出了迄今为止我见过的最灿烂的笑容。
You did good.
你做得很好。
You've probably saved me and Rafael a lot of cash as well.
这或许能帮我们节省一些资金。
We're down here most of the time, so we've lost a lot of money getting food delivered to us.
由于我们大部分时间都在这里，所以花了很多钱来运送食物。
Helena would probably kill us if she found out how much we've spent on delivery fees...

这里的化身也太多了，我到底得怎样才能拿到徽章？
Man, if regular trainers are destroying me, no way I'm gonna beat the Gym Leader.
如果普通的训练师都能打败我，那我肯定打不过道馆馆主。
I have no idea where the Gym Leader is, but I do know one thing.
我不知道道馆馆主在哪里，但我清楚地知道一件事。
Avatars are scary!

Now go, before somebody overhears.

你在找道馆馆主吗？我只听说过一些他的传言。
Apparently he's shacked up in one of the buildings.
说是他一直躲在一栋建筑里。
Dunno which one though.
但我不知道是哪一栋。
Well. I'll just be here. Chilling. Yeah.

又是你...是那个冒牌货的护身符保护了你？
My name – our name – is <imp>Imogene</imp>.
我的名字...我们的名字...是<imp>伊莫珍</imp>。
The Ditto is around here somewhere, I imagine. I can’t ever lose her.
那个百变怪就在这附近，我想我们都不会失去彼此。
We were wandering Kalos before deciding to come home to Makya.
我们之前在卡洛斯游历，后来决定回到马凯亚。
If we can settle this matter of identity anywhere, it will be here.
这里应该是我们唯一，能分清谁真谁假的地方。
And as for this cave, I have a request.
至于这个洞窟，我有1个请求。
Indeed you can. I did not choose this barren cave at random.
的确需要你的帮助，我并不是随便选了这个地方。
It is a place of power, and I intend to prove myself the real Imogene once and for all.
这是1个拥有能量的地方，至少这1次，我要证明自身是真的伊莫珍。
*sigh*
*叹气*
I am the real Imogene. The other woman that looks like me is my Ditto doppelganger, who claims just the opposite.
我是真正的伊莫珍，那个长得像我一样的女人是我的百变怪分身，当然她的说法完全相反。
And I would like prove her wrong here and now.
我要在这里证明她是错的。
Fire-cracked bones can be read to divine the future. Ice forms a mirror that reflects oneself.
火烧骨可以用来占卜未来，冰则可以形成反映自身的镜子。
Let us combine the two – crater this ice with a duel and see our true identities in the fractures.
让我们把两者结合起来 - 就在这个洞窟里决斗，让我们的真实身份在裂缝中显露。
Not without me you don’t! I’d rather you hex me than try and perform a reading without me!
必须我们一起来完成这一切！我宁愿你施咒诅咒我，也不希望你在没有我参与的情况下进行占卜！
The both of us, against our beloved traveler!
以我们2个，对抗我们心爱的旅行者！
Fine… I’ll hold my horses. But don’t leave us waiting.
好吧...我会等着你的，但不要让我们等太久。
Good! Quail before my inner fire, and reveal your soul to my eye!
好！在我的内心火焰面前屈服，让我看到你的灵魂！

Something about nostalgia, but I think you stepped on that part.
还有很多怀念的...那一部分被你踩到了。
Nothing of use, then. Not to us, at least. I hope our makeshift augury at least did you some good.

啊...我今天感觉不太好，\PN。
Y’know, I’m a fan of yours, gotta admit. Like your style. Like how you move. Like how you fight.
我不得不承认，现在是你的粉丝了，我喜欢你的风格和战斗方式。
Remind me of Yez, more than a li’l. But... I just ain’t feelin’ up to small talk. Today’s a day for big happenings, y’see?
你总是让我想到叶泽拉...不过今天我不打算闲聊，毕竟有一件大事正在发生，对吧？
Sure hope so. It ain’t exactly subtle. So, now, let’s figure this out 'tween you and me.
那就好，现在可不太妙，现在就由我们来解决它吧。
Which of us is better, who’s gonna be the one going down there, the whole shebang.
看看我们谁是那个最后解决掉一切的人。
You even gotta ask ‘bout that? Y’know how this goes. Always.
你连这都需要问我？你明明知道发生了什么。
Ain’t no other way for us folks. We got somethin’ to figure out: which one of us is gonna have to give Yez a talking-to.
我们没别的办法了，必须得找个机会，无论是你也好，我也罢，跟叶泽拉好好谈谈。
Oh, don’tcha go callin’ it a crush. Just got a lot of traits I’m half-partial to.
呃...这可不是那种“喜欢”，我只是欣赏你身上的某些性情。
Ain’t 'bout to change what we gotta do. One of us gotta go down there.
先别说这些了，正事要紧，我们当中必须有人下到最后。
I’m her friend. You’re her... well, you’re a lotta things.
我是她的朋友，而你...呃...你有很多身份。
I figure you got a better chance of beating her than I do, but I gotta double-check.
而且我觉得你比我更有机会打败她，不过现在我得再确认一下。
Aw, who am I kiddin’? I’m nervous, kid. I ain’t got the guts to face her and tell her what needs sayin’.
我不是在开玩笑，小家伙，我现在其实很紧张，我也不太确定该怎样面对她。
So c’mon. Gimme an excuse to give up.
所以，给我个放弃的借口。
Figured if there was one thing ya could do, it’d be this.
这就是我的理解之中，你能做到的事。
Hah! Knew I liked you.
哈哈，我果然很喜欢你的风格。
Nah. Never could say no to her, not when it mattered.
不，我怕我在关键时刻，无法狠下心来拒绝她。
You let me know when you’re 'bout ready, and we’ll do this. Ain’t no two ways about it.
准备好了就告诉我吧，这件事没得商量！
Take your time and make it good. I wanna be facin’ the whole nine yards, y’hear?
慢慢来，不着急，说不定关二爷还会给你9个圣杯呢！
Ah, good. Prove me right. Show me I ain’t nothin’.
很好，证明你比我更合适吧。
But, uh, I ain’t ‘bout to go down easy. \PN, meet the team I’ve been honing since the good ol’ days. Meet Drag-Mag.
不过...呃...我是不会轻易认输的，\PN，来见识一下我这些年的积累，以及曾经的特工“狂风”吧。
...'Bout figures.
...就是这样。
Well, I ain’t gonna sugarcoat it: it’s your job now. Always was, lookin’ at it a certain kinda way.
我不想粉饰什么太平，现在这是你的工作。
Go down there. Talk some sense into her. Y’know how. Ain’t much else to say, is there?
到下面去跟她讲讲道理，你知道该怎么做，不需要我多说了对吧？
You know whatcha gotta do. Don’t need me holdin’ your hand. Good kid.
你应该知道要怎么做，小家伙，你不需要我牵着你的手。
Oh, don’tcha go thankin’ me yet. I ain’t done nothin’ for ya. Nothin’ material.
哈，不用谢我，我什么都没为你做过，至少现在还是这样。
I was plannin’ to.
我当然也会出一份力。
I ain’t ‘bout to go down there myself with ya – it’s a private affair. Can’t ruin my reputation by barging on in and making a muck of things.
但我不想亲自跟你下去...我不想毁了自身的招牌，闯进去大闹一番，却最终把结果推向更糟。
Hah. Don’t embarrass me. Maybe after all’s said and done, we can grab a drink together.
哈哈，别让我难堪，或许等一切结束之后，我可以请你一起去喝一杯。
You, me, Yez... or just you and me, if that’s your drift.
你，我，还有叶泽拉...当然如果你想的话，也可以只有我们2个。
Just don’tcha go being one of those folks asking me to step on ‘em. Hah!
但你可别表现得像那些被我踩扁的讨厌家伙一样，哈哈！
You’re gonna need a li’l help to get to tomorrow, though.
为了明天，这是我对你的资助。
Take my Heatran. I don’t see myself fightin’ too many wars in my near future, and for anythin’ less my regulars will do well enough.
把我的席多蓝恩带走吧，将来我可能不会再打硬仗了，平时，一般的精灵也就够了。
You, though? You oughta take anything you can get.
你觉得呢？我不觉得你会拒绝这份提议。
Take good care of that damn thing, y’hear? We go way back.
好好照顾那个鬼东西，哈哈，怎么说也是老伙计了。
And, besides, it’s a damn juggernaut that can wreak more carnage than a babyface like you can even imagine.
别小看这个巨无霸，它所能造成的破坏，绝对远超你这“娃娃脸”的想象。
Hah! I ain’t never been able to tell if you’re brave or stupid. In my experience, they ain’t much different.
哈哈，我一直都分辨不出，你到底是勇敢还是愚蠢，虽说以我的经验，这两者没区别。
As you say, though. Ain’t gonna complain 'bout keepin’ an extra ace up my sleeve.
当然，我当然不会抱怨，自身手里能多留一张王牌。
Well, I s’pose we oughta keep it brief, all things considered. You gotta go hunt that girl down, and I gotta go prep for either which way it ends.
我们还是长话短说，去追上那个女孩吧，而我得为一切可能的结局做准备。
I’ll be seein’ her soon, one way or another. Probably won’t be too keen on seein’ me, but that’s friends for ya.
不管怎样，我很快就会见到她...当然她可能不太想见到我吧，但这就是朋友，哈哈！
Hey, \PN, I figure this comes as an awful surprise to you, but I got a secret.
对了，\PN，你可能...会对我接下来，所说的这个秘密感到惊讶。
Up until now, I’ve been workin’ with Yez, clandestine-like. Masked, causin’ havoc, fightin’ you. I ain’t proud of it, but it ain’t far from my usual.
其实在此之前，我一直在跟叶泽拉合作...那些...制造混乱也好，和你对决也罢...这与我的一贯作风差别不大，但我不会以此为荣。
I’m a black ops gal born and raised, though I’m a mite more on the side of cut-and-burn than cloak-and- dagger.
我是1个在这里土生土长的探员，虽然我更擅长暴力解决对手，而不是戴上面具做1个忍者。
I ain’t 'bout to apologize. But, uh, Yez’d have me stoppin’ you, and I ain’t 'bout to play that game.
我不会为这些事情道歉的，但是...呃...叶泽拉肯定会让我阻止你，我却不想再玩这种游戏了。
She got other lackeys, good on her, but I ain't gonna be one of 'em.
她还有其他的支持者，但我不会再是其中之一了。
Go ruin her day, kid. I’ll see you around.
去给她当头一棒吧，回头见，小家伙。
Hey, next time I see ya, drinks are on me. Call it my way of making up to you. Heh. So long, kid.
对了，别忘了下次见面的邀约，一起去喝一杯，就当是补偿了，再见！
\PN, go ruin her day. I wish I was good enough to do it myself, but I just ain’t.
\PN，去毁了她的计划吧，我当然也想亲自这样做，但...我还是狠不下心...
You understand her well enough. She’ll listen to you, one way or the other.
你很了解她不是吗？起码她多少会听你的话。
And, uh, sorry. For makin’ this all ‘bout her. If things were any different, I’d love to chat ‘bout other things.
而且...呃...对不起，如果没有这一档子事的话，我倒是很乐意跟你聊些别的。
Maybe some day, yeah? I’ll see you around, I promise.
或许会有能放下一切的一天...回头再见吧，我保证会来找你。
You come back and there’s still bars left in the world, drinks are on me, y’hear? See ya around, kid.
如果等你回来之后，这个世界的酒馆还在，那我们就去喝一杯吧，走了，小家伙！

...But that must come later.
...不过那必须稍后再说。
\PN. I had planned to propose to you here. But then I was gifted a miracle.
\PN，我本想在这里向你求婚，但1个奇迹打破了我原本的计划。
My undying, fervent wish was made real before my eyes. Our love was consecrated in the eyes of the heavens.
我那不朽与热烈的愿望，就这样在眼前变成了现实，是我们的爱得到了天堂的祝福。
I knew this gift to us was to be used only one way. You are like Yezera: there’s one language you speak above all others.
不过这份礼物的包装，只有一种拆解方式，那就是你和叶泽拉一样，最擅长的那种语言。
I’ve been so selfish, using my words to express how wonderful you are. I should’ve been speaking your language.
我一直都那么自私，自顾自地用干瘪的语言表达你的美好，我应该换一种你能听懂的方式。
Let me show you my love. Let me show you the sign I have received. Let our love be made immortal by this glorious omen, shining in the passions of combat.
让我展示我的爱吧，让我展示我所接收到的征兆，让我们的爱因这个光荣的征兆而不朽，在战斗的激情中闪耀。
Of course, my love. Make yourself ready.
当然，我的爱人，我也不希望你是仓促应战。
I love you. Allow me to show you just how much.
我爱你。让我向你展示这份爱的浓郁吧。
...I won’t let you slip away. You’re mine, \PN.
...我不会让你溜走的，你是我的，\PN。
You don’t understand what I mean yet. Let me show it to you. Let me open your eyes to the love you’ve been missing.
你还不明白我的意思吗？让我毫不保留地展示给你看吧，让我揭开你一直缺失的爱的眼帘。
This is meant to be. Witness the message the heavens gave me.
这是命中注定的，是所见证的上天给我的信息。
You’re making me wait. My heart is pounding. I can’t wait any longer. Will you now bear witness to this sign of our eternal love?
在等待的过程中，我的心一直怦怦跳动，我再也等不了了，来见证我们永恒爱情的征召吧！
Do you see it? The wish-bringer, come to grant me my wish! The light of our love shining through it! And you, like a star, like an avatar!
你看到了吗？愿望的化身来实现我的期盼了！我们的爱之光因为它闪耀！而你，像一颗星星，1个化身般闪耀！
I wanted Yezera, and I sought the avatars, all to lead me here. To woo a god, and make you mine forever.
无论是叶泽拉，还是化身，我追求他们，都是为了今天，让命运把我带到这里的一刻。追寻神的步伐，让你永远属于我。
Can’t you see? I will do anything for you.
你应该能看得出来吧？我会为你做任何事情。
I will move heaven and earth. I will love you eternally. I will smother you in compassion and affection. I will fill your life with comfort and pleasure.
我会永远爱你，我会为你移山填海，披荆斩棘，我会用关怀和爱意淹没你，让你的生活只剩舒适和愉悦。
I will steal for you. Kill for you. End this world for you, or remake it to be more pleasant for you. So long as you are mine.
我会为了你成为窃贼，为你杀戮，为你毁灭世界，又或者重塑世界，使其更美好，只要你能属于我...
So long as I can hold you, and love you, and know that you are mine and no one else’s.
只要我能拥抱你，爱你，并确保你是我的，不是其他什么人的...
I need help? That’s all you can say to me?
我需要治疗？这就是你要对我说的全部？
I love you more than anyone has loved anything! Do you expect me to keep it inside, wear masks, be... civil about it?
我爱你胜过任何人，胜过任何事物！你希望我把它藏在心里，戴上面具，表现得...文明些？
It drives me to madness and back not embracing you here and now! As it should! Everyone else is blind not seeing your radiance!
无法现在拥抱你会让我疯掉！这才是最该有的结果！其他人都瞎了，看不到你的光辉！
You are gorgeous and brilliant and divine. What higher accomplishment could there be than to make you mine?
你那么美丽、聪明、神圣，让你成为我的，就是此世间最珍贵的成就！
No one could aspire to anything better, except to be you.
除了成为你之外，没有人能找到更好的追求。
I would for you. Don’t you understand that?
为了你，我愿意下地狱，你难道还不明白吗？
Why would you reject me? I could make your life perfect!
你为什么要拒绝我？我可以让你的生活变得完美！
I would do anything for you, and you want to throw that away? Simply because I ask for your love in return? Am I not worthy of that, after everything?
我愿意为你做任何事情，而你却想要抛弃我？仅仅因为我要求你回报我的爱？在经历了这一切之后，我难道不值得被爱吗？
I am kind, and loving, and caring, and humble, and I can see your real worth!
我善良、谦虚、有爱心，也懂得关怀别人，还能看到你真正的价值！
Shouldn’t I be more worthy of love than anyone else? Do you think I’m insane?
难道我不比任何人都更值得被爱吗？你认为我疯了吗？
You’re the mad one here if you think you’ll be better off without me. A beautiful mad god that refuses to be helped...
你认为没有我会更好？哈哈，原来是你疯了，1个美丽的疯狂之神，拒绝接受信徒的帮助...
No! I will have you alone. I couldn’t stand to share you with anyone else!
不！你只能有我1个人，我无法忍受与其他人分享你！
Please, you won’t even notice. I will fill your days with joy. You won’t need anyone else.
求求你，你可能没注意到，我会让你的生活充满快乐，你不再需要其他任何人。
If they ask for you, if they want you, I’ll take care of them. They can serve you – us – or they can leave. Our perfect days need no one else.
如果他们需要你，如果他们想要你，我会代你照顾他们。他们可以为你，为我们...服务，或者离开，我们完美的生活不再需要任何人。
After all, I’m the only one that feels this raging love. I’m the only one that knows what you really are. Radiant. Divine.
毕竟，只有我能感受到这股炽烈的爱，只有我知晓你真正的本质，那份光辉与神圣！
Yes. Of course. Hah! Everything is as it should be.
没错，就是这样，哈哈！一切就应该这样发展！
The entire world is falling into place, my love. You are mine. Forever.
整个世界都在我手手中了，我的爱人，你是我的，永远！
Love, I’ve been working with Yezera to reset the world. I planned to rule with her, and then later I planned to make it a paradise for us two.
亲爱的，我之前一直在和叶泽拉一起重置世界，我原本计划和她一起统治，再为我们2个打造1个天堂的。
But now? You’re fighting Yezera, and I’ll gladly choose you over her. She’s nothing to me now. You’re the only one that matters.
但现在，你是她的对立面，我也很乐意选择你而不是她，她对我来说已经毫无意义了，你是唯一重要的人。
How about this? You go take care of her and make sure she never bothers us. Meanwhile, I’ll be making preparations.
怎么样？你去解决掉她，确保她不会再来打扰我们吧，同时，我也会做好准备。
I’ll make your life a dream. A beautiful, idyllic, paradisiacal dream from which you’ll never wake up. Go do what you do best.
我会让你拥有梦境般的生活，1个美丽、闲适的梦境，你永远都不需要醒来的梦境。而现在，继续去做你擅长的事吧。
Oh, the plans I have. My love, just you wait. Please. Don’t hurry yourself. Although... you must have work to attend to.
我有数不清的计划，我的爱人，在等等吧，请不要着急，而且...你还有些事情要处理。
Oh, please, continue then. I wouldn’t dare take you away from what you do best.
请继续吧，我不会让你停下那些。
I need time to prepare, and you need to wrap up these loose ends. Cut these threads away. You don’t need anyone else now.
我需要时间来准备未来，而你需要结束这一些的源头，当变故被全部切断之后，你就不再需要任何人了。
\PN, I’m going to make your life a dream. You’re a god... and now you’re mine.
\PN，我会让你的生活变成一场美好的梦境，现在...你就是独属于我的神明了。
We’ll be together forever. Forever’s just beginning, and I’m a patient man.
我们将永远在一起，不...永远也只是开始，我是1个有耐心的人。
So go ahead. Get rid of Yezera. Get rid of everyone! And then come back to me, so I can hold you.
所以继续吧，摆脱叶泽拉，摆脱其他所有人！然后回到我身边，让我拥抱你。
Here. Take Jirachi with you. A sign of my undying love, and our divine bond.
不如，带上基拉祈，这是我永恒的爱和我们之间神圣连结的象征。
I love you, \PN. My gift to you is a god, because what else could suffice?

No? Oh, \PN, you don’t have to leave it with me.
你不打算带走它？\PN，你没必要把它留给我。
If it isn’t good enough for you, I’ll make it up to you. Anything you desire, you’ll have. Just let me work out the details, alright?
如果你觉得这份礼物还不够，我将来会再补偿你的，无论你想要什么我都会给你，让我来处理这些，好吗？
You’re gorgeous. You’re perfect beyond words. And you’re mine. All mine.
你的美，无与伦比，而且你是我的，全部都是我的。
So go on. We can be apart for a little while more. I’ll be thinking of you every second you’re away.
现在继续你的旅程吧，我们可以再分开一段时间，我每一秒都会想念你。
I’ve got preparations to make. Time to set aside, items to procure, people to... obviate.
接下来我要做好一切的准备，安排时间、采购物品、处理麻烦...
We’ll meet again. And then we’ll never meet again, because we’ll never be apart.
等我们再次相遇，就永远不会再分开，因为...这就是我永恒的爱！
Goodbye, \PN. I love you more than anything in the world.
再见，\PN，我爱你胜过世间一切。

You’re leaving me? Why?
你要离开我？为什么？
I was going to create a perfect world for you. Do you know that?
你知道吗？我本来要创造1个属于我们的完美世界！
Yezera wants a new world. I don’t care why. It gave me the perfect canvas. An ancient, divine land. A golden age! And this time it’d never end!
叶泽拉想要1个新的世界，我不在乎她的目的，但这给了我一块完美的画布，给了我古老而神圣的土地！我可以让黄金时代永不终结！
I would have her... or you.
我会拥有她...或者你。
I served her whims here, helping her, fighting you, stealing the titans. And I would serve her in the reborn world, love her forever.
我本在那里为她服务，帮助她与你战斗，偷走巨人...在重生的世界里，我也会继续为她服务，永远爱她。
But now that you have shone upon me, I couldn’t ever go back to her. She pales in comparison. So now no one will receive this endless love.
但现在你照亮了我，我再也无法回到她身边，她现在已经显得没那么美好了...所以现在没有人能得到我这份无尽的爱。
I will never build a new world for my beloved. And I will never have a god to call mine.
我永远都无法为我所爱的人创造全新的世界了，我永远都无法拥有自身的神了。
...Fine. You’ll regret this. They all will.

You – no!
你...不！

为什么你要给我希望，然后又将它撕碎？为什么你要这样对我？
I have worshiped you! I have loved you! I have always loved you!
我那么崇敬你，那么爱你！一直、一直都是这样！
Gods come to earth, turning their backs on me! Do I deserve this? Have I failed you in a single way?
神明降临人间，却背弃了我！难道我不配吗？我到底是哪里做错了？
No! I am pure, and holy! My love is divine!
不！我是纯洁而神圣的！我的爱是最神圣的！
Fine then! If you want to cast me into darkness, do so. If my love burns too brightly even for the heavens, cast me down.
既然...连你都想将我扔进黑暗，那就这样吧...如果连天堂都无法容纳我的爱，那就将我驱逐吧...
You can’t stop me. You can’t snuff me out. You’ll be mine eventually. One of the gods will.
但你无法阻止我，无法扼杀我的！你，或者是其他神明中的1个，总有1个，总有一天会是我的！
All I need is one to love forever. One to be mine, and mine alone. I won’t stop until I have one to keep.
我只需要1个永远爱我的人，1个属于我...只属于我的人！我会不停地追求，直到拥有...
I love you. I love you more than anything. And I’ll never see you again.
我爱你，我比谁都更爱你，但我再也见不到你了。
Maybe we’ll meet in another eternity, when I have a god of my own to love and care for. And then we’ll see if you regret this.
也许我们会在另1个永恒中相遇，当我拥有自身的神明去爱和照顾时，到时再看看你是否会后悔吧。

How Skyler was blessed by a mythical granter of wishes, you’ll never know.

Jirachi seems highly embarrassed and gladly lets itself be caught. Honestly, it seems like it just wants to forget this ever happened.

Jirachi seems disappointed. You suspect it wanted to be caught and battle some more as a palate cleanser.

As an immortal being, though, it’s got plenty of time to forget this ever happened.

没错，看来你知道内情！
I, like, totally can’t stand the idea of some ex-Team Chasm jerks keeping some Pokémon that prolly still wants to go back home.
我...大概...完全不能接受前裂隙队的成员，强行保留那些想要回家的精灵。
I, uh, guess I maybe kinda should’ve explained that earlier.
我...呃...我应该早点解释清楚的。
But, like, hey, no harm no foul, right? My name’s <imp>Candy</imp>.
但是，大概...嘿嘿，应该没关系吧？我是<imp>糖儿</imp>。
And you’re \PN -- I know, like, everything about you. So, hey, you’re cool. You, uh, want to team up?
我知道你是\PN - 我听说过你的...大概...一切！所以，你，很酷！你愿意跟我合作吗？
Yeaaah, damn straight. Finally got a friend my age. Go Candy!
耶！！！大成功！终于找到1个年龄相仿的朋友了！加油吧，糖儿！
Anyways, I’ll 100% be in touch. So we can inflict some more justice.
总之，我之后100%会跟你联系的，这样我们就能一起为正义而奋斗了。
Sayonara!
再见咯！
Oof. Rejected hard.
哦...被决绝了。
Welp, that’s your loss! Hell, if you keep working with Tamarind and Andris, I might just be your next rival!
行吧，这是你的损失！哼，如果你继续跟塔玛琳或安德里斯他们合作，我就会成为你的下1个对手！
Watch your back!
小心你的脑袋！
The Fossil Research Lab has so many fossils that we're just giving them away!
化石研究所里积累的化石太多了，所以我们经常会送出去一些！
You can pay to get your fossils revived, too.
你也可以使用化石复活技术。
Talk to my associate in the room to our left.
去左边房间里找我的助手就可以了。
The door reads "Authorized personnel only!"
上面写着“无授权不得进入！”
Premise 1: Ice both resists and is super-effective against Ground.
知识点1：冰属性不仅对地面属性强力，还有很强的抵御其攻击的抗性。
Premise 2: Rock both resists and is super-effective against Ice.
知识点2：岩石属性不仅克制冰属性，还可以抵抗冰属性的伤害。
Final premise: Ground is super-effective against Rock.
知识点3：地面属性可以克制岩石属性。
Conclusion: To maintain consistency, Ground must resist Rock!
结论：为了保持均衡，地面属性就得抵抗岩石才对！
The world is just perfectly balanced, isn't it?
真是令人愉悦的均衡，不是吗？
Now I just need to figure out what's going on with Psychic...
现在我只需要再搞明白超能的话...
Dolly here got, uh, reappropriated by Team Chasm... how long has it been? Eight years?
自多莉被裂隙队强征到现在...已经...七八年了吧？
It’s almost surreal seeing her again.
没想到还能再见到她。
Welcome to Novo College!
欢迎来到望新大学！
Feel free to check out any of our labs and classrooms to learn what kind of place we are.
我们的教室和实验室，在正常情况下完全对外开放，您可以随意参观。
You can also log onto the PC over there to read lots about our history, our majors, and other stuff.
如果您想了解我们的历史、研究、录取信息等内容，可以移步一旁的电脑进行查看。
Greetings. I hope you’ve come prepared to answer a few questions.
你好，我能问你几个问题吗？
Thank you. I would like a firsthand account.
谢谢，这对我的调查很有帮助。
Concerning the avatars and their effects.
一些关于化身的问题。
No, but I would appreciate it.
当然不是，我只是在做1个调查。
Understandable. I require more data, however.
我只是希望您能参与调查...
Upon more elaborate consideration, I decided to not have you present our findings with me.
这样吧，我不做过多的讲述了，只是问几个最简单的问题如何？
I think you’ll be glad to hear that. I would like to hear your personal opinions, though.
毕竟每一位受访者，对我来说都是宝贵的数据。
Could you give me an estimate of how many avatars you have fought during your time in Makya?
你能告诉我在马凯亚，一共解决掉多少化身了吗？
Significantly more encounters than the average individual, certainly.
那至少比一般人见得多。
That many? Noted.
这么多？
I have my own estimates based on public records and hearsay. I will default to those.
那我就根据公共数据大致估测一下吧。
Do you take no thrill in defeating these beings? Unfortunately I fear you may be an expert in the matter.
你是不是已经觉得它们没什么挑战性了？听起来你比我想象中经验更为丰富。
So, have you noticed any common traits between avatars?
那你有没有发现它们身上的什么性情？
As the local people have found out.
大家都这么说。
I will trust your judgment, as an experienced battler.
1个经验丰富的战士都这么说，那这个结论的可靠程度会很高。
Ah, yes. I’ve heard of this phenomenon.
啊，对，我也听说过这个事。
I have my suspicions that the true nature of the avatars and Makya’s unique properties share a common origin.
我一直怀疑化身和马凯亚的特有地区形态有同根同源的关系。
The unique ecological pressures that create the Makyan forms must stem from the same source as the avatars. I’m certain of it.
或许迫使它们进化的生存压力，便来源于这些化身。
This region has several pockets of blatantly unnatural climatology – its immense cave network chief among them.
要知道这里有些地方的气候明显不自然，尤其是那些地下洞穴中。
There is more to this region than I have discovered thus far.
想必这片土地上，还有更多人类未曾发现的秘密。
...But, excuse me. I am not asking questions. I am talking your ear off.
而且...呃...抱歉。这已经不是在做调查了，只是没忍住说多了而已。
I need to collect my findings to present to the local experts in regional forms and the ranger captains.
我必须整理好情报和推论，并将其交给教授和护林员军官看看。
I would like to talk with you again. Do you know the <imp>menagerie in Velenz</imp>?
我觉得我们可以展开深度合作。你知道 <imp>夜幽市生态园</imp> 吗？
I would suggest we meet there.
我们在那里见吧。
Though, considering the timing, it would perhaps be better to wait until after the tournament is over. That way at least one burden will be off your mind.
不过，考虑到时间问题...或许可以等到联盟大会结束之后，这样不至于耽误你自身的事情。
In fact, if it may help you in achieving a quick victory, take these.
为了帮你快速取胜，这个就给你了。
Best of luck. Goodbye, \PN.
祝你好运，再见，\PN。
Welcome to the Novo College Informational Site! Please select one of the following subjects to learn more!
欢迎来到望新大学信息站！请选择您要浏览的信息内容！
Makyan paleontology is in an exciting time. Recent excursions have promised field-shaking discoveries.
目前，马凯亚的古生物研究正处于1个关键阶段，一些近期的发现甚至会颠覆学界的普遍认知。
The avatar crisis has only existed for less than half a year, but already fossil analysis has found striking resemblances to ancient Pokemon.
在化身出现的不到半年时间中，根据现在已经掌握的证据和资料，发现其与古代精灵之间有着许多惊人的相似之处。
Skeletons found by researchers are significantly larger than the bone structure of modern counterparts.
其骨骼形态和规模，明显比现代生物更庞大。
Novo College has an accoladed history in the material sciences.
望新大学在材料科学研究上有着悠久的历史。
The Rematerializer was voted by Trainers as one of the most useful inventions in the last decade.
我们发明的重塑打印机被训练师们评选为过去十年中最有用的发明之一。
We also work closely with Pokemon Centers in order to improve medicinal practices.
同时我们还在积极寻求与精灵中的合作，来改善各地的医疗设施。
Makya has a stunningly biodiverse ecosystem, which has raised the mystery of how it got to that point.
马凯亚地区生态系统的多样性，一直是各地学者重点研究的课题。
One theory is that immigration to the region has brought stowaway Pokemon, or foreign Pokemon released into the wild.
部分学者认为，是外来移民带来了本不属于这里的精灵，并因各种原因将其释放到野外。
Another theory is the Makyan environmental policy is particularly effective.
另一部分学者认为，是马凯亚地区出色的生态治理，使得更多生命可以在此繁衍。
For both theories, the counterargument is that fossil records show that Makya has had this biodiversity before human settlements were even founded.
但根据古生物研究，早在有人类定居之前，马凯亚地区的生物种群数量就已经达到了1个很高的数值。
In collaboration with Eko, Novo Town's Gym Leader, Novo College is developing new pain-relief medication for Pokemon.
与诺沃镇的道馆馆主Eko合作，诺沃学院正在开发新的精灵止痛药。
While status-relieving medicine serves a purpose, its main flaw is that it is reactive rather than proactive.
目前市面上的状态类药物，虽也有一定的止痛效果，但一直无法解决不能由精灵自主使用的缺点。
As a response to this issue, the College has been working to develop a new ointment, which can be applied to Pokemon once a day.
为了绕开自主使用的难题，本院校正在努力开发新型药膏，
Unlike existing medicines, it serves to stop status pains before they happen.
与现有药物不同，我们希望新的药品，能在疼痛出现之前便阻断神经元对痛感的反应。
Pokemon in the midst of battle will still feel the effects, long-term pain will be numbed a few minutes after combat.
在对战中的精灵仍然会受到突然刺激型痛感的影响，但可以免除持续型痛感的影响。
Career battling Pokemon benefit most from this, as continued exposure to untreated status can result in chronic pains once the Pokemon retires from battling.
这种药物适用于职业对战精灵，如果对其滥用，导致长时间处于药物作用状态，很可能会使其患上慢性疼痛。
The avatar crisis has disrupted much of Makya's already strained infrastructure, as travel between settlements has become quite dangerous.
化身的出现极大影响了本就不够发达的马凯亚基础设施，城际间的联络也会因此变得危险。
To help combat this, Novo College has been offering free courses to Trainers and Rangers who wish to keep Makyan routes safe.
为了暂时缓解这些问题，望新大学一直在为负责线路安全工作的训练师和护林员提供免费课程。
Multiple professors and students work to develop new strategies to defeat these avatars.
目前有多位教授和学生，正在研究有效对付化身的技巧。
Experienced Trainers with a history of battling avatars are encouraged to volunteer in educational roles.
我们呼吁社会各界有化身对战经验的训练师能够自愿参与此项目。
One of the College's latest projects involved tracking genetic signatures in the Golett, Baltoy, and Castform families.
我校最近开设了新的项目，人为干预哥达鸭、天秤偶和漂浮泡泡的家族基因序列。
While the exact methods of reproduction elude scientists, many suspect that selection forces remain at play.
目前参与的学者们，还在对测试用的繁育方法进行商讨，且其具体可行性仍受到质疑。
How this natural selection impacts man-made Pokemon could have remarkable insights on how other Pokemon change form over millennia.
我们无法确定自然选择是否会干扰到人造精灵的形成。

入学申请入口暂已关闭。
Acceptance letters will be sent out shortly.
录取通知将很快送达。
LuxTech Scholars will be contacted by a representative on their first week of classes.
来自光华市的学生将会在开学一周之内得到通知。
Our college isn't too grand, but we have three ace areas.
这所大学虽然不算顶尖，但却有3个王牌专业。
Paleontology, 3D printing, and electronics.
古生物考古，3D打印，以及电子科技。
When you combine them, you get the largest fossil studies and revival program in the world!
试想一下，如果将这三者结合起来，就会产生世界上最大的化石研究和复兴项目！

Grouz Station Captain, at your service.
你好，我是古治站站长。
Don't know why nobody stopped you at the cave mouth, but I guess that's all you can expect from grunts.
虽然不知道为什么没人拦住你，但我也并不因此感到奇怪。
Unless you got a proper ID card, we're not gonna let you through.
除非你有正式的身份卡，否则我们不会让你通过。
Too many would-be heroes have gotten themselves hurt fighting the Avatar in there...
我们见过太多自称为英雄的人，在里面被化身打成重伤了...
How'd you get your hands on a Chasm ID Card?
你怎么会有裂隙队的身份卡？
Don't tell me you stole that thing just to fight these Avatars.
别告诉我你是为了跟化身战斗，才去偷身份卡的。
Not sure if that's brave or just stupid.
真不知道该说你勇敢还是愚蠢。
Due to policy, I've got to let you through regardless of how I feel. Ridiculous, I know.
呵，出于政策，无论我怎么想，都得让你通过，真是荒谬。
Hah! If a single Ranger here had half of your grit I'd never have worry about anything.
哈哈！如果这里的护林员有你一半的勇气和实力，我就不需要再操这么多心了。
Since we let you through to fight the Avatar, how about you keep quiet about beating it?
出于我们让你通过的交换，请你暂时不要告诉外界，这里的化身已经被打败了，好吗？
They won't notice for a few days at least.
这样，应该能拖几天的时间。
Allow me and my team a well deserved vacation.
足够让士兵们休息休息了。
This assignment sucks...
这任务糟透了...
You get yourself a few badges as a hobby and all of a sudden they say you're getting drafted into this mess...
我本来只是处于爱好去挑战了几个道馆，然后就突然被征召进护林员了...
I could see all those flashy moves from back here...
从这里我都能看到那些花哨的招数...
Almost caught a stray shot!
还差点被流弹击中！
A right proper mess this is.
真是糟了个大糕！
None of us are getting paid enough for throwing our Pokemon at this Suicune over and over.
我们拿到的那一点工资，根本抵不上在这里跟水君玩命对战的工作量。
Can't even remember the last time I got more than five hours of sleep...
上1次一觉超过5小时已经是多久之前的事情了...
Need me a right proper bonus after this.
我需要一笔丰厚的奖金作为报酬！
Mans needs a full night of sleep as well.
我还需要睡1个好觉！
[Map125]
Whoa, careful kid. Ain't no adventure for you past here 'less you know what'cha doin'.
哇，注意安全，孩子！你知道这里是什么地方吗？
Can't let'cha through 'less you got the proper clearance.
除非你有许可，否则不能通过。
That gate ain't opening for any ol' Trainer that wanders in.
我们不会允许冒然闯进来的训练师通过那扇门的。
I ain't gon' stop you since you got yerself the proper clearance.
既然你有通行证，那我就可以让你过去了。
Ain't gon' like it, since you're just gonna get your behind handed to ya.
虽说我自身不愿这么做，毕竟你也只会被打败。
We'll I'll be darned! You took it down!
我惊了！你打赢了！
Yer good in my books kid. Ain't seen battlin' like that since my days as a grunt.
你干得很漂亮，孩子！自我从军以来，就没见过这样的战斗了！
The Svait Rescue Op owes ya one. I'm glad this crisis is a bit closer to bein' over.
霜皑救援队欠你1个人情，离结束这场危机更近一步了！
Alright y'all, time to get outta here!
好了各位，可以回家了！
You think you can best that monster? Best of luck.
你觉得你能打败那个怪物？那就祝你好运吧。
Takes 3 of us to just keep it from escaping...
每次阻止它跑出去，都需要我们3个人合力才行...
When you challenged that Avatar, I thought you just had as much pride as a Pyroar.
之前你要挑战这个化身时，我以为你只是个跟火炎狮一样自大的家伙。
But wow, you've got the skills to justify it.
但是你证明了的确有这份实力。
If everyone in Makya was as good as you, the Avatar Crisis would be an Avatar Inconvenience.
如果马凯亚能多一些像你这样优秀的人，化身带来的危机就是小问题了。
All I wanted was to attend the Makyan championships!
我只是来马凯亚参加锦标赛的！
How'd I even get involved with the Avatar of Entei of all things?
为什么会被卷入炎帝化身的防务工作当中啊？
I go to boarding school in Paldea and Team Star ropes me into their plans...
我一开始在帕底亚上学，然后莫名其妙加入了天星队...
I go to Galar and end up on a Team Yell cheer squad...
后来去了伽勒尔，又在旅店被呐喊队选中...
I got to Alola and I'm working for every famous evil dude under the sun?!
在之后去了阿罗拉，又无意之中帮某个邪恶老大干了不少脏活...
And now this?! I need to rethink how I travel...
为什么现在又是这种感觉？我是不是该改改自身的旅行习惯...
[Map126]
Stand ho! We have gathered here to appraiseth a bundle of treasures most wondrous!
站住！我们正在评估宝物的价值！
Longeth has't we taken to accrue this, and thee shall findeth it prudent to leaveth us to our work!
这是我们长久努力的回报，请你不要自讨没趣！
UNLESS!
难道...
Un. Less.
难道！
Thee dareth challenge us, for stake over such a wond'rous horde?!
你想要独吞这些宝藏？想要挑战我们？
Staking a claim on this? That'd be a mis-stake if you ask me!
真是个愚蠢的决定！
Quite indeed, mine own comedic companion!
没错，我的搭档！
Say, Great Sage Rennyo, doth thee knoweth this person who hast happened upon us?
伟大又神圣的雷尼奥，你认识这个突然出现的人吗？
I see.
我明白了。
Well, what shalt thee doth anon stranger?
好吧，陌生人，我想结果应该不会有什么变化。
Shall thee square us in a Pokemon battleth most enjoyable? Or shall thee cower before our combined might...
你要和我们进行一场最有趣的精灵战斗吗？还是在我们的联合面前退缩...
Fare thee well then, stranger. We shalt stayeth here and do our work, until a true challenger comes.
那好吧，陌生人，我们会继续待在这里，等待真正的挑战者。
Very well! Approach, stranger!
好的，那就来吧！
Bested at last!
终于被打败了！
Never before hast we set our eyes upon so great a champion as you.
我们从未见过你这样伟大的人！
Yeah, we really got whalloped for our wares!
我们为自身的贪婪付出了代价！
Truer word have ne'er been spoken!
就是这样！
We best be taking our leave.
我们该走了。
Exeunt!
谢幕！
A voice rings out from further into the cave.
山洞深处传来了吵闹声。
Lo! We hast finally found the treasure we hast been seeking!
我们终于找到这个宝藏了！
A heavy crate. Its front side lock has been broken off.
1个沉重的板条箱，锁头已经被保利拆解掉了。
There are items inside!
里面好像有些东西！
Nay
不
Yea
好
[Map127]
Stat changes affect Avatars, sure, but they have the ability to remove the negative changes somehow.
减小能力的技能对化身也有用，但效果不如一般精灵明显。
Perhaps stat-changing moves are more common wherever they come from.
也许这种变化类技能对他们来说，只不过是平常的开胃小菜？
Among the garbage, you see what remains of a MasterBall, crushed completely flat.
垃圾桶里，有1个被压成球片儿的大师球...
Are you stressed? I'm stressed.
你焦虑吗？我很焦虑。
My aura is dingy. My vibes are not even close to perect.
气场浑浊。能量场乱七八糟。
They gave these out last week, but it's doing nothing for me. So, you take it.
上周发的这个对我没用，给你吧。
Pay it forward!
把善意传下去！
Avatars are so scary.
化身太瘆人了。
Just the creepiest.
简直毛骨悚然。
I'd rather you not interrupt my lecture.
请不要打扰我讲课。
This information about avatars could save lives.
这些关于化身的知识点，或许就能挽救某人的生命。
I tried to face an Ursaring avatar up in the Split Peaks.
我曾在嵌口峰面对过圈圈熊化身。
I thought I'd be clever and use my Sinistea and my Duskull to completely negate its attacks.
我当时耍了点小聪明，试图用来悲茶和夜巡灵免疫攻击。
I learned the hard way that avatars can ignore immunities. With their Empowered moves, at least.
然后我就学到了化身无视免疫这个重要知识点，起码它们强化后的技能如此。
The damage was enough to send me packing. Later that day I heard that Victoire was able to take it down.
然后我就灰溜溜地逃走了，直到晚些时候，听说最后是薇克特尔打倒了它。
I bet that battle was a real carnival!
那一定是一场令人热血沸腾的激战！
If an avatar takes enough damage, it might retaliate with a special kind of move.
当1个化身受到足够多的伤害后，就会使用1种极其特殊的技能。
Not only is the move powerful, it changes the typing of the avatar itself!
这种技能拥有强大的威力，能够帮助它们恢复伤势，还可以改变它们自身的属性！
Make sure your team isn't caught off guard by a sudden matchup reversal.
挑战化身时一定要考虑好，自身的精灵是否有完全处理不了的属性变化。
Most Pokemon are only able to have one status problem at a time.
大多数精灵同时只会陷入一种异常状态。
Avatars, on the other hand, have no such defenses.
但是，化身并不在此列。
You can have an avatar that's burned and numbed simultaneously!
你可以让1个化身同时被麻痹和烧伤。
It's strange to consider what biological differences might have caused this discrepancy.
想想是什么生物差异导致了这种差异，真是奇怪。
A ranger buddy of mine told me about the Avatars of Entei, Raikou, and Suicune.
我有个护林员朋友跟我说，他曾面对过炎帝、雷皇和水君的化身。
He fought them, but won't tell me where at, the coward.
但是他没告诉我这些化身在哪儿，谁知道是不是在吹牛。
Though, maybe he's right to not get others involved.
不过话说回来，如果是真的，为了不牵扯进他人而保密也可以理解。
He's got three badges, and even then he failed to make a dent.
但我还是觉得他在吹牛，他也不过只拿到了3枚徽章而已。
During my field studies, I noticed that the avatars rarely attacked the same Pokemon over and over.
通过对数据的研究，我发现化身很少连续攻击同1只精灵。
They seemed to have a regular rhythm of switching who they were being aggressive against.
它们似乎在按照一种固定的节奏，切换它们攻击的对象。
Holding back to avoid being too lethal? Or something else?
难不成是良心发现不想下死手？谁知道呢！
The board is scribbled with field research notes about an Avatar of Vileplume.
黑板上详细地写着霸王花化身的详细资料。
Apparently a lot of stinky flowers bloomed nearby after it appeared. Gross!
在它出现之后，附近开出了很多散发着臭味的花！
[Map128]
Accessorize! Every Pokémon NEEDS an item!
装饰起来！每只精灵都需要1个物品！
If you can’t decide, give them Leftovers or a shiny new Gem and watch them strut their stuff.
如果你拿不定主意，给它们剩饭或闪亮的新宝石，然后看它们大显身手。
There are dozens and dozens of items to pick from, so I’m sure you can find something to match your Pokémon!
有几十种物品可供选择，我相信你能找到适合你精灵的东西！
Setting up with something like Dragon Dance can turn a Pokémon into an unstoppable juggernaut.
用龙舞之类的技能强化，可以把精灵变成不可阻挡的巨兽。
But be patient. Pick the right time and place.
但要耐心。选对时机和地点。
Wait for something you can set up on without being humbled, and make sure there’s no nasty surprises waiting in the wings.
等到你能安全强化的机会，并确保没有意外的威胁在等着你。
Remember to check the Info tab in battle.
记得在战斗中查看信息栏。
That’ll give you the nitty-gritty on your opponent’s stats – or yours.
它会告诉你对手（或你自身）的详细数据。
You can also check the MasterDex to see what kinds of moves your opponent learns.
你也可以查看MasterDex，了解对手可能学会的技能。
Otherwise you might find out something learns Ice Shard the hard way.
否则，你可能会在吃亏后才发现对手会冰砾。
And, hey, you can use it after the fight to find potential team members. Just filter and search.
而且，嘿，你可以在战斗后用MasterDex寻找潜在的队伍成员。只需筛选和搜索。
Hello again, champion.
又见面了，冠军。
Don't pay me any mind.
别管我。
I'm just here to discuss some possible changes to the monument with Jovan.
我只是来和约凡讨论纪念碑的一些可能的改动。
You've met, I believe?
你们见过，对吧？
I'll take your Pokémon for a few seconds.
请允许我暂时拿走您的精灵。
First, you should restore your Pokémon to full health.
现在你的精灵已经恢复活力了。
We hope you excel!
祝您一路顺风！
Offensive Pokémon need offensive moves.
攻击型精灵需要伤害类技能。
Most of the time you’ve got more moves than types.
大多数时候，你的技能比属性多。
That means you’re going to want some attacking moves that complement the moves that match your types.
这意味着你需要一些伤害类技能来补充与属性匹配的技能。
Think long and hard about those.
仔细考虑这些。
A Normal-type might want a Dark or Ground move.
一半属性精灵可能会想要恶属性或地面属性技能。
If your team’s weak to Ice, maybe here’s where you slip in a Mach Punch or a Flamethrower.
如果你的队伍弱冰，也许可以在这里加入音速拳或喷射火焰。
Think about it.
好好想想。
Heyo, \PN. Want some guaranteed one-hundred- percent success rate advice?
嘿，\PN。想要一些百分百成功的建议吗？
Never be afraid to bring, like, five Pokémon that all do the same thing.
别害怕带上5只功能相同的精灵。
They can’t counter all of them.
他们不可能全部防住。
No, but seriously, doubling or tripling or quadrupling down can overwhelm your opponent’s answers.
不，说真的，2倍、3倍甚至4倍的投入可以压倒对手的应对手段。
How many Water resists can they really have?
他们真的能有那么多抗水的精灵吗？
And, hey, if you’ve got a spare team slot, bring something hyper-focused on countering what counters you.
而且，如果你有空余的队伍位置，带一些专门针对你弱点的精灵。
Aww. Well, at least read what I’ve written. It’s up on one of the computers.
啊，好吧，至少读读我写的东西。它在一台电脑上。
\PN! Nice to see you.
\PN！能见到你真好。
I mean, you're the champion, now, so I suppose its only natural that you'd try take on the Battle Monument.
我是说，你现在是冠军了，所以我理所当然的希望你能来参加对战纪念碑的挑战。
I did some consulting work on the trainer AI, so I'm very aware that its quite a challenge.
我之前做过训练师AI的咨询工作，所以我知道这有多难。
Good luck!
祝你好运！
Champion. Good seeing you.
冠军，很高兴见到你。
Do you need some advice?
你需要一些建议吗？
Take a second draft. Running your team into the Monument without hours of research can feel like feeding them into a meat grinder.
再考虑一下。不经过充分研究就把队伍带进纪念碑，感觉就像把它们送进绞肉机。
But don’t discount the value of practice and iteration.
但不要忽视练习和调整的价值。
Take note of what you couldn’t answer.
记下你无法应对的情况。
Even swapping out a few moves or items can make a night-and-day difference.
即使只是更换几个技能或物品，也能带来天壤之别。
Even the most hopeless of teams can be honed into something usable with enough work.
即使是最无望的队伍，经过足够的努力也能变得可用。
Good to hear! I’ll refrain from wishing you good luck, then.
很高兴听你这么说！那我就不祝你好运了。
If said luck does begin to turn, though, I encourage you to read my guide.
但如果运气真的开始变差，我建议你读读我的指南。
It’s up on one of the computers.
它在一台电脑上。
Sure?
确定吗？
No thanks.
不了，谢谢。
Yeah.
是的。
Not really.
不太需要。
[Map129]
I am the most powerful ninja in Makya! I traveled all the way from Sweetrock Harbor to prove it!
我一路从蜜岩港来到这里，就是为了证明：我是马凯亚最强的忍者！
No, my candies!
不，我的糖！
The Shinobi code dictates that I let you pass. But beware, for my revenge will be swift...
根据忍者守则，我会让你过去，但是，我的报复很快就会...
A dark stone in the shape of a Nincada.
一块铁面忍者形状的深色石头。
It's slightly warm to the touch.
摸上去还有点温度。

Oh, I'd introduce you to her, but she's enjoying herself at Bluepoint Beach at the moment.
她现在去蓝莹海滩享受阳光了，回头我可以向你介绍她。
Lambert's House
兰伯特家
Hey, kiddo. What’s goin’ on? I heard you’re following me.
哟，小鬼，咋回事？听说我后面有个跟屁虫啊！
Well, go right ahead. Not gonna get a Beedrill in my bonnet over some kid toddling after me.
当然，我肯定不在意，你爱咋咋地。
By the time you find me, I’ll be Champion, and mom will have her mind made up.
不过等你追上我的时候，我肯定已经是冠军了，别到时候在妈妈面前哭鼻子哦！
Yeah, sure, make it sound like a real competition.
好，好，这才有竞争的样子。
What? Persian got your tongue? Whatever -- I didn’t call to hear you talk.
咋了？无话可说了？随便吧，反正我也不是为了听你说什么废话才打电话的，
Tsk, tsk. Feisty little runt.
哦，炸毛了？
You’re at the gym in that villa, right? Real gaudy place. I remember the gym -- want some advice?
你应该在那个俗气的破岛上对吧？该挑战那个道馆对吧？需要我给你一些建议吗？
Too bad. If you can’t beat that gym, you don’t deserve to even be in this competition. Bye!
菜就多练，连那个道馆都打不过，还妄图能超过我？再见！
You’ve always needed my help. Fine -- prove me wrong. We’ll talk again.
哼，早晚你会发现，没有了我的帮助你什么都做不到，争取一会儿不要哭着求我哟！
I've summered here for 20 years.
我已经在这儿度过了20个夏天。
I must say it really went to the dogs once Team Chasm started moving in.
从裂隙队接管这里开始，真是一年不如一年。
I especially don't like the gym leader they stationed here.
尤其是他们派来的那个道馆馆主！
Before all this, he was a bartender at some establishment for roustabouts.
要知道他之前可是个流浪汉酒吧的调酒师！
"Casaba Villa, Makya's #1 Vacation Spot"
"欢迎来到在马凯亚地区遥遥领先的--甜瓜度假村"
I volunteer at the PokeCenter here sometimes.
我有时会在这里的精灵中心当志愿者。
So many trainers come in with Numbed Pokemon after battling Lambert.
有很多训练师都会在跟兰伯特对战后，带着被麻痹的精灵前来求助。
Apparently a lot of new trainers struggle with that status, as it halves the Pokemon's speed and reduces the damage they do.
很多新手训练师都对这种异常状态非常苦恼，因为它不仅会让精灵的速度减半，还会减小所造成的伤害。
Greetings!
您好！
If appearances are to be believed, you seem to be a fine trainer.
如果我没看走眼，你一定是一位不错的训练师。
I'll be challenging the gym here soon, but need a bit more practice with this team in particular.
我正在为挑战这里的道馆做准备，但我的精灵还需要一些实战训练。
After all, my goal is to defeat the leader without any of my Pokemon fainting.
毕竟，我的目标是取得完胜，也就是在没有任何精灵昏倒的前提下打倒道馆馆主！
Therefore, I'd like to battle you, if you have the time.
所以，如果你有时间的话，我希望能跟你一起训练！
Call me <imp>Vanya</imp>.
你可以叫我<imp>凡雅</imp>，
Know that I am unique among trainers.
1个独一无二非常优秀的训练师！
In my quest for perfect victories, I have suffered perfect defeats as well.
虽然在追求完胜的过程中，我也曾遭受过完败，
Near everyone runs off after a bad loss, but not I.
但我不会像一般人那样落荒而逃！
You can <imp>perfect</imp> my team all you want, and I'll <imp>stay right here</imp>.
就算你真能赐予我<imp>完败</imp>，我也会做好<imp>下1次对决的准备</imp>。
If you would indeed like to battle me, and the team I've assembled to take down Lambert, just ask.
只要你有空了，可以随时来找我！
The berry plant is growing.
树果还在生长中。
Skipping Tamarind cutscene.
跳过塔玛琳的开篇剧情。
Morning, \PN, I'm <imp>Professor Tamarind</imp>.
早上好\PN，我是<imp>塔玛琳博士</imp>。
I'd say "welcome to Makya!", but that's not really why you're here.
毕竟你不是来这里旅游的，我就不说什么“欢迎来到马凯亚”了。
C'mon. Let's get you set up.
时间宝贵，跟我来吧。
Looks like we’re both moving on. Don’t worry, I’m not coming with you.
是时候出发了，放心，我不会跟着你的。
But, uh, there’s something I kinda forgot to fill you in on.
不过还有件事忘了告诉你。
Do you know about <imp>Team Chasm</imp>?
你知道<imp>裂隙队</imp>吗？
So, Team Chasm used to run this place. All of it -- the whole region.
裂隙队是这里曾经的管理者，我说的不只是这座岛，而是整个马凯亚地区。
They turned Makya from wilderness to a real region over the past twenty years.
他们用了二十年的时间，将马凯亚从一片荒野，发展成如今的模样。
Then, well, you know how it goes.
然后...嗯...就在八年前...
Some kid trainer decides to go on a rampage and takes the whole organization down.
一些年轻的训练师联合起来，将整个组织给搞垮了，
That was eight years ago.
这事闹得蛮大的。
But, uh, those people didn’t just disappear. Half the people you meet are gonna be ex-members.
我说这些是想告诉你，就算组织已经解散了，曾经的成员也不会就此消失。
Even more than that in the regional administration. They’re chill, but just… it’s better to know.
你在这里遇到的人，起码有一半都曾是裂隙队的一员，他们依然掌握着资源与权力...言尽于此。
Oh, so you did your research? Great. Spares me the effort.
哦？看来你做过功课了？也好，省得我浪费口舌。
Anyways.
总之，
I know you only care about being Champion and impressing Mommy.
我知道你只在意你妈妈的看法，以及如何成为这里的冠军，
But between the avatars and, uh, other issues, I’ve got problems that need taking care of.
但是很多问题是你绕不开的，比如“化身”什么的...
You’re talented and I can make it worth your while.
反正总会遇上，不妨顺便帮我解决一些麻烦，
Well, keep it in mind.
当然，这不是要求，是交易。
See ya, kid.
再见了，小孩儿。
Hey!
嘿
I'm bored and want to have fun. Let's play hide and seek!
太无聊了，来跟我捉迷藏吧！
I took some TMs from my Pa when he wasn't looking.
我趁爸爸不注意拿了一些技能机，
If you can find me, I'll give the TMs to you.
只要你能找到我，它们就是你的了。
I'll be somewhere on the route to the foreclosed tunnel. Smell ya later!
我会藏在城镇北边的某个地方，快来找我吧！
Casaba Villa Gym
甜瓜道馆
Leader: Lambert
馆主：兰伯特
Fighting dirty for over a decade.
数十年如一日，以肮脏形态出击。
Hey, \PN. I heard you beat Lambert.
嘿，\PN，你已经打赢兰伯特了？
Guessing you’re gonna head for the <imp>mainland</imp> now?
是前往<imp>大陆</imp>的时候了对吧？
Well, before you go, meet me at the dock, 'kay?
走之前先来码头见一面怎么样？
Got something to say. Thanks.
我有事跟你说。
She hung up...
挂断了...
Be careful outside the Villa, you don't want to end up as another incident in the newspapers.
在镇子外要小心一些，你也不想成为报纸头条上的受害者吧？
No, I'm not talking about wild Pokemon.
并不是说那些野生精灵有多危险，
Haven't you heard about the... "avatars" I think they were calling them?
难道你没听说过...他们好像管它们叫“化身”来着？
It's seemed like all anyone has wanted to talk about for 3 months!
最近3个月大家都在谈论它们！
I for one can't wait for the whole thing to blow over, so I can read again about things of real interest.
希望这热度赶紧消退吧，我更想在报纸上看些有用的东西。
Like the stock market.
比如说股市预测什么的。
Closed while Lambert participates in the Makya Championship Tournament.
马凯亚锦标赛期间暂时闭馆。
You keen to take me up on my offer?

我会在这里等你的。
Nice. Let's get into it.
很好，那就开始吧！
Well fought!
打得不错！
As promised, despite your overwhelming victory, I remain enthusiastic to try again.
不过就算你取得了完胜，我依然想再试1次。
Well, still some kinks to work out, it seems.
很棒，不过还有进步空间。
Heal up, and return to me at your leisure.
帮你的精灵恢复后再来吧。
As a fellow competitor, I have nothing to say but to congratulate you on your victory over Lambert.
作为竞争对手，我只能祝贺你战胜兰伯特。
I'll take this as the cue to go make my attempt as well. Wish me luck!
我也会以此为契机，继续加油的！
That was a fun game of hide and seek!
真好玩，真好玩！
I've learned that if I offer stolen goods to people, they'll let me do whatever I want!
我明白了，只要把偷来的东西作为奖励，就能让别人听我的！
Lambert has some interesting choices of Pokemon.
兰伯特有一些很有趣的精灵。
His prized Riolu was a gift from Victoire, another gym leader. Sangfroid, he calls her.
比如说另一位道馆馆主维克托送给他的那只利欧路，它的名字是“静静”。
A beautiful name, in my opinion!
真是个可爱的名字啊！
I believe Lambert also has a Croagunk. Or.... two of them?
除此之外，兰伯特还有一只...或者说两只不良蛙？
I'm not sure, but I swear I saw a sparring match, where the two seemed identical...
谁知道呢，反正我是看到过他拿出两只不良蛙的比赛...
As a fisher, you learn to pick up on small inconsistencies around you.
作为一名合格的钓鱼佬，必须要着重锻炼自身的观察力。
Take for example that bush behind me. I bet something's going on with it.
就比如说后面那个草丛，我一眼就看出它不对劲！
Would you look at that! Found yourself something nice.
看吧！你找到东西了！
Keep an eye out for those sort of things. Don't be afraid to poke around a bit.
所以要学会眼观六路耳听八方，不要嫌累，嫌麻烦。
You never know what you might find...
谁知道下1次会找到些什么...
Oh, you just got a MasterDex? They're pretty neat.
哦，你拿到大师图鉴了？
Of all its features, the DexNav is my favorite.
我最喜欢的是“图鉴导引”系统！
It's a really fun way to see what Pokemon you still have to catch in a new area.
我们可以利用这个系统，看到当前区域还没有抓到的精灵。
Once you've caught one, you can also use it to find more of that same species!
而且还能帮助我们捕捉更多已经抓过的精灵！
Isn't technology amazing?
这就是科技的力量！
You haven't completed what you need to on the island yet!
先处理完这座岛上的事情再出发吧！
Would you like to leave Casaba Villa and go to the Mainland?
要离开甜瓜岛前往大陆吗？
Oh, so it is you!
哦，你来了！
Forgive my doppelganger – a Ditto that stalks me incessantly, claiming to be the real deal.
还请你原谅另1个我 -- 那只是一只有些调皮的，试图冒充我的百变怪而已。
I had a dream that I would find someone here, and here you are!
我曾多次梦到在这里与某人的相会，而现在，你出现了！
May I read your palm?
我可以看看你的手相吗？
Oh? Afraid I may hex you?
嗯？你怕我诅咒你？
Rest assured, gramarye isn’t my forte.
放心，我是占卜师，不是巫师。
Very well.
好吧...
At least take this. It’s designed to ward off evil.
这个给你了，它有一定的驱邪功能。
Many thanks.
哼哼。
Now, let me see... yes, of course.
让我看看...没错，千真万确！
You are the shuttle of fate’s weave. Undoubtedly who I have awaited.
你就是命运之梭的执掌者，是那个我一直在等待的人。
Your future is fraught with danger, of course, so I made this to ward off evil influences. Please, take it.
你的前路充满了艰难险阻，所以我为你准备了这个，它或许能帮你渡过难关。
Well, I think my stalker and I shall be off now.
现在我要跟她离开了，
She wishes to visit some <imp>ice cave</imp> or another to prove a point.
她貌似想去<imp>冰之洞窟</imp>看看，
I dare not leave her alone, claiming to be me, so off I go!
我不可能放任另1个自身在外游荡，所以我必须跟上去！
Fare you well, traveler!
最后祝你好运，旅行者！
Lambert, the gym leader, came running through here earlier.
兰伯特馆主刚刚去西边了，
He put a rock behind him to block it off, for some reason.
而且还故意用石头堵住了路...谁知道他到底怎么想的。
You need to get through?
你要去海滩那边？
Well...there's an abandoned tunnel up to the north.
嗯...北边有1个废弃的隧道，
You can probably find something to blow this rock up if you go there.
那里或许能找到一些可以炸开这块石头的东西。
Oh hey, you cleared out that rock!
哦，你把石头处理掉了！
Who knew explosives could be so useful?
这炸药竟然这么猛？
We'll see.
走着瞧
...
...
Oh, shut up.
闭嘴！
Sure.
需要
I don't need your help.
谁需要你帮忙？
No
等下
Yes
走
Maybe later.
稍等一会儿
Sure, let's go.
来吧
No way.

[Map137]
I'm a safety minded person.
我是1个很注重安全的人。
For that reason, I wear a Hi-Vis Jacket with me wherever I go.
因此，我无论走到哪里都会带着一件显眼的夹克。
Everything's changed now that Avatars are around.
但现在有了化身这个威胁...
I'm worried they'll be drawn to me by the reflections.
我很担心他们会被这件夹克的反射吸引过来。
If you're going out and fighting those things, maybe that's somehow an upside for you...?
如果你想主动跟那些东西战斗，这或许会是一种帮助？
I'll need to check Eleig.com for any new safety products that will work on Avatars.
我得去网店上看看，有没有什么针对化身的安全装置。
[Map138]
The berry plant is growing.
树果还在生长中。
I caught this Pichu in the really tall grass!
我在那片高草丛中抓到了这只皮超！
Oh, didn't you know?
嗯？你还不知道？
The Pokémon that live there don't live in the other grass!
那边生活着跟普通草丛里完全不同的精灵！
Even my new Pokémon couldn't cut it...
即便有了新精灵还是赢不了...
Hmm, we'll see how they do on another try.
嗯，我们回头再试1次吧。
I wonder if there's good things to catch in the Cave up to the North...
不知道北边的洞窟里会不会有更好的精灵可以捉...
Wow, uh… reaching for your Poke Balls already, huh?
哇，呃...你已经要拿精灵球了吗？
I’m not here to battle you.
我不是来和你战斗的。
I don't even have a <imp>Pokemon next to me</imp>!
我甚至没有<imp>精灵在身旁</imp>！
...
...
To clarify… It’s standard for Trainers in Makya to have their follower Pokemon at their side when they are seeking a battle.
说清楚...在马凯亚，训练师在寻找战斗时，通常会让他们的跟随精灵在身边。
Frankly, I would have assumed you knew that already…
坦白说，我以为你已经知道了...
Anyways, now for the real reason I'm here.
至于我为什么会在这里...
Name's Jovan. I'm an inventor working for Sweetrock Candy Company.
我叫约凡。我是蜜岩糖果公司的发明家。
You’re \PN, right? I’ve been instructed to grant you one of our prototypes.
你是\PN，对吧？我被指示给你1个我们的原型。
Here. Take this.
给你。拿着这个。
This machine will store the excess energy generated from battling.
这台机器会储存战斗中产生的多余能量。
That can happen when you over-train your Pokemon.
当你过度训练你的精灵时，就会出现这种情况。
Once the Dispenser has gathered enough, you can activate it to make EXP Candy!
一旦分配器收集了足够的能量，你就可以激活它来制作经验值糖果！
That’s the idea, anyways. Let me know if you encounter any bugs.
这就是想法。如果你遇到任何漏洞，请告诉我。
I’ve tested it thoroughly, but putting products into the wild can be such a crapshoot…
我已经彻底测试过了，但把产品放到野外就像一场赌博...
Anyways, I have some research to do at the abandoned shop on Bluepoint Beach.
不管怎样，我需要在蓝莹海滩的废弃商店做些研究。
If you meet me there, I might have another cool invention to give you.
如果你去那里找我，我可能还会给你另1个很酷的发明。
Now if you’ll excuse me, I have to find out where my transportation has wandered off to.
如果你不介意的话，我得去弄清楚我的交通工具跑到哪儿去了。
Michi? Are you over here?
米奇？你在那边吗？
…of course you are.
...当然在。
I dropped my items! Where did they go?
我东西呢？掉哪儿了？
I can't believe I lost so badly!
竟然输得这么惨...
Guess I'll have to try again later.
回头再来一场！
Come back tomorrow, I might have more energy then...
等明天吧，我得先休息一下...
A well-fed Tropius. It’s carrying a large saddle with many attached bags.
一只养得很好的热带龙。它背着1个有许多附带袋子的大鞍。
You hear beeping and whirring sounds from inside them.

Welcome to the Starters Store! We stock a selection of Starter Pokemon from every region!
欢迎来到初始商店，你可以在这里获得来自各个地区的新手精灵。
If you've found a Token you can exchange one with one of our employees for a matching starter.
如果你拥有代币，便可以在这里交换一只与之相匹配的初始精灵。
For example, you could exchange a Grass Token for a Bulbasaur, a Snivy or a Grookey.
比方说，你可以用一枚茂盛代币，兑换一只妙蛙种子或敲音猴。
I hope you find a Pokemon that makes you happy!
希望你能得到自身满意的新伙伴！

你去埃利格河畔散步了吗？
It's quite the adventure, you can travel from its origin all the way to the ocean!
这是一条非常刺激的路，可以从源头一直走到海边！
There are quite a few stops along the way, so take a second to smell the roses.
沿途还有很多不错的景点，值得多花些时间。
Or the pansies, if you're on the Stretch.
比如说中游地区的紫罗兰。
Shiny Pokemon!
闪光精灵！
My life has been spent in pursuit of these Pokemon, the most unique of all!
它们是我这一生的追求，是最为特别的存在！
Years ago I caught wind of a unique substance called Gleam Powder, that can only be found here in Makya.
几年前，我听说马凯亚这里有一种叫说闪亮粉末的东西。
Shiny Pokemon are hyper rare, but a little bit of Gleam Powder will attract them to you like magic.
这种闪亮粉末能像魔法一样，吸引到那些闪光的精灵。
My artist's instincts drew me to another use: Turning boring standard Pokemon into Shinies!
但作为一名艺术家，我想到了另一种用法，那就是把普通精灵变成闪光！
If you can find some of that mystical Gleam Powder, it'd be my pleasure to paint one of your Pokemon into a glamorous shiny.
如果你能找到一些闪亮粉末，我很乐意将你的精灵，变成更为迷人的闪光形态。
I will have to charge, though. $30,000.
不过，是收费的，30,000金钱1次。
So, do you have any Gleam Powder? ...and the $30k?
你有闪亮粉末吗？并且有30,000金钱吗？
Oh, how boring it is to live a life without shinies.
唉，没有闪光的生活多么无聊啊。
No
没有
Yes
有
[Map145]
Whew...
呼......
Good work. I thought I'd be working for hours to fix a mess caused by that Deerling.
干得好，我本来以为得花几个小时处理这个问题的。
The Pokemon's yours, so long as you never tell my boss...
这只精灵是你的了，只要你不告诉我老板...
SHHHHHHHHHH!
嘘......
Quiet, stand still.
安静，别动。
I left the door open while I was on break.
我休息时没有关门。
This Deerling wandered in. Help me here, would you?
然后这只四季鹿就跑进来了，你能帮帮我吗？
Go up and catch it while it's not looking at us.
麻烦趁它不注意时抓住它。
Just sneak up to it, it seems like it's tired.
就悄悄地走过去，它好像有些累了。
You walk over to the Deerling, and the maid hands you a Pokeball...
你悄悄走到四季鹿身旁，接过了女仆递过来的精灵球...
You move into position...
准备就绪...
And tackle the Deerling before it can react!
在四季鹿反应过来之前，解决掉它！
You toss the Pokeball to catch the Deerling!
你当了一手一球超人！

Wow! A video of a Nibelong!

Seeking truth, as ever.
我还在寻找真相。
I cannot tolerate introspection, so extrospection will have to suffice.
我不擅长闷头去想，所以打算通过外界来引导。
The real one! The one that snaps at you if you say something so uncouth.
真的那个！如果你说了不礼貌的话，会咬你的那个！
The fake Imogene tries to ingratiate herself through saccharine kindness. Such as that amulet.
假的伊莫珍会试着通过过分的友好来讨好你，比如那个护身符。
Ah! Assist me – tolerate me – a while longer, would you?
啊！请帮帮我...再容忍我...一会儿，好吗？
You’re already in my grasp, and I am not afraid to bribe you to keep you there. I come bearing gifts, you see.
我已经知道怎么跟你相处了，你看，我带了礼物，靠这个应该可以吧？
But, to reach something resembling a point, I am here to reach a revelation.
不过，为了达到某种效果，我还在等待1个启示。
Look at this city: a sprawling blight. How many habitats, nests, spawning grounds were all stamped out for this?
看看这座城市：1个蔓延的瘟疫。为了建造它，有多少巢穴、栖息地都被破坏了？
A concrete atrocity, paving over the world.
这种铺设在世界上的混凝土暴行...
…Perhaps. Pokémon have made their warrens here, too.
...或许，这里的地下，也有精灵创建了自身的家园。
The old died out that the new might live. Not so much erasure, then, but rather…
旧的消失了，新的得以诞生，所以这不是抹除，而是...
Indeed they do. Life has not been extinguished like a match ground underfoot. It has simply undergone a…
的确，生命并没有像是被踩灭的火柴一样消失，而是经历了一种...
I lived a great many years in a single-story nest of wood. It was comfortable enough.
我曾经在一座单层的木制巢穴中生活了很多年，那里还算舒适。
And yet everywhere I wander I find more wilderness gone. A creeping…
然而，无论我走到哪里，都会发现越来越多的生机消失。逐渐被...
Agree with what?
同意什么？
With me? I am not so sure I agree with myself. After all, life thrives here, albeit in different forms.
同意我的想法吗？我自身都不知道自身是不是对的。毕竟这里也有生命在茁壮成长，尽管其形式并不相同。
Evolution? Devolution? Certainly a…
是进化，退化？还是说...
Transformation.
转化。
And so I find myself here. The wild and untamed has shapeshifted into humanity.
所以我发现自身出现在这里，曾经的原野也变成了人类的巢穴。
That is what a city is, yes? The human biome?
或者说城市，对吗？这是人类的生物群系？
So what can I learn from all this? Is this what I am? An expression of humanity? Or is this a fake, too? With the untamed merely putting on a charade?
那么我能从中学到什么呢？这是我，还是人类的体现？还是说只是1个假象？只是原野在装模作样？
Do you believe I’m the real one?
你相信我是真的吗？
Thank you. I merely wish to prove it to her.
谢谢，我只是想向她证明这一点。
It would be a mercy, really – she is living a lie, quite literally. She deserves to be true to herself.
这其实也算一种仁慈...她一直活在1个谎言中，她应该对自身更真实些。
Hmph.
哼。
I suppose I can’t blame you. My assumption that my counterpart is a Ditto is founded purely on it being the only explanation.
我想我也没办法怪你，毕竟我的存在对应着百变怪，你最开始得到的就是这个解释。
Hardly convincing, but I know I am real, and therefore she cannot be.
我知道很难让人相信，但我自身清楚自身是真实的，那么她就不可能是真实的。
…Ah.
...啊。
I suggest you simply make up your mind, one way or another. In indecision lies madness.
我建议你还是做出1个要么是，要么否的判断，犹豫不决只会让你走向疯狂。
In truth… sometimes I doubt myself.
其实...有时我也会怀疑自身。
I remember being a child. I remember living years under my old home.
我记得小时候的生活，记得在老家度过的岁月。
And yet, I cannot remember when she began following me. No more than I can remember being born.
但是，我却记不起她是何时开始跟着我的，也不记得自身是何时出生的了。
Does that make me…
这让我...
But nevermind that. I have a gift.
不过，这不重要。我有一份给你的礼物。
Something destroyed by its transformation. And yet, it has found strength in that.
它经历了毁灭和转变，但在其中找到了力量。
I am unsure of what that may imply about my situation, and so I pass it on to you.
我不确定这是否与我的处境相关，所以我决定把它交给你。
Imogene passes you a Poké Ball. Inside is a Galarian Corsola. It seems happy to see you… as much as it can seem happy.
伊莫珍将1个精灵球递给你，里面是一只伽勒尔太阳珊瑚。它似乎很高兴见到你...尽管表情不太明显。
Another arrow in your quiver. Or perhaps another companion for the long road ahead.
这是你旅途中的又一件武器，或者是又一位伙伴。
In either case, may it prosper under your care.
无论哪种情况，都希望它在你的照顾下茁壮成长。
So long, traveler. I will head south, to home. You’re a welcome guest if ever you should arrive.
旅途愉快，我要往南走，回家去了。如果有机会，欢迎你来做客。
Oh? Very well.
哦？好吧。
If you find it unsuitable or untenable to take it, I will find someone else. Perhaps the local Pokécenter will take it in the interim.
如果你觉得不适合或者无法照顾它，我会找其他人来接手。也许当地的精灵中心可以。
In any case, I take my leave.
无论如何，我先告辞了。
I will head south, to home. You’re a welcome guest if ever you should arrive. So long, traveler.
旅途愉快，我要往北走，回家去了。如果有机会，欢迎你来做客。

But it turns out they’ve got, like, industrial amounts of stones in town. So I liberated a few extras.
他们把几乎所有进化石...大概...都集中到这座城市里了，所以我解放了其中一部分。

I am sad I cannot spend my twilight years here. That is life, I suppose.
我很遗憾不能在这里安享晚年，或许，这就是生活吧。
It is time for a picnic.
是时候去野餐了。
You would not know our devotion, outsider.
外人，你不会懂我们的奉献的。
It is over. There is nothing left to do but wait.
一切都结束了，除了等待别无他法。
Oh, hi! I was expecting ya from Vincent.
哦，我还以为是文森特呢。
Uhhhhhh... Welcome! To our uhhh... humble abode?
呃...欢迎！光临我们的...寒舍？
We used to get more guests a looooong time ago, but we don't get them much now. I guess a sinking island isn't the best place for investors...
很久之前这里的客人还比较多，但现在已经没有往日的辉煌了，对投资者来说这里并不是啥好地方...
Oh well! Can't save 'em all... just uhh... enjoy it while it lasts? Haha...
好吧，这样也挺好...只是，呃...现在好好享受吧，哈哈！
Anyways! We have a healing center! I'm qualified a nurse, actually! Just don't have the typical uniform.
起码，我们这里还有治疗中心！其实我也是个有执照的护士，只是没有制服罢了。
We certainly like to battle here on this island! Just like uhhh... literally every other person... So that's cool!
我们岛上的人也很喜欢对战，跟其它...地方的人一样，大概...毕竟这很酷！
Anyways I'll be in that building behind me if you need me! Ummm, enjoy your stay and uhhh... talk with some of the locals!
总之，如果你需要我的帮助，那就到后面的房子里找我，祝你在这里玩得开心...另外，多和当地人聊聊天吧！
Leave us to our ways, Trainer.
别管我们了，训练师。
You had to meddle. We have lost our traditions because of you!
就是你们在多管闲事，因为你们，我们失去了传统！
Ah, a visitor. It is rare to see one nowadays. I can hardly remember the last one's face.
啊，有一位访客！已经很久没人来这里了，我都快想不起上1个访客的样子了。
It's a shame. Memory is the only thing we have, and the only tool we can work with.
真遗憾...记忆是我们唯一拥有的东西，也是我们唯一可利用的工具。
Tell me Trainer, what is your greatest memory?
训练师，你最美好的回忆是什么？
A mighty accomplishment indeed. I wonder, will it be your favorite when you lose the title?
这的确是一项了不起的成就，我想知道，当你失去冠军头衔后，你最喜欢的还会是它吗？
You possess a full heart, Trainer. I wonder, will it be your favorite after you have seen them for the last time?
你有一颗饱满的心，训练师。我想知道，当你最后1次与他们相见后，你最珍视的记忆，还会是这一部分吗？
A feat of courage, and a show of strength! I wonder, will it be your favorite when your anger cools?
这是勇气与力量的展示！我想知道，当你的怒火平息，最怀念的还是这一部分吗？
It is wise to look forward. I wonder, will it be your favorite when you only have the future?
展望未来是明智之举，但我想知道，如果只有未来，那它还会是你的最爱吗？
This island, our home, will soon be nothing but a memory. What an awful fate.
这座小岛是我们的家园，但它很快就会成为回忆，这是多么可怕的命运。
There is nothing that can be done other than making one last memory.
除了留下最后的记忆外，我们别无他法。
A final hurrah before the shore closes in. A battle to shatter this island's very roots.
在海岸逼近之前最后的狂欢，一场足以破坏岛屿根基的战斗。
Are you ready, Trainer, to battle?
你准备好了吗，训练师？
There are memories to be made, Trainer. Do not leave me apathetic.
我们都有美好的回忆，训练师，不要让我对此感到遗憾。
A disappointment, to say the least.
最终，还是失望。
If there is one think I know though, it is that minds can change. Change mine.
我明白，思想是可以改变的，或许我应该改变自身的想法。
Very well, I shall be here, looking for another memory.
好的，我就在这里，等待着下一段回忆。
I suppose that's that then. A final memory.
我想就这样吧...最后的记忆。
It was not unpleasent, Trainer. It was the best we could do in such a short time.
这算不上愉快，训练师。但这么短的时间，也只能如此了。
If you would like, this is our farewell. Soon, we will fade into each other's memory. Some time after, we will fade even further than that.
如果你愿意，这将是我们的告别，很快，我们就会淡出彼此的记忆，再过一段时间或许会完全消失。
But perhaps, there is something more. I must gather myself inside my little cove. You are free to follow.
但是，或许还有更多东西...可以藏在我自身的小海湾里，你请便。
I cannot let this happen!
我不会让这一切发生！
There is nothing left for us to do...
我们已经无计可施了...
I ache Trainer! There is hole in one's self when they lose their home, it is a heart torn in two!
我好难过，训练师！当1个人失去家园时，他的内心就会被空洞撕成两半！
The past has always been outside of our reach. And yet, when you cannot see it, it feels even further.
过去总在我们的视野之外，越是看不到它，越能感觉到它的遥远。
And yet, I do not feel despair. I feel bittersweet. When I think of home, it is impossible to not feel a little bit of warmth inside.
但我并不会对此感到绝望，我只会同时感觉到痛苦与快乐。每次想到家园，内心都能感受到一丝温暖。
Have you felt that conflict before, Trainer? A feeling of warmth and joy that lives within sorrow?
你感受过这样的冲突吗，训练师？那种悲伤中掺杂着温暖和喜悦的感觉？
I know your pain, Trainer.
我能明白你的痛，训练师。
The world is never the same after someone leaves, but we are always glad that we got to live in that world.
当某个人离开后，世界也不再是之前的那个了，但我们总会庆幸自身曾经生活在那个世界当中。
We think of the time spent with them, doing nothing. We regret it. Yet, that time is where they became who they are to us.
想起和他们一起的无所事事的时光，会让我们感到遗憾，但也正因为他们，我们才会成为今天的自身。
One day, maybe, we can forgive ourselves.
也许有一天，我们可以原谅自身。
They never look at us the same afterwards.
在那之后，他们看我们的目光就不一样了
You realize you cannot imagine them without thinking about how their expression changed when they learned of your failure.
我们会意识到，自身无法想象他们在得知我们的失败之后，表情会发生怎样的变化。
Sometimes, it is a necessary mistake to make. There is no growth if we let ourselves simmer.
有时，这是必然的错误，如果任由自身沉沦，就不会有所成长。
Then you are blessed now and cursed to feel it.
所以，你很幸运，能感受到它的诅咒。
But that is life, young one. You must realize that, as we love to say, it is what it is.
但这就是生活，年轻人，你必须一点点去理解事情的全貌。
I am filled with sorrow. It is the price I pay for joy.
我虽然心中充满悲伤，但这是我为快乐付出的代价。
But I am not helpless. I choose to pay again and again. Each time it worth it.
不过我并非束手无策，我每次选择的付出都是值得的。
Now, Trainer, will you show me a little bit of the joy you feel in battle?
现在，训练师，你能向我展示下战斗中的快乐吗？
There is no joy in battle without the bitterness of frustration. Let us pay your dues to our wiles.
没有挫折的苦涩，就没有胜利的喜悦，让我们用诡计来偿还你的代价吧。
Ahah! Take that!
哈哈，接招吧！
A-hem, I mean, frustration is a natural part of growth. Grow, and approach me again, Trainer.
我觉得，挫折是成长的自然过程，成长过后再来找我吧，训练师。
Afriad? Or cautious? Ah, well, it doesn't matter.
是害怕，还是谨慎？好吧，无所谓了。
I will be here. We all smile eventually.
我会在这里，我们都会得到微笑。
Perhaps you have caught a glimpse of that feeling, Trainer.
或许你已经触及到这种感觉了，训练师。
It matters not, you will feel it soon enough. It will feel wonderful and awful and all of those great things.
没关系，很快你就能感受到，那些让你觉得美妙与可怕的事物，以及它们所蕴含的美好。
I will collect my feelings before I leave. I'll be inside.
我会收拾好心情再进去，等待离开的那一刻。
If you would like to follow, you are more than free.
如果你想跟上来，我也不会阻拦你。
A guest! What a pleasant surprise!
有客人！真是惊喜！
Have you come to challenge me? I have a bit of time to test my mettle.
你是来挑战我的吗？我也的确有些时间来检验一下自身的实力。
Ah, but before we get too far ahead of myself, I must sate my curiosity.
啊，不过在这之前，先满足一下我的好奇心吧。
You seem no stranger to struggle, but tell me, have you ever been broken by challenge?
看起来你应该很熟悉对战吧，那你曾经被打垮过吗？
Utterly shattered. Reduced. Something you viewed as damningly insurmountable?
就是被彻底打败...那种事，或者说你觉得无法克服的事情？
Hmm, bold. It is one thing to break yourself for another. It is another for them to mock your pieces.
嗯，很大胆。为他人牺牲是一回事，被别人嘲笑不值又是另一回事。
It can be a moment that defines your world, and you are not in control of it.
这或许是1个你可以决定自身生活在1个什么样的世界的时刻，但你并不能掌控它。
And you certainly you gained something in the end! Of course, you know as well as any that the real danger lies afterwards.
当然，你肯定会有所收获！而且你也应该清楚，真正的危险，还在那之后。
It is one thing to climb a mountain once. It is another to climb a hill each day.
爬山是一回事，但每天怕啥就是另一回事了。
If honesty were a virtue, you'd qualify as a saint.
如果诚实是一种美德，那你就可以被称为标杆了。
Not that it's a good thing.
当然这也不一定是好事。
Then there is something you must do, now! There is a wide open world out there, but you must be torn down for a new life to grow!
那现在，有件你必须要做的事情，那就是铲掉眼前的这个广阔世界，并让新的生命再次生长！
But I digress. The force of will takes man and mon far, but it cannot always overcome cold reality.
抱歉，我跑题了，意志，能使人走得更远，但它不是一定能战胜冷酷的现实。
This island will be gone. There are some that refute that.
这座小岛马上就不复存在，但有些人却对此反驳。
Sometimes, there is value in fighting the inevitable. Sometimes. I am never sure about it until it is over.
有时，与不可避免之祸斗争，会付出难以想象的代价。有时，在事情结束之前，谁也不知道是否还有转机。
There are those who try to preserve this place, as foolish as that might be.
有些人在试图保护这个地方，虽看看起来感觉很愚蠢。
I wonder how it will end up for them. It is a good trial, and a proper funeral.
虽然不知道他们的结局会如何，但这是1次合适的审判，也是一场体面的葬礼。
But that is them. I should focus on myself. I am ready for challenge. Are you ready for battle, Trainer?
但那是他们的事。现在我们该关注自身，我已经准备好接受挑战了，你准备好了吗，训练师？
Excellent!
很好！
Now is the time! Let us break and reform from our struggles!
现在正是时候！让我们从纠结中挣脱出来吧！
And you lay before me in pieces.
你在我面前支离破碎了。
There's only one direction to go from here. Regain youself, and try again. You can do better.
从这里开始，只有1个方向，重新找回自身，再试1次，你可以做得更好。
Very well, but do not leave me waiting. I abhor idleness.
很好，但别让我等太久，我讨厌无所事事。
I am looking for one last trail myself. Are you ready for battle, Trainer?
我在寻找最后的踪迹，准备好了吗，训练师？
Wonderful! It was about time for me to shatter!
太棒了，是时候让我崩溃了！
I revel in that sting you get when you know you've been outmatched! It is undeniable, how jealous I am!
我陶醉于那种不敌对手的刺痛感，不可否认，我甚至有些嫉妒你！
But such a feeling is fleeting, for better and for worse.
但这种感觉无论好坏，稍纵即逝。
It's time for me to get ready for the next hill. I'll be inside if you need me.
我该为下一座山做准备了，如果你需要，我就在里面。
These Guardians have been here since before all of us.
这些守护者在我们来此生活之前，就已经在这座岛上了。
If there is a way forward, they will bring us there.
如果有出路，它们会拯救我们。
You have snuffed out any hope that we had.
你掐灭了我们的希望。
I'm not sure that it was a good or bad deed.
我不知道这到底算什么。
We seek its power to heal our home.
我们寻求它治愈家园的力量。
You must have a plan!
你必须得有个计划！
Centuries of guidance cannot end like this!
几个世纪的传承不能就这样结束！
So many here wish to give up our homeland. To what! Simple time and happenstance?
这里很多人都希望我们放弃家园，为什么？只是因为时间和偶然？
I will depart, but I will be bitter. The spirit of our island will sink with it.
如果我离开，就会感到痛苦，我们的精神也会随着岛屿而沉没。
I am surrounded by fools! The sages are right! We must adapt or perish!
周围这些人都是傻子，\先知是对的，我们要适应它，不然终将会灭亡！
Leave me be, outsider.
别来管我，外乡人。
My Rampardos and I have a unique camaraderie. We suffer from hair loss.
我和我的战锤龙们有一种独特的友谊，我们都有脱发问题。
I need to get a sick crown like my Rampardos...
我需要1个战锤龙那样的头盖...
I must treat the little hair I have left kindly.
必须善待我所剩无几的头发。
Mmm. Maybe I should buy a hat.
嗯...或许我该买顶帽子。
Hon hon! This island has exceptional beauty! It is a shame I will be the last visitor to see it.
吼吼，这座岛真漂亮啊！很遗憾，我将是最后1个看到它的游客了。
Oh, are you also foreign to here? Well, that ruins the title of "last visitor".
哦？你也是外乡人啊？好吧，这下“最后的游客”就不是我了。
Ah, the locals here are so good at battling.
啊，这里的人真擅长对战。
I think I'll enjoy a fine Kalosian wine...
有点想念我们卡洛斯的美酒了...
Look towards the future, Trainer. You might miss how much of a mess the past becomes.
展望未来吧，训练师，即便再怎么怀念混乱的过去。
Come, my Pokemon. Let us take a final stroll.
来吧，我的精灵，让我们最后再散散步吧。
It's a shame how the past has been tainted.
真遗憾，过去的一切都被玷污了。
We are old minded here. But our ways are nothing in front of nature.
这里的人们思想守旧，但在大自然面前，什么也不是。
We like to forget that we are still a part of nature, no matter how high we build ourselves.
我们喜欢忘记那些，无论将房子修建得有多高，我们仍是大自然的一部分。

\PN.
\PN。
Thank you for listening to me and coming here.
谢谢你听我说，并来到这里。
\PN!
\PN！
Are you sure you aren’t Psychic-type?
你确定你不是超能属性吗？
I spent the last day mulling over whether to call you, and here you are, arriving of your own accord.
我花了整整一天考虑是否要给你打电话，而你却自身来了。
…I’m glad to see you, even if part of me isn’t…
...我很高兴见到你，尽管我内心的一部分并不是...
Let’s get right to business.
让我们直接进入正题。
You probably figured this out already, but I’m ex- Chasm.
您可能已经弄清楚了，但是我是前裂隙队的。
A few years ago I joined an expedition into the Circuit Cave organized by the Makyan Government.
几年前，我加入了马凯亚政府组织的电路洞窟探险队。
Our goal: to understand the circuitry and machinery housed in the lower layers.
我们的目标：了解下层的电路和机械装置。
As it turns out, being the only engineer in a throng of useless academics makes it hard to get anything done.
事实证明，作为1个工程师，周围却是一群无用的学者，很难做成任何事情。
Who cares about “cultural significance” or “hydrological processes" when we don’t even know what the thing does?!
当我们甚至都不知道这个东西是做什么的时候，谁会在乎“文化意义”或“水文过程”呢？！
…but that’s all in the past, now.
...但那都是过去的事了。
I brought you here because of a different group of ex-Chasm.
我把你带到这儿是因为另一群前裂隙队成员。
The Drillers.
钻工队。
What a lovely bunch they are.
他们真是个可爱的群体。
They’re basically a gang wearing ranger uniforms— and this corner of Makya is their “turf”.
他们基本上是一群穿着护林员制服的帮派——马凯亚的这个角落是他们的“地盘”。
Usually we’re keen to avoid the Regi Tombs, but recent events have… got some of us nervous.
通常我们都尽量避开巨人墓穴，但最近发生的事情...让我们中的一些人感到不安。
That’s what the Drillers are saying, anyways… that they’re here to protect the place.
钻工队是这么说的...他们说他们来这儿是为了保护这个地方。
Keep the prisons secure.
确保监狱的安全。
I think that’s a load of Tauros dung.
我觉得那都是肯泰罗的粪便。
And even if it’s not, I don’t trust them around the machines.
即使不是这样，我也不信任他们在机器旁边。
So, my request: Figure out what The Drillers are doing. And stop them, if my instincts about their mission prove correct.
所以，我的请求是：弄清楚钻工队在做什么。如果我的直觉关于他们的任务是正确的，就阻止他们。
Finish the job that I can’t.
完成我无法完成的工作。
I’ll stand watch out here.
我会在这里站岗。
Need a refresher? I know, it’s a lot of information.
需要复习一下吗？我知道，这有很多信息。
The Drillers have invaded the Oasis System.
钻工队入侵了绿洲系统。
They’re a bunch of brutes, and probably up to something.
他们是一群粗人，可能在谋划着什么。
Even if they’re not, I don’t want them anywhere near the place.
即使不是这样，我也不想让他们靠近那里。
I’ll never figure out why the ancients built this System if The Drillers find a way to “accidentally” destroy it first.
如果钻工队先找到“意外”破坏这个系统的方法，我就永远也弄不清楚古人为什么要建造这个系统。
In short: find The Drillers and—if neccessary—evict them.
简而言之：找到钻工队，并且——如果有必要——把他们赶出去。

You two got acquainted, then? Damn. Nary a scratch on this place.

Or any paths at all, honestly.

Oh? Then things really have changed since last time we met.

For both of you, now that I think about it.
你们2个都发生了很大的变化。
Now that’s just grand.
那真是太棒了！
What I wanted, honestly. I’ve basically been shipping you two – except, y’know, with violence instead of…
这就是我想达成的目的，我一直想让你们2个联系在一起，即便用一些暴力手段...
I should’ve left that thought in my head.
我应该把那种想法深埋在脑海里。
Anyways…

Over a year. Two since we’ve talked.

Indeed! I wanted to get you to meet her, but I know your type. I can bait a hook.
当然！我想让你和她见见面，所以就拿这个作为钓上你的鱼饵了。
Well, if you’re interested I can – actually, it’s probably better for you to hear it from her mouth. You’ll see her again.
好吧，如果你有兴趣，我可以让你...或许从她嘴里听到可能更好。你们肯定还会再见面的。
She wouldn’t let a potential challenger go.
她不会放过任何潜在的挑战者。
But!
但是现在，
Your gift.

Since avatars turned the bridge to flotsam – and, yes, I TOLD THEM to reinforce it!
尽管我告诉过他们要加固大桥，但化身还是把它变成了漂在河面上的碎块！
They didn’t, since they trust ex-Chasm about as far as they can throw them and – anyways!
那些家伙把我的话当成耳旁风，毕竟他们不愿意相信1个前裂隙队成员
For very stupid, avoidable reasons, the river’s basically uncrossable without Surf.

先让她进到里面去...现在我绕到后面去，你从前面进入，这样就能形成堵截之势，她就插翅难飞了。能明白我的计划吗？
Great. Like, yeah, of course.
太好了，大概...就这样行动！
You’re my friend, right?
我们是朋友，对吧？
Oh, yeah, I’m, like, yeah. I’m, like, totally ready.
当然，我，大概...已经准备好了，我完全准备好了。

别担心，我们会让一切朝着更好的方向发展。
At least a little bit.

Like, she’s gotta confess and tell us what she did, right? And then we’ll bring her to justice!
大概...她必须坦白告诉我们她之前都做过些什么，然后我们就会把她绳之以法
...OK, to be, like, totally honest with you: I’m worried you’re gonna betray me.
...好吧，说实话，大概...我最担心的是...你不是站在我这边的。
Because she, like, did you a favor and you’re working with her and all that.
毕竟她帮过你的忙，你们还在一起工作什么的。
But you won’t. I mean, like, she caused all of this! This entire place is mega-screwed because of what she did!

This is such a nice spot, I should bring a couch out here.
这地方真不错，我应该带一张沙发来。
Used to look a little more pretty before the Biberal cut down the trees, but I appreciate the company.

So, Tamarind and I, like, kissed and made up? Kinda?
我和塔玛琳走到一起了？大概...也许吧！
Um, not in that way. She’s like twenty-five years older than me.
呃，我不是那个意思。她比我大二十五岁。
I... \PN, I still really hate her. She is, like, the worst.
我...\PN，我还是很讨厌她。她就是...大概...最差劲的那个人。
She’s this snooty arrogant brat that literally destroys things that get in her way for no reason. But, like, I can’t just punch her and make it better.
她就是1个自大傲慢的娇娇女，没有任何理由地破坏她前进的路上的一切。但只靠打她一顿...大概...并不能让一切变好
...But I did punch her.
...可我确实打了她。
Not really! It was kind of a wimpy punch. Still, I had to do it.
我没有下很重的手！只用了一种较为温和的手段，我必须这样做。
For baby Candy, at least.
至少为了将来的小糖儿...
I know, I know! It was stupid.
我知道，我当然知道！这很蠢。
But, like, I’ve thought about it so many times, and now I finally got to do it.
我想这样做...大概...已经很久了，现在我终于将它变成了现实。
It didn’t make me happy, but I can scratch it off the list, y’know?
的确这并没有让我感到快乐，但我可以把这个目标从心中删去，你能明白吗？
Oh, not even. She deserves to be punched, like, at least twice.
不，一点也不。她至少应该...大概...被打2次。
What? That punching her doesn’t make it better?
你想说什么？打她不会让事情变得更好吗？
Or that I, like, decked her in the first place? Because the answer is yeah, I’m a learning Candy.
或者说我打她...大概...是错的吗？恐怕是这样的，我现在只能算是个小号的经验糖...
Really, I let her off easy. But, um, I didn’t really let her off.
实际上，我反而给她减轻了压力。但是，嗯，我并没有真正原谅她。
I kinda... got hired? Like, I do not trust that hag for a second, so I’m gonna stick to her like a Remoraid.
这好像...让一切...变成我的职业了？大概...那个老太婆我一秒钟都不愿相信她所以我会像铁炮鱼一样附在她身上。
She’s gonna fix all the messed-up stuff that she and her cronies caused.
她需要弥补一切她和她的党羽造成的混乱。
And she’s, like, totally overworked, so, um... yeah. I’m her aide now!
而且她正在全力做这些，大概...所以，嗯...是的，我现在是她的助手。
And bodyguard. And conscience.
同时兼任保镖，还要作为她的良心去监督。
I get to get justice, and she gets to not have her labs be on fire. Everyone wins.
我可以得到正义，她可以让实验室不再着火，双赢。
Heh… thanks. I’m, like, not sure of anything right now.
真的...谢谢。我现在...大概完全不能确定自身做的每个决定是不是对的。
Who knows! Maybe I’ll think better of it tomorrow and firebomb her lab anyways!
管他呢！也许我明天会想明白一切，然后照例烧毁她的实验室！
Hey! What’s that supposed to mean?
嘿！那是什么意思？
Do you think I’m just, like, this belligerent ditzy manic Spritzee dream girl?
你认为我只是1个冒着傻气，好斗又易怒的粉香香吗？
No, but, yeah, I get it. I don’t know that I’m, like, super cut out for this either.
不，可是...没错，我明白。我也不清楚自身...大概...是否适合这个工作。
Um. I think, like, you can get fired for that? So... no?
嗯，我觉得，大概...这样做可能会被解雇吧？所以...不行？
Maybe. I’ll think about it.
谁知道呢，我会考虑一下。
Well, now if I want to steal someone’s Pokémon back I can just have Tamarind order it, so, like, I guess not?
的确，如果我现在还想要偷走别人的精灵，只要让塔玛琳下个命令就行了，所以我觉得没必要了吧？
I’m still gonna steal things. Let’s all be, like, honest for a second: I’m not changing my ways.
但我可不敢打包票，让我们都诚实一点：我不会改变我的作风。
But I am gonna be busier with other stuff now! So, yeah. There’s that.
但是我现在有其他更重要事情！这会消耗掉我多余的精力，大概...就这样。
Oh, by the way, Tamarind was all like:
哦，顺便说一下，塔玛琳刚才说：
“If you want proof that I’m doing my damnedest to help this region” and then she blabbered about like a secret lab and horrible monsters.
“如果你想要确定我正在尽自身所能帮助这个地区什么的”，然后她突然跑题唠叨起来，说了一些关于秘密实验室以及可怕的怪物的事情。
Y’know. Like, containing an extradimensional evil and all that. Anyways, she gave me this key, but I don’t really, like, care?
像是1个超维度的邪恶生物之类的，随后她给了我这个钥匙，但我不是很在意这些。
Like, sure, whatever, she did hard work. She wants to prove she’s good, she can put her money where her mouth is and prove it by working with me.
大概...当然，她也付出了很多努力，她如果想要证明自身，完全可以付诸行动，和我一起工作来证明自身。
Anyways, um… you can have it? Maybe cool stuff? Maybe extradimensional evil?
我只是...你可以拿走它吗？里面可能是很酷的东西？又或者是超维度的邪恶？
Um, anyways, yeah. I, um, yeah.
嗯，不管怎么说...我...我，我想说。
Thanks.
谢谢。
Thanks, like, a lot. You’re a good friend.
真的非常感谢，你是个真正的益友。
But, um, I think that’s it.
差不多就这样了。
I have to go with Tamarind now and make sure she doesn’t, like, kick a child or something on the way back to Prizca.
我现在必须和塔玛琳一起离开了，确保她不会在回宏礼市的路上踢路边熊孩子的屁股，或者做其他不怎么合适的举动。
So, this is goodbye. And, well, you know what that means.
所以，这就是告别了...你知道这意味着什么。
*sniff* Yeah... aww, \PN, we can’t be justice friends anymore.
*哭泣* 是啊...嗯...，\PN，我们不能再做正义之友了。
We’ll just be regular friends.
我们只能做普通的朋友了。
I’m gonna see you again, I know, but… we had like an arc together! We had an arc, and now it’s over. *sniff*
我知道我会再见到你的，但是...我们本应一起冒险的故事，一起为了正义而奋斗的故事，现在要结束了。*哭泣*
Aww, don’t tempt me. But, um, I kinda had my Pokémon tussle with Tamarind back there and they need to rest for now.
哎呀，不要妄图诱惑我，我的精灵刚刚才和塔玛琳打了一架，它们现在需要休息。
Maybe someday? Jeanne wants to kick your ass.
也许有一天？我是说也许，让娜想狠狠地揍你一顿呢。
Like, not your Pokémon. You. Sorry! Watch your back out there, I guess.
大概...不是你的精灵，是你本人！对不起...在外面一定要注意安全。
Oh!
哦
Um, listen, you’re really cute but I’m not really... into you?
嗯，听着，虽然你真的很可爱，但我还没喜欢你到那种程度。
I’m, like, super into the sweep me off my feet romance story kinda thing?
我只是...大概...那种喜欢浪漫故事的人。
Like, theoretically if I needed to disguise myself while bad guys were searching and I had someone I could kiss to hide my face. Y’know. Cliche stuff.
大概...打个比方，如果我得在坏人追查时隐藏自身，我能做出亲吻某个陌生人来挡住我的脸之类的事情那种相当老套的情节。
But, um, I’m not, like, into actual relationships? If that makes sense?
但我不是真的喜欢恋爱关系，如果你能明白我的意思。
No! We, like, didn’t learn anything from this.
不！我们大概...的的确确，没有因此做出太多改变。
We un-learned things.
我们只是读懂了反面教材。
Listen, we are, like, the dumbest people alive.
或许，我们大概...就是世界上最蠢的人。
That’s why we’re obsessed with justice and, um, kinda impulsive!
这就是为什么我们一直醉心于所谓的正义...抱歉，有点冲动了。
Mainly me, but you too. I know it. We’re twinsies.
主要是我，但你也是，我知道，我们是彼此的镜子。
...I’m gonna miss the hell out of you.
...我会非常想念你的。
I know, I know! I’m not, like, going-going. But, like, it feels that way. And I miss you already. Hug?
我知道，我知道！这不是永别，这不是！但，感觉没什么差别...我已经开始想你了...我们能...抱一下吗？
Um... \PN? I’m, not, like, the healthiest person? Like, in the head.
嗯...\PN，我...大概...是不是...根本不是1个心理正常人？
I’ve done some pretty iffy stuff myself because I was, like, well, this is for justice.
因为自身觉得那样是正义就做出那些糟糕的事情...
Like that makes it OK.
谢谢，我好多了。
So, um, maybe working with Tamarind is a way for me to get justice for myself, too? And, yeah, I could probably use some therapy too.
所以，嗯，也许和塔玛琳一起工作是我寻求正义的另一种方式？可能我需要一些心理治疗。
And I understand if you don’t wanna be my friend after hearing that, but, um, I hope I see you again anyways. I’m gonna make things better.
如果你听完刚刚这些后不愿再跟我做朋友，我也能理解，但是，我还是希望能再见到你。我会拼尽全力让一切变得更好。
You go stop Yezera. Make sure all my hard work doesn’t get, like, undone, OK?
叶泽拉只能拜托你去阻止了，以确保我的辛劳不会白费，好吗？
Thank you, \PN. I… I gotta go. But I hope I see you again. Thanks for showing me what justice is.
谢谢你，\PN。我...我这次真得走了。我真的希望能再见到你。谢谢你让我懂得了什么才是正义。
...Ugh, that was cheesy. I, um, yeah. Love you. Toodles.
...啊，这太肉麻了。我...我...我...我喜欢你，拜拜。
You’re cool. You’re, like, my favorite person.
你是我见过最酷的人，你是我最喜欢的人。
I know you’ve still got, like, a lot of stuff to do, so go do it.
我知道你还有很多事情去做，我会永远为你加油。
I’ve got stuff to do, too. If Tamarind wasn’t waiting I’d, like, hug you for an hour.
现在我也有必须要做的事情了，如果不是塔玛琳在等我，我大概...会让你再抱我1个小时。
But, um, gotta go, I guess. You’re... we’ll see each other again? Right? Yeah. Of course we will.
但是，我真的真的得走了，你...我们会再见面对吧？一定会的。
I, um, yeah. Love you. Bye. Toodles!
我是不是啰嗦太多了...但我还是想最后再说一句，我喜欢你，再见！
Oh, so it’s you again. You’ve arrived at a rather fortuitous time.
哦，又是你。你来得正是时候。
I’ve caught this pair of Makyan forms and would like some more data – but excuse me. Again, my manners.
我捕捉到了这些马凯亚形态正打算进一步观测战斗数据...哦，抱歉，请原谅我的失礼
May I ask your name?
我还不知道你的名字？
Ah, \PN. I’ve heard that name about. A pleasure to meet you properly this time.
啊，\PN。我听说过这个名字，请允许我正式地向你问好。
How droll. I suppose I am a stranger, after all, though.
没错，我忘了，真的很抱歉。
As I was saying: I would like some combat data. You seem to be quite adept at providing it.
正如我刚刚所说：我需要一些战斗数据，这应该是你很擅长的事情吧？
Shall we?
让我们直接开始？
Of course. I wouldn’t want the results to be tainted.
当然，我不想得到受其他因素干扰的结论。
Adaptation via vendetta – I’m expecting viciousness. Let’s see.

Shall we get down to it?
我们开始吧？
Highly educational.

It would seem that both of them have been honed by their vendetta.
看起来它们2个都被仇恨磨练得更强了。
From what I’ve gleaned in local sources, the Sevipers became Steel-type to fend off Zangoose.
根据当地收集的信息来看，饭匙蛇为了抵抗天敌猫鼬斩演化出了钢属性。
They managed to drive the local Zangoose populations to extinction, yet even that didn’t stop the feud.
它们想方设法清除了这里的死敌，但这并没能让一切结束。
Fighting until they died, and then even beyond. The tenacity of the Zangoose is admirable, no?
猫鼬斩的韧性也令人钦佩，它们没有选择就此逃散，而是战斗到用尽最后一丝力气。
The Zangoose counter-adaptation – the Fighting-type – seems to be a product of their indestructible spirit.
正是在这样屹立不倒的信念支持下它们逐渐演化出了能反制仇敌的格斗属性。
Curious. Could these be the predators the Furrets adapted to beat?
不过这样的演化好像对被捕食的大尾立更有利？
No, the Psychic type would hurt as much as help.
也不对，超能属性会帮倒忙的。
A mystery for another time. I would like to thank you for your help, but actions speak louder than words.
这就是另1个需要时间验证的谜团了。我想比起口头感谢，你更喜欢这个。
Take this, from my homeland.

If you want some proof that I really am trying my damnedest to make this place better, take this.
如果你想要确保我真的在尽我所能让这个地区变得更好，那就拿上这个。
It’s a lab where some stuff went down. None of it my fault.
这是1个遭到了破坏的实验室，但这不是我的问题。
On top of everything else, I’ve been keeping extradimensional monsters at bay out of the kindness of my heart.
除此之外，我还一直保护着这个地区免受超维度怪物的侵袭，这完全是我自发的行为。
Really.
真的。
I do want the best for this place. Hopefully once you see all the work I’ve done that’ll be obvious.
我确实希望这个地区变得更好，一旦你亲眼看到我所做的一切，就不会再怀疑我。
But, um, I know I’m not really wanted right now, so I’ll be going.
但是，嗯，我知道大家现在并不愿接受我，所以我就选择了离开。
You... you did the right thing, kid.
你...你做得对，孩子。

To be honest, I was nervous -- being the returning champion and all. I suppose that will be you soon enough.
其实，我很紧张...因为你估计很快就能成为冠军，而我是去年得到的这个头衔。
Ah, I recognize you. You're the new Trainer blazing through the Makyan Gym Challenge.
啊，我认得你，你是最近在道馆挑战中声名鹊起的训练师。
At the rate you're going, I have no doubt that you'll be attending this year's tournament?
按照你现在的进度，我确信你肯定来得及参加今年的锦标赛.
To be honest, I'm a little nervous -- being the returning champion and all.
老实说，你让我有点紧张 - 毕竟我是卫冕冠军。
My name's Elise.
我叫伊莉丝。
I normally just run things around here at the castle. Not too unlike my ancestors of old, minus the whole royalty deal.
我通常就在这座城堡里打理事务，跟我的先祖们差不多，只是没有皇室身份罢了。
Well, while you're here...
既然今天你出现在了这里...
Want to have a friendly battle? It'll help us both to stay in form.
要不要一场友谊赛？这能帮助我们保持状态。
Oh, no worries then. I'll just uhh...
好吧，没有关系，只是...
Stay here, I guess.
我会在这里等着的。
Excellent! Let's go!
太棒了！我们上吧！
Hmm, your title is certainly earned.
嗯，你的实力配得上现在的名气。
I guess I'll have to train even harder. Another year, another shot.
我想我必须翻倍努力地训练，一点一点地变得更强。
Hmm, it looks like I'll have some stiff competition this year.
嗯，看样子今年的竞争会很激烈。
I guess I'll have to train even harder.
我必须更加努力地训练了。
In the meantime though, I think I know of someone who would like to meet you.
除此之外，我想...某个人或许很想见你一面。
Vincent, another Makyan Champion, is apparently looking for strong Trainers.
马凯亚的另一位前冠军文森特，他正在寻找强大的训练师。
He's usually found around Aquatopia, which is on the western side of the city.
你可以在西宏礼市的水世界找到他。
Farewell Trainer. I'll be seeing you soon.
训练师，下次再见。我想这不会隔太久。
After Team Chasm stopped their less savory activities, things have been a little strange.
自从裂隙队被迫解散后，情况就变得有些奇怪了。
Besides the occasional showmatch, there's very little for royalty to do.
除了偶尔参加表演赛外，皇室成员都天天无事可做。
Before this, Team Chasm would always approach me with some deal or threat. While I don't miss it, I can say it was a motivation for staying sharp.
在那之前，裂隙队总会以交易或威胁为手段来接近我。我并不是怀念这些，只是将其作为保持敏锐的动力。
Ah well, I suppose I should pick up a second hobby. Let's battle again one day, Trainer.
或许，我应该再找1个爱好。改天我们再战吧，训练师。
This clown sucks.
这个小丑太差劲了。
I need to get a hobby, I can't spend all day like this.
我需要找1个爱好，不能整天这样浑浑噩噩。
Ignore it.
不理他。
Make a funny face.
做个鬼脸。
Take its candy.
抢走它的糖果。
Nah.
不要。
Sure.
好的。
Not right now.
现在不行。
Yeah, let's go.
来吧。

I’m stealing Regidrago.

I don’t – I’m not going to lie. I’m unsealing the things I helped reinter, and… I don’t know.
我不会撒谎...我正在解封我曾经帮忙封印的东西...但我不知道后果会如何。
I don’t know what to tell you.
我不知道该怎么告诉你。
I could try and convince you that I’m doing the right thing.
我可以试着说服你我在做正确的事情。
I could – I could tell you so many reasons and justifications and… it wouldn’t matter.
我可以...可以告诉你很多理由，用各种方法辩解，但这都没有用。
We’re going to fight anyways. I’m not going to go easy on you – I can’t afford to.
我们无论如何都要战斗，我不会手下留情...我承受不起。
So… try to make sure they don’t – keep your Pokémon safe. I don’t want to hurt them. I just need to buy a little time.
所以...请确保他们不会受伤...保护好你的精灵。我不想伤害它们，我只需要拖延一点时间。
I… I’m in far too deep at this point to back out.
我已经陷入泥潭了，没有抽身的可能。
Good. I don’t… I don’t want to hurt you, either.
好的，我也...不想伤害你。
Don’t expect a fair fight. I’m sorry, but I – I have to do this.
不要意味这是场公平战斗。很抱歉，但我必须这样做。
…Yeah. Me too.
没错，我...
Well, here goes. Artemisia, take the lead.
好了，开始吧。蒿蒿，出击。
Don’t dive too deep – we’re getting out of here soon. Fend them off.
不要进去了，我们很快就会离开这里。抵挡住它们。
But if they put up a fight… crush them.
但如果它们反抗...就粉碎它们。
I can't - you make Alessa look like a rank-and-file grunt.

Well. I've gotten what I came for; slowed you down.
好了，我已经得到我想要的了，拖延了足够多的时间。
I'm… glad to be your rival. Thanks.

I – uhf. I crippled one of their teams, but they got away. They’re good, dammit. And I’m out of practice.
我...呃...我打败了他们中的1个，但让他们逃走了。他们很强...该死！我也生疏了...
Here – I can heal your Pokémon. Mine are going to need a little care before I’m ready to move out. But you go on ahead. Here.
来，我可以治愈你的精灵。在出发之前，我的精灵需要休息一会儿，但你可以先上，这里。
You’ll use them better than I can.
你会比我用得更好。
Now go after them.
现在去追他们。
The door is tightly locked.
门被紧紧锁住了。
…Yezera, why would you – oh, \PN. Yeah, I can help heal your Pokémon.
...叶泽拉，你为什么要...哦，\PN。我可以帮助治愈你的精灵。
Now go deeper into the catacombs, one of them is still down there.
现在进入地下墓穴吧，他们有1个人还待在里面。
Nobody followed you? Good.
没有人跟着你？很好。
You know those weird caves around Makya?
你知道马凯亚周围那些奇怪的洞穴吗？
Desert with canals like circuit boards, or a mine where steel floor grows naturally.
像电路板一样的运河沙漠，或者自然生长着钢铁地板的矿山。
Those are where the Regis are entombed. They’re Pokémon of incredible power that Team Chasm used to dominate the region.
那里是巨人的墓地，他们是极其强大的精灵，裂隙队曾经就是用它们来统治这个地区的。
My hands ain’t clean on that, either, and now someone’s trying to break out my old bruiser: Regidrago.
当然我也难辞其咎，现在有人试图解放那个老家伙：雷吉铎拉戈。
We don’t know who, and we don’t know why, but that thing was buried for a reason.
我们不知道他们是谁，也不知道为什么要这么做，但那个东西并不是无缘无故被封印的。
Because Yezera told us to, and because we – I’ll explain later. Time’s of the essence.
是叶泽拉让我们封印它们的，因为我们...我等会再解释，时间紧迫。
Yeah, and I’m sorry for not cluing you in earlier, but what’s done is done.
是的，很抱歉没有早点让你知道，但一切已经发生了。
We need to move, now, if we’re gonna catch whoever’s in there.
如果我们想要抓住那个人的话，就必须赶紧行动。
I can pull some strings, make sure you can catch up to your brother.
我可以帮你一些忙，让你能够更快地追上你的兄弟。
And if you don’t help, maybe the opposite. So quit whinging and help.
如果你不帮忙，也许会有相反的结果，所以别抱怨了，答应吧。
Follow me. If there’s a fight, you take point and I’ll flank. I’m good, but I’m not that good.
跟着我，我实力很强...但强得有限。如果有战斗，你走在前面，我会从侧面进攻。
They’re in the catacombs.
他们在地下墓穴里。
The door Regidrago’s locked behind should be impenetrable, but… let’s go check it out.
雷吉铎拉戈锁住的门应该是无法打开的，但...还是让我们去看看吧。
Just to make sure.
只是为了确认一下。
Let me pass.
让我过去

You know the first champion of Makya? I heard she lost her arm by feeding it to a starving Pokemon.
你知道马凯亚地区的第一位冠军吗？我听说她把自身的胳膊喂给了一只快要饿死的精灵。

I smuggled some dynamite into the city, but I think the cops are onto me.

The natural soot here is perfect for my Bellossom!
这边的纯天然火山灰对我的美丽花很有用！
The stuff near factories usually have chemicals in them, so I can't use those.
但工厂附近的那些通常含有些杂七杂八的化学物质，所以我不敢随便用那些。
A tattered and locked door.

Big ol' conspiracy, huh? Been lied to? Yeah, well, comes with the territory. Better get suited to it.
发现那个大阴谋了？感觉自身被骗了？嗯，这是常有的事，最好习惯一下。
'Course. We’re confidants, Yezera and I. Nearly decked her when she told me, too.
的确，我和叶泽拉是密友，她告诉我打算做的一切时，我差点没忍住揍她一顿。
But she always was the smarter one 'tween us. Who the hell am I to second-guess her?
但她一直是我们俩中更聪明的那个，我有什么资格去怀疑她呢？
Maybe I am, maybe I ain't. Don't matter much, do it? You plannin' on arresting me? Hah.
或许吧，谁知道呢，那不重要，还是说，你打算逮捕我？哈。
Looking right as rain, ain'tcha? Heard from a fortune teller that you’ve got a steel core to you.

But, uh, you ain't exactly the kid that strutted into Novo, cocky as all get-out.
不过，你已经不是之前那个，在望新镇自以为是的小孩了。
Still cocky. Got some ice to you, too, though.
虽然还是有些自以为是，起码比之前冷静很多。
Wasn’t plannin’ on inviting you out here to chat, though.
不过我不是邀请你来这种地方聊天的。
Goes like this: Yezera’s about to do somethin’ real stupid.
你应该也知道一些：叶泽拉要做一些不折不扣的傻事。
I ain’t bright enough to know if her plan’s worth it or not. Figure that’ll be settled with a duel – ain’t no other way for the likes of us.
我不够聪明，分不清她的计划是否值得，我想这将通过决斗来解决 - 对于我们这样的人来说，没有其他的办法，不是吗？
And she’ll be facin’ one of us, so why don’t we get some training done?
她总要面对我们当中的一人，那不如趁此机会训练训练吧。
Don’tcha burn yourself out now. Push yourself too hard and ya might just snap.

Oh, I oughta let you know: used to be I did bounty hunting for Chasm. I ain't about to play fair or clean.
现在我也应该说明白一些了：我曾经为裂隙队做过黑手套，所以我不会遵守所谓的“公平”。
I only play for keeps.

Ya ready?
准备好了吗？
Eh.

I’ve fought better in my time, ain’t no question 'bout it.

Kid, answer me somethin’. How do ya feel about Yezera?
小家伙，回答我1个问题，你是怎么看待叶泽拉的？
Ain’t much of an answer. I like her too, mind you; maybe a li'l too much.
这答案有点模糊了吧？不过我也喜欢她...或许喜欢得还有点太多了。
Figures. She ain’t easy to love sometimes, y’know? Goes double for when she’s up to somethin’ like this.
很正常，毕竟大家跟她之间总有不能相互理解的地方，尤其她现在还在做这些事。
Well, how 'bout that. You can tell I like ya, 'cause I ain’t even gonna hurt you for sayin’ that.
哼哼，看来你能看得出，我对你感觉也挺不错的，不会因为这句话而物理上揍你一顿。
'Cause she betrayed you? Or 'cause she’s obnoxious?
因为她背叛了你？还是单纯讨厌她的个性？
Or, heh, 'cause she keeps givin’ you a run for your money?
又或者她一直让你很头疼？
Don’t really matter what you say. If wishes were Rhyhorn, yeah?
不管怎么说都无所谓了，毕竟嘴是会骗人的。
We’ll see which side of the line ya fall on when it comes down to it.
等到真正需要选择的时候，我们就能看出你站在哪一边了。
Gotta strong urge to say somethin’ heartfelt – guess I’m gettin’ sappy.
我最近有一种强烈的愿望想说些真挚的话 - 也许我变得感性了吧。
Like I said, though, words are cheap. Take these.
算了，说再多也没用，拿上这些。
I’ll see ya 'round. Don’t you worry 'bout finding me. I’ll find you 'fore the end.
再见了，别担心找不到我，因为我会主动来找你的。
Then we’ll settle what to do 'bout Yez. Love that girl...

But now I have a nice place for myself here. It pays well and it's easy on my body.

The region doesn't have a traditional Elite Four, and Gym Leaders here aren't exactly career Trainers either.
这个地区没有传统的四天王，这里的道馆馆主也不是精英训练师。
Some especially harsh critics have claimed that the whole thing is simply a front for a rebranding of Team Chasm.
一些极其严苛的批评家声称这一切都只是1个经过重新包装的裂隙队。
They're right, but not in the way they think.

Obviously I'm biased since I'm former Chasm myself, but I really do think the League here is a real attempt at going legit.
当然，我的观点未必客观，毕竟我自身就曾是裂隙队的一员，但我真的认为现在的联盟正在一步步尝试着走向合规。

Pokemon battling, cliff face cycling, what's life without a little thrill?
精灵对战与悬崖骑行，没点刺激怎么能算生活呢？
Maybe I should talk to my Arctozolt about coming back to life.
或许我应该跟我的雷鸟海兽聊聊关于生活的看法。
That sounds like an exciting experience.
毕竟它有过复活的经历。

Have you come to this peak seeking my advice? To receive it, you must first impress me in battle.
你是来这座山上寻求建议的吗？那就来打败我吧。
Oh hoh! You're ready for my advice. Too bad I blew my shoulder and need immediate medical attention.

The shipment of fruit from Frostflow got done without a hitch.

Or so I thought. This here Bounsweet tagged along, the rascal, and now I don't know what to do with it.
至少我是这么认为的。这个捣蛋的甜竹竹跟着来了，现在我真不知道该怎么处理它。
It may be cute, but I'm raising enough Pokemon back at the farm as is.

Yo, homeboss, we are Chara and Scilla's number one fans. We study all their techniques.

I tried to escape through the tunnel here, but I forgot that it's blocked up by that stupid Virizion.
我本打算通过这里的隧道过去，但被那只毕力吉翁吓到了。
Then these avatars appeared and I just... I just panicked.

A loss this bad means I have to train at the Ironclad Dojo.
如此惨痛的失败...我得去钢铁道场锻炼了。
If Casey won't train me, I'll get another former champion to do it instead!
既然凯斯不愿帮我训练，那我就去找另一位前冠军！
Excellent spar, Trainer! You should talk to Chara in Sweetrock if you're headed there.

My peaceful stroll was inturrupted by a legendary avatar. Wonderful.

You seem strong, maybe you can deal with it?
你看起来很强，也许你能处理掉它？
What? Come to gloat?

C’mon, let’s get you out of here. We can take care of this.
走吧，我们把你带出去，然后一起解决这个问题。
Go deal with the issue – you’re the better duelist. He’s down in the lower area causing havoc.
去处理下面那个家伙，你的水准更高，阻止他让整个地区陷入混乱。
You take care of that, I’ll help Samorn. Move it, Slowpoke.
你去处理那个家伙，我来帮塞蒙，快点笨蛋！
These ruins are old, but not as old as the mountain itself.
这些遗迹再古老也比不过这座山。
Whoever they were, they must have dug extensive tunnels with pre-industrial technology.
所以也就代表了，古人拥有非常先进的挖掘技术。
Either that, or something powerful created an entire mountain on top of them.
总不至于是什么强大的力量，将这座山盖在遗迹上的吧！
Oh, it’s you.
哦，是你啊。
As you might’ve heard, you’re too late.
或许你已经意识到了...
Again.
你 又 来 晚 了。
Our tasks are complete, and now we play the waiting game. But I’m… not patient.
我的工作都已经完成了，现在只要等下1个时机，不过我...闲不住。
Look at these statues – monuments to monuments! Idiocy! They’re begging to be destroyed.
看这些愚蠢的雕像和纪念碑，长着一副想被炸毁的样！
Shh. If you won’t be a placid audience, you’ll be escorted out.
嘘，不该问的别问，不然你就会被请出去。
Testaments of an age.
旧时代的见证罢了。
Delicate as ever. Fine. Cease bothering me.
还是跟以前一样无趣，随便，爱干嘛就干嘛吧。
What’s the point of resisting, or creating? We’re going to pave it all over anyways.
抵抗或创造有什么意义呢？反正我们最终会把它们都铲平。
And I don’t mean that philosophically. I will replace all of this with malleable white stone personally.
我可不是要跟你讨论哲学，我会亲自用可塑的白石头来代替这一切。
A blank slate.
将其变为一张白纸。
Unlike Yezera, my perfect world is one in which human whim gets what it deserves.
我才不会在乎叶泽拉想怎样，反正我要创造1个由人类的心血打造的完美世界。
Speaking of which, you’ve yet to be crushed underfoot. Let’s fix that.
不过现在，还没能把你踩在脚下，对我来说可是莫大的遗憾啊！
…Well there goes Registeel. Hard to keep a hold of, those ones.
...雷吉斯奇鲁又跑了，这些家伙一直都很难控制。
What can I say? I’m… only human, after all.
我又能说什么呢？我...也不过是个普通人罢了。
Fine. It can rust away in its tomb for all I care. It’s irrelevant now.
随便了，让它在坟墓中生锈吧，现在已经不需要它了。
I'm out of here.
我走咯。
An item was left on the ground!
好像掉了什么东西！
Hey.
嘿。
I, uh, heard everything when you fought that guy.
我，呃...我听到你们说的了...
Yeah, yeah. Just scraped up a little. Nothing a Heal Pulse can’t fix.
啊，没事，只是擦伤，用治愈脉冲就能解决了。
Can’t tell if you’re being a sarcastic snot or not.
我总觉得你在挖苦我。
Doesn’t really matter. You’re welcome.
无所谓了，不用谢。
Hey, listen, this’ll only take a minute.
别急，给我一分钟的时间。
I just wanted to tell you… hell, is that really how I sound?
我只是想问...玛德，你是怎么看待我的？
Like that edgelord? Just another self-absorbed prick?
就跟刚才那个黄毛刺头似的？就这么不受你待见？
Heh. You’re squirrellier than a Furret sometimes.
呵呵，你有时候比大尾立还要神经。
Ah, you don’t have to tell me. I know.
行了，你不用再说了。
No sugarcoating it, huh?
毫不掩饰，是吗？
Yeah. That’s fair.
也对，很合理。
You’re being polite even now? Or are you actually telling the truth?
你只是跟我客气客气，还是真的这么想？
Listen, it really hurt admitting that you’re better than me back there. As a trainer, I mean.
的确，承认你比我强让我很难受，我...我是说作为训练师。
But somebody had to fight and somebody had to get Samorn out, and I’m a lot of things but I’m not stupid.
但必须要有人战斗，必须要有人把塞蒙救出来，我的确性子可能不太好，但我不是头不分轻重的蠢猪。
You’ve always been better. I knew it, Mom knew it, and you… I hope you know it.
你一直都比我更优秀，我知道，妈妈也知道，你...我希望你也能知道。
This entire competition was stupid. Mom knew you’d win.
这场所谓的比试就是场愚蠢的作秀，大家都知道你会获胜。
This was just a scheme so she could finally prove you’re better than me.
这只是妈妈为了证明这一点，拿来给董事会看的一项计划罢了。
…Yeah.
也是...
You know Mavis as well as I do.
你和梅维斯一样了解我。
I mean, yeah, makes sense. She wants an heir to the company… to the legacy… you fit.
我是说...没错，更合理，她想要1个公司的继承人...继承家族的一切...你很合适。
You know it is. Mavis is just as cutthroat as Helena – hell, maybe more.
你也知道，梅维斯和海伦娜一样冷酷无情...甚至更甚。
You think a normal mom would encourage her kids to have a showdown a continent away?
你认为1个正常的妈妈会鼓励她的孩子在遥远的地方进行一场所谓的决斗吗？
Hah!
哈！
It’s just that easy for you, huh?
你觉得这是件容易的事？
You’re right, of course. Just took me a lot more mulling it over to get to that point.
或许你是对的，但以我目前的理解，我不认为能就此结束。
I’m calling this whole thing off. It’s stupid and I’m not playing that game anymore.
没错，我不想再玩这种愚蠢的家族竞争游戏了！
I’m going to collect my badges, do my best in the Championship, and then I’m leaving.
但我还会收集徽章，在锦标赛中拼尽全力，然后想去哪儿就去哪儿。
You can tell Mavis whatever you want. She’ll offer you a job at her side.
不管你想怎么跟梅维斯说都可以，反正她会给你安排好一切。
Take it or leave it, your choice. But I’m out.
你怎么想那是你自身的事，但是我已经决定了。
Thanks. Gonna need it, honestly.
谢谢，老实说，这句话才是我真正需要的东西。
Yeah. Sure as anything.
没错，再无回头的可能。
Ha. Maybe, yeah.
哈，也许吧。
But I’d rather be called a yellow-bellied spoilt rich kid than Mavis’s second-favorite.
我就算被称为1个懦弱的纨绔子弟，也不想成为梅维斯的“第二重要”。
Gonna be honest: don’t really care. Like I said, you do what you want.
随意吧，我不太在乎。就像刚才说的，你自身爱咋样咋样。
But, yeah, I’ve been thinking about this for a while, and that whole debacle back there with Samorn… I’m out.
但...总之，我已经考虑很久了，包括刚才的混乱...我都退出。
I’m not gonna do the whole edgy trainer pushing as hard as possible shtick.
我不想做什么极端的训练师，我只想尽可能地增加自身。
I do really hate you sometimes, but that’s siblings for you.
有时候我真的很讨厌你，但这或许就是兄弟之间的关系。
Had a Hymnus to try out against you, too. Shame.
本来还想用Hymnus和你对战的。真遗憾。
…Bye, \PN. I’ll see you around. Good luck… saving the world, or whatever you’re doing.
再见了，\PN。也祝你...拯救世界也好，或者正在做的其他事情也罢，一切都顺利，好运吧。。

不管幕后黑手是谁，这档子事也 足 够 无 聊！还不如去喝着啤酒看摔跤呢！
Sheezy, ain't you a little battlin' freak! Would've ran me and my squad broke in the ol' days.

The mystery they present, the implications it has for Makyan history...
它们所呈现出的那些，蕴含着历史影响的谜团...
I couldn't bring myself to leave, even when the Team disbanded.
即便我们的队伍已经解散了，我也不想就此离开这里。
Ow! Oh, don’t you worry. I’m only bruised.
哎呀！哦，别担心。只是轻微擦伤而已。
Is that the badge my grandma gives out? That means you beat her right?
那是我奶奶发的徽章吗？这意味着你打败了她，对吧？
That's hype! When I get better, I'm gonna find you for a rematch.
太棒了！等我变强了，我会找你复仇的。
If I'm gonna inherit the Gym one day, I'll have to be able to give Trainers like you a run for their money.
如果有一天我要继承这个体育馆，我必须能够像你这样的训练师一样出色。

Hello, \PN.
你好，\PN。
I’m sorry. I’ve invited you here under false pretenses.
很抱歉，我用1个假借口把你骗来这边了。
In my research I noted you and a certain individual meeting several times.
在研究过程中，我注意到了1个跟你有过几次交集的人。
I would later discover her to be the former Champion, Yezera.
后来才发现她是前冠军叶泽拉。
I have reason to believe she is behind the emergence of the avatars.
我有充足的理由相信她就是化身出现的幕后黑手。
I understand you may be unwilling to part with any information you have concerning this. I suggest a duel.
我知道你可能不愿意透露太多，那我们不妨靠决斗来决定吧！
The loser will tell the victor the whole truth.
输家要向胜者透露全部真相。
Good.
很好。
That may be so. Dedicated trainers seem to have some kind of honor to their matches, though.
或许吧，但对训练师来说，这样的比试也有关荣誉感不是吗？
I would like to ensure you are telling me everything. It seems as if a loss may compel you to reveal what you would otherwise hide.
我想确保能得知我想要的一切，如果你输了，我可能会问一些更深入的问题。
Those are my conditions. I will fight you before I have anything more to do with you.
这只是我的条件，在我们相互坦白前的战斗。
If you would like to leave, you may.
如果你实在不愿意，我也没有什么办法。
Yes. What honor compels you trainers is beyond me.
的确，我很难以自身的思维，理解你们训练师的荣誉感。
I plan to uphold my end of the deal, though. I believe your bizarre code of conduct will force you to, as well.
我会遵守我们的协议，我同时相信你们奇怪的行为准则也会迫使你这样做。
Now, if you would like time to prepare, or simply to escape, do so now.
所以，无论你需要时间准备，还是就此逃跑，趁现在吧。
If not, then we shall duel.
如果不需要，那就开始吧。
Go. I’ll wait.
好吧，我会在这里等你。
I understand you are the current Champion. I am more skilled than you may expect, though.
我知道你是现任冠军，不过，我比你想象中更强。
You returned. Are you ready?
你回来了，准备好了？
Yes, well, I suppose I expected this. The odds of beating a Champion were low.
是啊，我早就想到了，想打败冠军没那么容易。
I did the best I could, and now I will tell you the whole truth. Maybe your response will tell me what I want to know.
我已经尽力了，愿赌服输，现在我会告诉你全部真相，也许你的回应也能告诉我我想知道的答案。
I have discovered the locations of at least four of the five Regi tombs.
我已经找到4个巨人墓穴的位置了。
I am also aware of Yezera’s abduction of the Regis, and that some part of her plan has caused the avatars. My final finding is that... none of it matters.
我也知道叶泽拉带走了它们，她的计划导致了化身的出现，但我的最终发现是...这一切都没有意义。
Not for my purposes.
对于我的目的来说没有意义。
Makya is a large, vibrant ecosystem. The pressures which generate a new regional form are more complicated than one can simply infer.
马凯亚拥有1个庞大且充满活力的生态系统，这里新的地区形态的出现，比人们的想象和推断更复杂。
In my pride, I thought an outsider’s perspective could unravel this mystery.
或许是因为我的自负，以为以1个局外人的视角，能解开这里的谜团。
The Regis, the avatars, the regional forms – all connected, of course, but not cleanly. The world is not a clean place.
巨人、化身、地区形态...我相信它们之间都有所联系，但这种联系又并不直观，显然这个世界并没有那么干净。
I am glad you agree. If you had a simple solution I had missed, I would be rather embarrassed.
我很高兴你能认可，如果我忽略了什么明显的点...光是想想就觉得尴尬。
Even a negative result is worth determining for certain. I don’t have answers. I do have experience, and data.
即便是不好的结果，也值得大家去研究、确定，我虽然没能得到答案，但积累了足够的经验和数据。
Yes. I plan to prove my abilities in more realistic ways than solving an entire region’s mysteries.
没错，所以我计划，用比起解决地区的谜题，更为现实的方法证明自身的能力。
I don’t. I’ve determined my problem. Now I’m fixing it.
我并不会自责，现在已经确定了摆在面前的问题，只要一点点解决它就好了。
But I am also not finished, as I have only told you half the truth.
但即便如此我也没有完成目标...我现在也只说了一半真相而已。
My challenge and this location were for a higher purpose.
我做这一切有着更高的目的。
I noted Makya’s vast diversity of species and set my sights on a particular trio. Prior to this moment, they have only been found in an extremely specific locale.
为了更加了解马凯亚的物种多样性，我把目光投向了它们3个...这三种之前只在1个特定地区出现过的精灵。
But, drawn by the sound of brutal conflict, in a place such as this...
可它们又为什么被这样1个 充满残酷冲突的地方吸引来呢？

芳草与奇幻
Conflict against a hero such as you, in a location similar to their home such as this, draws them out.
在这样1个类似它们家园的地方，与你这样的英雄的一场对战，正好能把它们吸引出来。
I have been untrue, however. I have fought you before. I was masked.
而且，我...还隐瞒了一件事，之前我...就和你战斗过...我戴着面具的时候。
I have determined I have made a mistake there, too. Primordial truth would elude us even if the world is reverted. There is no point.
但我已经认识到自身的错误了，就算世界恢复原初状态，真理也会离我们而去，毫无意义。
The world is complicated, and always has been. My inability to solve such a relatively-trivial mystery suggests my plan was foolish.
世界一直都是如此的复杂...我无法解决这样的谜团，也就此证明了我的愚蠢。
Please excuse my repeated deceptions. I did, in fact, determine quite a bit of this on my own.
请原谅我一而再的隐瞒，实际上...至少今天，我已经把该说的都告诉你了。
The nature of the regional forms is still a pursuit of mine. I plan to continue it, so Yezera must be stopped.
我会继续研究地区形态的问题，这是我一直在做的课题，所以，请一定阻止叶泽拉。
If you wish, I would suggest you take these birds of the battlefield with you. I planned to use them against you. Now I suggest the reverse.
如果你愿意，我建议你带上它们一起，可笑我曾经还打算用它们对付你，但现在，完全反过来了。
I will leave you to your preparations. I have many years of study left in Makya, and plan to not waste them.
等你准备好之后，就来收下它们吧，我还会在这里学习研究几年。
I rest easy knowing you will not let my efforts be in vain. Goodbye, \PN.
将一切交给你我很放心，我知道你不会让我的努力白费，再见，\PN。
There they are. Bringers of carnage.
它们就在这儿，带来屠杀的使者。
Only a battle against a Champion in an environ similar to their home might draw them out, if they lurked here at all.
只有在类似它们家园的环境中，与冠军级别的英雄战斗，才可能将潜伏在附近的它们引出来。
I have confirmed my hypothesis, and can rest easy.
当然这只是个假设，现在假设已被验证，我也可以放心了。
If you wish to catch them, or merely fight them, you may do so. I will leave you to your amusements.
无论你想抓住它们还是仅仅与它们战斗，那就是你自身的选择了。
Goodbye, \PN. Thank you. I have many more years of study left in Makya, thanks to you.
再见，\PN。谢谢你，多亏了你，我在马凯亚的研究得以继续下去。
Fine.
好吧
I'd tell you anyways.
本就没打算隐瞒
No.
我拒绝
Seems unenforceable.
这办不到
Give me a minute.
给我一分钟
I'm ready now.
准备好了
That's true.
确实
So it was pointless?
所以就没意义？
Pride is right.
自信很正常
Don't beat yourself up.

I was a bit scared cause I heard how tough Samorn is.
一开始我有些胆战心惊的，大家都知道塞蒙有多强。
She's the strongest gym leader in the whole region!
她是这个地区最强的道馆馆主！
But she's really nice. I had a great time.
但她平日很是和善，悬着的心终于放下了。
Oh! I knew I’d find you here, my hero.
我就知道会在这里遇到你，我的英雄。
You’re looking particularly ravishing today.
你今天看起来真迷人。
Your gaze is like a summer night... getting me all hot under the collar.
你的目光就像夏夜一样...让我感到又闷又热。
Excuse my directness. I’m getting carried away. Hello, \PN.
抱歉，请原谅我的直白，我有点失控了...咳...你好，\PN。
Strange days. Strange days indeed! There’s an excitement in the air.
今天是个奇怪的日子！我能闻到空气中的兴奋感。
Oh, don’t flatter me. It’ll go straight to my head.
哦，别太夸我，我会骄傲的。
Aww, have I upset you? Please, I don’t mean a word of it, if that’s what you want to hear.
啊，我让你感到难受了吗？那抱歉，刚才的话都当是谎话吧。
...It’s been a long day. I get... flustered after days like these. Sorry.
...今天是漫长的一天，像这样的日子让我有点慌乱。
A certain trainer you may know grabbed me by the collar. Then she told me in detail what she’d do to me if I ever laid my hands on Yezera.
或许你也认识某个训练师，她会抓住我的衣领警告我，如果我敢碰叶泽拉就怎样怎样的。
Now, as much as I might like to do exactly that... I haven’t. And won’t. She’s unattainable.
尽管我很想这样做...但我并没有出手，也不会出手，她是可望而不可及的。
Sorry, sorry. Let me explain myself. As much as I can.
抱歉，抱歉，让我来尽可能地解释一下。
Oh, for sure! She’s so appealing because of her reclusiveness. Oh, to rehabilitate her with endless kindness.
没错，当然是这样！尤其是最后的选择，真吸引人，用无尽的善意让她慢慢恢复。
Who isn’t? So tremulous, so frail, yet so powerful. Don’t you want to hug her back to health?
谁不是呢？如此娇羞脆弱，却又如此强大...你不想拥抱她，让她恢复健康吗？
Oh, now, yes, of course. Don’t be jealous. You’ve got all her verve and aren’t as... high-maintenance.
诶呀，不要嫉妒嘛、你拥有着她所有的活力，而且...没那么难相处。
You see, I used to be obsessed with her. It’s why I’m here.
所以，这就是我曾经迷恋她，但现在出现在这里的原因。
I could be the one to track her down, lure her out like a timid beast. I just wanted to take care of her.
我只是想照顾她，也愿意成为那个追踪她，像一只胆怯的野兽一样引诱她出来的人。
And she was beautiful, of course. I’m not so high- minded as to discount her graceful splendor as part of my reasoning.
当然，她也很美，我也不会高估自身的能力，不会将她优美的风度排除在我的行动之外。
But then I arrived here... and I found you. My attention was caught immediately.
但是当我来到这里...发现了你，我的注意力立刻被吸引了。
I’m so sorry. I just can’t really contain my feelings any longer. I like you. A lot. And I’d like you to be mine.
我很抱歉，但我无法再控制我的感情了，我喜欢你，非常喜欢，我想让你成为我的。
Shh. It’s OK. You’re confused and surprised and scared, but that’s alright.
你是觉得困惑、惊讶还是害怕？嘘...没事的，没关系的。
What’s life without a little fear? Adds a little color to proceedings, doesn’t it?
没有一点恐惧的人生算什么？它为生活增添了一点色彩，不是吗？
But I assure you my intentions are pure and loving.
我可以向你保证，我的意图是纯洁和充满爱意的。
Don’t turn me away so easily, \PN. I know I’m a lot.
不要这么轻易地拒绝我，\PN，我知道我...
I come on strong. Well, the incandescence inside my heart leaches out through my body.
表现得过于强势了，将我心中的光辉透露出了太多。
I want you, and I want to be yours. I can’t hide it.
我想要你，我想成为你的人，我无法隐藏这份愿望。
Oh, love, how I’ve longed to hear you say it.
我多么渴望听到你这么说，这或许就是爱吧。
You’re beautiful when you smile, you know that? More gorgeous than an open sky. Deific in your grace.
你微笑时很美，你知道吗？比开阔的天空更美丽，你的优雅神圣不可侵犯。
But I don’t want you to rush into this. Take your time. We can move slowly.
但我不希望你过于匆忙，慢慢来，我们可以慢慢前进。
\PN, I don’t want to be your friend. I don’t know that I even want to be your lover.
\PN，我不想成为你的朋友，我不确定我是否想成为你的情人。
I want to be with you. I want you to be mine, forever. I want you to be my crescent moon to illuminate my starless skies.
我想和你在一起，我希望你永远属于我，我希望你能成为我的明月，照亮我这片没有星星的天空。
Here. Take this as a token of my boundless love.
拿着这个，作为我无尽爱意的象征。
To show you I’m honest, and that I only want the best for you. This is the true color of my love for you.
为了向你表明我忠诚的心，以及我对你的予取予求。这就是我对你的爱的颜色。
Let this gift saturate your soul. Let it dye you with my affections. Let it be the start of our eternal romance.
让这份礼物浸润你的灵魂，让它染上我对你的感情，让它成为我们永恒浪漫的开始。
You’re amazing. Everything I saw in Yezera, in the avatars, even in the myths and legends, are all in you. You’re radiant. I want to bask in that radiance.
你太棒了，我在叶泽拉、化身、甚至神话传说中看到的一切，都在你身上浮现，如此光辉璀璨，让我忍不住想沐浴在其中。
Think about it.
好好感受吧。
I’d love you more than anyone else ever could. Go and take care of your material affairs. Your badges and your tournament – all those trivial things.
我会比任何人都更爱你，去处理你那些世俗的事务吧，把徽章、比赛什么的都弄好。
And then find me. Somewhere... romantic.
然后来找我，在某个...浪漫的地方。
The top of a snowy mountain, overlooking the entire world. Beautiful. Stern and rugged and powerful. With an ancient soul.
在一座雪山的顶端，俯瞰整个世界，美丽、严肃、粗犷而强大，还拥有着古老的灵魂。
Just like you. Goodbye, \PN. I love you.
那一切就像你一样美好。再见，\PN，我爱你。
Forever.
永远不变。
Samorn's House
塞蒙家
"Attention: All Team Chasm Grunts"
"注意：所有裂隙队员"
"Team Chasm is no longer in operation, and activities here are to cease."
"裂隙队已正式解散，这里的活动也将停止。"
"Until further notice, this base is now part owned by the scholars of Novo College."
"在另行通知之前，这个基地由望新学院暂时管理。"
"Your admins thank you for your dedication."
"感谢您的付出与奉献。"
You'd think that Samorn, the gym leader down there, would have issues getting around in her wheelchair.
你觉得塞蒙，也就是下面那个道馆的馆主，坐着轮椅会不会行动不便？
Especially in difficult terrain like this.
尤其是在需要爬坡下坡的地形。
At first I thought she'd use her dragons to help her down, but apparently that's too awkward.
起初我以为她会用自身的龙属性精灵来帮她，但那也显得太笨了。
Instead she just has her Runerigus do the heavy lifting. It isn't part of her team, so it gets to relax at home the rest of the day, too.
其实她一直用一只迭失板来做各种重活，而这只精灵并不在她的常规出战列表里。
Hello. My Druddigon and I handle trips down to Samorn's gym.
你好，我和我的赤面龙，负责在这里帮助需要下去的人。
Stay away from the ledge and we won't have any problems.
这点高低差对我来说就是小问题。
Careful!
小心点！
If you've got a scheduled visit, I'm authorized to help you get down the ledge.
如果你想前往道馆，我可以带你从这里下去。
...
...
You look like a Trainer.
你看起来是个训练师对吧？
*sigh*
*嗤笑*
You're here too early.
但你来的太早了。
Samorn only takes the strongest of challengers, and you aren't strong enough yet.
塞蒙只接待最强大的挑战者，显然你还不够格。
Go get all of the other badges first. Then you might be strong enough.
先把其他徽章都拿到手，然后才有这个资格。
My Druddigon and I handle trips down to Samorn's gym.
我和我的赤面龙，负责在这里帮助想挑战道馆的人。
That service is for civilians, however.
不过这项服务是提供给平民的。
Trainers like you should know their place.
向你这样的训练师应该有自身的办法才对。
Don't even think about challenging the Dreadnaught until you've acquired every other Makyan badge.
在你集齐其他所有马凯亚徽章之前，想都别想挑战“无畏”。
Oh, hello. I see you have some climbing gear.
嘿，你好，我看到你有一些攀岩设备。
I suppose that means you could go down to the gym on your own power.
也就是说你可以自行前往道馆了。
I wouldn't recommend it. You still have a lot of growth to do.
但我不建议你现在挑战，你还有很多其他事可以做。
Yes! You are the proper level of strength to challenge the Dreadnaught.
哈哈，你的实力已经足够了。
I'm sure she will be pleased to battle you.
我相信她会很高兴与你交手的。
You've bested the Dreadnaught! Well fought.
你打败了无畏的塞蒙，很好！
My congratulations to you and your Pokemon.
恭喜你和你的精灵们。
The 8th gym already. I can't believe how time flies.
已经是第8个道馆了，真不敢相信时间过得那么快。
I've been enjoying this. I really and truly hope that you have, too.
我一直在享受这个过程，希望你也如此。
Nothing like the search for perfection to motivate you to try crazy things.
没有什么比追求完美，更能激励你去做疯狂的举动了。
Using species that are supposed to be extinct, for example.
例如，使用本已灭绝的物种。
I'm eager to try out this Arcanine, so hit me up post- haste!
我很想试试风速狗的实力，所以尽快来找我吧！
We could add to the history of this place by engaging in a struggle of training supremacy. You inclined?
我们要进行一场训练至上的对战吗？为这里的历史添上浓墨重彩的一比！
Understood.
明白了。
I'll be here until you wish to battle.
你准备好了再来找我吧。
When I win, I'm gonna shout something very quotable.
如果我赢了，我一定得喊几句名言警句。
Rock doggy.... no....
诶呀啊啊...不...
Heh, now I know how the grunts felt when Yezera whipped their butts.
呵呵，现在我好像明白叶泽拉在面对那些士兵时的感受了。
Leave me to the task of reviving my battlers.
让我先复活我的战士吧。
Vanya breathes out heavily.
凡雅重重地出了口气。
So, this is it. The very last badge. After this comes the championship, you know.
就是它了，最后一枚徽章，之后就是锦标赛了。
Even more than usual, I can't afford to mess this one up.
比起往常，这次更不能出错。
Thank you for your help. Now it's just up to me to do what I've trained to do.
感谢你一直以来的帮助，现在轮到我去挑战了。
Team Chasm HQ Gym
裂隙队总部道馆
Leader: Samorn
馆主：塞蒙
History and motion.
历史与行动。
Hey, kiddo. Knew you’d show up sooner or later. You took to training like a Wooper to water, didn’t you?
呵，小鬼，我就知道你会来，你应该跟乌波一样适应环境了对吧？
Had to work myself to the bone to get here before you and, guess what? Gym leader’s out again.
为了在你之前赶到这里，我不得不拼命往这边赶，你猜怎么着？馆主又不在。
You waiting for me to throw a Poké Ball at you?
你在等我往你身上扔球吗？
I’m not gonna. Not about to bruise my team just before challenging the gym.
我才不会做这种蠢事，在挑战道馆之前，我可不想减小队伍的战斗力。
Yes, \PN. I snuck down here and put a sign on the door saying it’s closed after beating the gym, just to trick you.
你猜对了，\PN，我悄悄溜到这里，在道馆门上放了个关门的牌子，就是为了骗你。
It’s a flawless plan, really.
这真是个蠢到掉渣的计划。
Not if you schedule in advance.
除非你提前预约。
Or that’s what I’d like to say – professionalism isn’t in this region’s blood.
或者我这么说吧...这个地区的人都不怎么敬业。
Don’t even get me STARTED on that man in the bayou. Insufferable.
总之，别再谈这个地区的讨厌鬼了。
In any case, Samorn’s out.
现在的情况就是塞蒙不在。
Sign on the door says she’s dealing with some ruckus over at the dig site. You coming?
门上的牌子说她正在处理挖掘现场的骚乱，你要一起去看看？
That’s what I thought. Let’s go.
这就是我希望的答案，走吧。
Oh, you want to be contrary, do you? Fine. Stay here and wait.
哦，你不想去是吗？好吧，那你就留在这等着吧。
The dig site. West of town.
挖掘现场就在这里西边。
I swear, sometimes you’re more thick-skulled than a Rampardos. Let’s go perform some heroics, shall we?
虽说有时候你比战锤龙还拗，但去做些英勇的事也没什么不好的，对吧？
The railway here used to be pretty nice, but it got destroyed when that girl took Team Chasm down.
以前这里的铁路相当漂亮，但从那个女孩打倒了裂隙队后，它就被破坏了。
No one's ever really gotten to repairing the whole thing, too much hassle for too little gain.
然后就没人愿意修复它了，因为太麻烦，收益又小。
Most of the dirt and heavy equipment are already where they need to be.
明明大部分的泥土和重型设备已经准备好了。
Closed while Samorn participates in the Makya Championship Tournament.
马凯亚锦标赛期间闭馆。
Hey, trying to get Samorn's badge as well? I've tried, but I've had no luck so far.
你也想获得塞蒙的徽章？我之前试过，但一直没成功。
I was prepped for countering a Sandstorm strategy, based on the legends I heard.
我明明已经根据收集到的情报，做好了应对沙暴队的准备。
But she apparently hasn't used that strategy in forever, despite how well suited to it some of her Pokemon are.
但是她还有其他的战斗策略，即便她的精灵很适合沙暴天气。
Maybe it's a "hiding your true power level" thing? I just don't get it...
或许这也是一种“隐藏真实实力”的方法？
You got the 8th badge? Damn, that means I gotta get myself one.
你得到了第8个徽章了？看来我也得找时间去拿1个了。
I want to at least make it to the Championship this year.
今年起码去锦标赛露个脸。
Um, hi?
呃...你好？
You're acting different.
你咋了？
Same to you.
我觉得你也是
You're a creep.
你好奇怪...
Wait, what?
你在说什么？
Good for her.
她很棒
You're into Yezera?
你喜欢叶泽拉？
Eyes only for me?
跟我有关系？
Um.
......
Hell no.
不可能
I feel the same way.
我觉得可以
Can we be friends?
成为朋友？
Maybe later.
等会儿
Sure, let's go.
来吧
You kidding me?
你在开玩笑？
Happens a lot.
这种事经常发生
Of course.
当然
Nah.
不要
Where?
在哪里？
[Map215]
[Map216]
Phione! \PN! What just happened here?
霏欧纳！\PN！这是怎么回事？
What? They can do that? Like, Phione BECAME an avatar? That’s insane!
什么...他们竟然能...把霏欧纳变成1个化身？
I’ve been trying to find Phione for hours now!
我和它几小时前...分开了，我一直在找它！
And then when I finally do it’s you fighting it as a fricking avatar?
但是...终于找到的时候，你正在跟变成化身的它战斗？
Yeah! What’d you do? I mean – I’m not blaming you, but what happened here?
这...为什么？我...我不是怪你，但是...这到底都发生了什么？
OK, sorry, I get it. You’re confused too.
抱歉...我知道你也很困惑...
Phione was acting strange – standoffish, kinda hostile.
前不久，霏欧纳突然变得好奇怪...它冷漠，还带着浓浓的敌意。
Then it lashed out at me and bolted. I’ve been hunting it since then.
然后它对我发动了攻击，然后就逃走了，我从那时起就一直在找它。
It looks OK now… you couldn’t’ve KO’d it any gentler?
现在...应该没事吧...你不能...轻轻地...打倒它吗？
Ah, it’s alright. No major scrapes or bruises – it’ll be fine. Just need to do some first aid…
啊，没事的...没有很严重的伤势...它会没事的，只需要治疗一下...
I get that, but c’mon.
我知道，但是...
It’s obviously – I don’t know, possessed or something. Messed up in the head.
我..我不知道..它应该是被什么占据了...导致...头脑混乱什么的。
It’s not too bruised. Just need to do some first aid…
没有很严重的伤势...它会没事的，只需要治疗一下...
Well… yeah. Sure. It’s an avatar.
啊...也对，毕竟...现在它是1个化身。
Don’t pull your punches. Well, no harm no foul. Just need to do some first aid…
你没有理由手下留情...还好，没有很严重的伤势...它会没事的，只需要治疗一下...
Insane. Complete insanity. It attacked me, turned into an avatar, attacked you…
这到底是怎么了？为什么，它会攻击我？然后还变成化身，攻击你...
What would’ve happened if you hadn’t beaten it?
如果你没有打败它又会发生什么...
Ah, no use thinking about it. I just… I feel terrible. I feel just awful, because honestly I’m relieved.
啊...想那些也没用...我只是...一时...我感到很糟糕，但这样也好。
Because if it wasn’t an avatar, then it just left. It just left me. It hated me.
如果它没有变成化身，就选择攻击我，离开我...
Yeah. Because at least it didn’t really hate me. It didn’t leave me.
也就是说，它并没有恨我，并没有因为讨厌我才离开。
It’s hard. I was so afraid that it’d just left me that anything else is, like, a breath of fresh air.
我好怕它会离开我...
Well… we’ll see. Hopefully it’ll wake up and this’ll all be a distant memory.
还好...它会醒来的，这一切都会过去的。
Something we can laugh about, yeah?
将来或许还会成为笑谈，对吧？
And… damn, I keep bringing you into this?
而且...我总是把你牵扯进来...
You gotta bail me outta everything. Well, thanks.
谢谢你做的一切，谢谢。
Here. I’ve had these for a while, but I don’t really need them now. For one reason or another.
这个给你了，出于某种原因...我已经不再需要它们了。
Doesn’t really make us even, but thanks.
当然这不足以报答你的恩情，权当我微不足道的谢意吧。
I need to get Phione somewhere safer, but I’ll see you. Thanks for everything.
现在我得带着霏欧纳去安全的地方了，我们还会再见的。
Have you seen my new avatar defense technique? Pokésand, go!
要见识一下我抵御化身的新招数吗？精灵之沙，出击！
Hmm, back to the drawing board on this one.
嗯，看来还需要重新设计。
The technique is for avatars, not Trainers. I can't expect it to work perfectly here.
这个技巧是针对化身的，不是针对训练师的。我不指望它在对战中也能完美发挥。
Huh? Weather wars? What's that?
啥？天气战争？那是什么？
North: Cave of Hatching
北：启明之窟
East: Frostflow Farms
东：风霜农场
Hey! It's uh... the guy you saw near the Regice Chamber.
哦，你是...我在雷吉秘室看到的那个人。
I think I got a decent understanding of what's happened to me.
我或许多多少少对自身身上发生的事情有些了解。
Whatever I was, it kept me separated from the world for a while. A lot has changed.
无论我到底是谁，它都让我暂时与世界隔绝了，这让很多事情都发生了变化。
Team Chasm is done. People have moved on, though not totally.
裂隙队已经走到了终点，人们应当向前看了，尽管很多人不这么想。
Rangers got me set up good. I have a lot of old friends that thought I was dead. They were more than happy to help me when I showed up.
护林员们把我安置得很好，很多老朋友都以为我死了，但我出现时，大家都愿意帮助我。
In a way, Hoopa really did help me. Got to skip out on some of the rough parts of Team Chasm breaking up, and I'm taken care of.
不得不说，胡帕在某些方面帮了我，我躲过了裂隙队解散时的一些麻烦，还得到了不错的照顾。
I'm... ok. In a weird way. But that's life for ya, huh? It's all weird, and then it isn't. And you're ok.
我的生活方式很奇怪？但这就是生活，尽管奇怪，只要过得好就可以了。
That's life. Weird, but you're ok.
这就是生活，奇怪，但又合适。
That's a nice feeling, you know?
你不觉得这种感觉很好吗？
How are you... here? This isn't even the right map... I don't actually exist. Sort of, at least... Please... don't cheat when we fight...
你怎么......在这里？这甚至不是正确的地图......我并不真正存在。至少某种程度上......请......别在对战时作弊......
Sheeeeeeesh, let's get a looksie at this this little Trainer now!
哦哦哦，快看这个小训练师！
Well butter my butt and call me a biscuit, this here Trainer's got us slapped silly!
好吧，你可以随便给我取外号，竟然被这样打败了！
What a howdown from our Trainer friend here. Bet they got one o' those fancy candy thingamajigs.
我们的训练师朋友真会说话，想必一定吃了不少糖吧。
Stop that
别这样。
A Pokemon world, and within every battle, a world of struggle.
奋斗与竞争，在精灵的一生，多少败与成。
How much can I fit, into a haiku format? I'm running out of...
俳句的格式的确很严格，能塞的东西有限...
A loud crashing lake, Chatot chirp in the distance, they sing united.
湖畔水声漾，与聒噪鸟的清嗓，一曲共颂唱。
I write, erase, rewrite. Erase again, and then, my Ditto changes.
一字一音替，不知不觉日偏西，百变怪作笔。
You can barely make out the outline of a cave entrance behind the waterfall.
勉强可以透过瀑布，看到后面洞口的轮廓。
My Pokemon love the trees and grass. They also love battling!
我的精灵们喜欢树木和草丛，也很喜欢战斗！
What's that, my Pokemon? You want to go to the pub?
我的精灵这是...想去酒吧？
I have no choice, I must listen to them. Bye bye!
我只能听它们的了，再见！
Good battling! You should fight my brother, too. He's all the way at the end of the river.
打得不错，或许你有兴趣跟我哥也来一场，他就在这条河的尽头。
Heya, Trainer!
嗨，训练师
I heard that a Champion was going to be here, but I coulnd't find them.
我听说有个冠军要来这里，但我找不到人。
I even brought a Krabby to throw at them and everything! I stole it from a Ranger when he wasn't looking.
我甚至还趁护林员不注意，偷了只大钳蟹想扔向他！
If I can't throw it at someone important, I'll sell it to get some ice cream!
如果见不到冠军的话，那就把它卖了去买冰淇淋吧！
$5000! That'll get me ice cream for a week!
5000金钱！我就可以连续吃一周冰淇淋了！
You're lucky you're a nobody, otherwise I'd throw it at you.
你应该庆幸自身没什么名气，不然我就要用大钳蟹扔你了。
Done deal Trainer!
交易完成，训练师
\PN hands over $5000 in exchange.
\PN将5000金钱交给对方。
Maybe I'll get chocolate today...
要不还是去买巧克力吧...
Haha, you're poor! That's really funny!
哈哈，穷鬼，嘿嘿！
Well golly me we got a cheater! Looks like they did a little bit of hackerooni.
我们遇到作弊高手了！他绝对用了什么黑客技术。
Well I ain't never seen a scrap like that since before my pa started herding Tauros with his bare hands.
除了我那个徒手跟肯泰罗较劲的老爸，我已经很久没见过这种废物了。
Real shame what happened to his favorite knee.
真是耻辱啊！
Welp, I'll have to abandon my Cave of Hatching visit...
看来我不得不放弃前往启明之窟的旅程了...
The entrance is blocked, and I stupidly didn't bring any climbing gear.
入口被堵住了，我也没带什么登山装备。
If I did, I could have climbed around, but alas.
不然我就能直接爬过去了。
All I wanted was to experience the legend...
我只是想去体验下传说中的...
Take this item, I'm clearly not worthy of it...
把这个拿走吧，我不配...
...
...
You're cheating, right?
你在作弊！
I'm just here to play my guitar. No idea who the other guy is...
我只是来弹吉他的，根本不认识那个人...
It was an avatar.
这是个化身。
You're here?
你也在啊？
You're asking me?
你问我我问谁？
Sorry.
抱歉。
It was attacking me.
它也会攻击我。
Could've. Didn't.
可以但我不这么打算。
Why?
为什么？
That it was possessed?
你觉得它被附身了？
Don't beat yourself up.
不要自责。
No thanks.
不用了，谢谢。
I'll take it.
我会收下它。
[Map217]
Looks like the Trainer ahead is moving to block you from going any further.
前方的训练师显然不会允许你通过。
Do you want to approach them? It looks like a tough fight.
要贸然靠近他们吗？这将是一场恶战。
I knew you would arrive, should I only wait.
我就知道你会来这里。
Excuse the charade – I would prefer my identity remain enshrouded in mystery for now.
至于这份伪装，请别在意，目前我们还得隐藏身份。
All that you are required to understand is who I serve – Yezera. Under her profound guidance, we have achieved our goals.
你只需要知道我们为叶泽拉工作，并在她的指导下，一步步完成我们的目标。
The titans have served their purpose. I come then with a simple inquiry: will you not listen to my reasoning?
这次行动已经结束了，而我等在这里只是为了问一句，你愿不愿意听一下我们的理由。
Thank you. Our goal is naught less than a complete reordering of the world.
谢谢，我们的目标，不仅仅是为了重构这个世界。
My comrades have their own motives, but mine is simple.
每个人都有自身的动机，而我的愿望很简单。
The world at present is mercurial and deceptive. Human culture and technology serves as naught but a veil disguising ultimate truth.
目前的世界充满了欺骗与变化，人类的技术与文化，都在掩盖本应被大家知晓的真相。
Only the realm of ancient myth, tended by gods, untouched by humans, might let us perceive it.
只有古老神话的领域，在神灵守护中，未曾被人类触及，才得以让我们触碰到真实。
Do you not agree?
你觉得呢？
How disappointing, to dismiss it outright.
你竟然直接否定了这一切。
If you have no eye for truth, then we have nothing else to speak of.
既然你没有看清一切的眼光，那也就没什么可说的了。
Forgive me this act of passion, but I expect a titan’s wrath may settle my raging heart.
请原谅我的情绪波动，但巨人的愤怒将会抚平这一切。
Regirock, heed my command.
雷吉洛克，听我号令。
To the contrary: it has adamant support, if only one ruminates on the matter.
只要人们肯深入思考，就会发现这一切是对的。
Such wavering faith is nigh-useless for my purposes, alas. We require unflinching devotion.
但这种满是动摇的信仰对我的目的没有任何作用，我们需要更加坚定的信念。
*sigh* I would be forsaking my duty if I did not stall you at the least. Prepare yourself.
*轻笑声*为了履行我的职责，起码要拖延你前进的进程。做好准备吧！
I should encourage you to do so. Judge the weight of the world that is against the world that could be.
我很高兴你愿意这样做，去评估世界的重量，对比真实与虚伪。
Alas, I know you will not ruminate idly upon it. You are a threat. That is intolerable to us.
但我不会就这样等着，现在的你仍是威胁，我们无法容忍的威胁。
This shall be no decisive victory of mine, but I cannot let you pass unhindered.
我知道想要赢你并不容易，但也不能让你轻松通过这里。
…I should very much like to believe you.
...我也很希望能相信你。
If you speak truth, then I bid you repeat your convictions to Yezera herself next you meet.
如果你真是这样想的，那下次见到叶泽拉时，请重复你刚才的想法。
She can see the machinations of your heart more clearly than I. Until then, you remain a trainer, as do I.
她比我更擅长看清别人内心的阴谋，但现在我们仍然是对手。
My enemy I smite, my ally I train. To either, en garde.
而对手，就是要打倒的。
If you will not listen to my entreaties, then you are beyond salvation.
连最基本的倾听都不愿意，也就代表你已经无药可救了。
Alas. Perhaps a titan’s fury will enlighten you to the clarity of the ancients.
唉，或许巨人的怒火，能让你清晰地认识到这一切。
G’afternoon. Took your sweet time showing your face ‘round these parts, didn’t ya?
下午好，没想到你现在才赶到这里。
Listen, I ain’t ‘bout to preach to ya. Just want to make some things clear ‘fore we fight.
首先，我并不是想说教，只是希望能在战斗前澄清一些事情。
‘Cause we’re gonna fight. Ain’t no other way to it.
虽然无论如何都得打这一架...
Thank you kindly. I ain’t real interested in this cloak- and-dagger charade.
非常感谢，其实...我并不喜欢这种装扮...
I’m with Yezera, always.
我只是一直在帮叶泽拉做事。
Listen, I’m only gonna say this once: you oughta hear her out.
注意，我只说1次：你应该去听听她的意见。
Don’t care if you agree with her. Just hear her out.
无论你是否认可她的想法，只是去听听，应该不难吧。
And if you hurt her, I’ll make you wish Mavis stopped after Zain. We clear?
但是如果你伤害到她，我会让你输给赞恩的，明白了吗？
Cocky li’l brat, ain’t ya? Tsk.
真是个自大的家伙。
What’s so damn infuriating ‘bout you is I ain’t just able to whip your sorry hide into submission. Too good.
然而让我不爽的是，我没办法轻松打倒你，你的确有些实力。
How ‘bout I try anyhow? Titan’s gotta be good for somethin’, right?
所以就来试试吧，看看巨人拥有怎样的力量。
Good. I ain’t ‘bout ta repeat myself.
好的，我不想重复自身的话。
Now, I came here with a job to do, and I’m a reliable sort.
现在，作为1个可靠的队友，我还是得完成自身的任务。
Sorry, kid. You’re a mite too fast. Gotta slow you down. Regirock, lead us off, will ya darlin’?
抱歉了，孩子。你的进度太快了，我得让你放慢一些脚步。上吧，雷吉洛克！
Hah. Take it from someone who knows, kid: you ain’t even scratched the surface.
哈，我只能以我的经验告诉你，你甚至连表面都还未触及到。
I can make you plenty more miserable if I set my mind to it.
只要我想，我还能继续拖你的时间。
But, cheer up, kid. I’m ‘bout to give ya what you always want: a good fight. Facing a Regi oughta cheer ya up. Heh.
不过，你应该想要一场优质的对局吧？面对雷吉洛克，或许能让你振奋起来。
Nah, I ain’t about to trust that. Ya don’t know jack about me and Yezera.
哼，我才不信这句话！你根本不了解我和叶泽拉的事。
Bickering old married couple, that’s what we are.
我们已经是经常拌嘴的老夫妻了。
Want to show me you’re with us? Tell it to Yezera.
如果要证明你的想法，那就把这些想法告诉她吧！
For now, I ain’t too keen on letting you off easy. Sorry. Beating folks into the dirt is my job, after all.
但现在，我不会让你轻易脱身的，将你打得落花流水就是我的工作。
Ah, well. Guess no matter how hard I try, old habits die hard.
呵，好吧，不管怎么努力，老习惯还是不肯消停啊。
Speaking of dying hard – lay down and quit moving, will ya?
说到这里...现在得请你消停一下了。
Hah. They ain’t never been happy with my way of goin’ about covert ops.
哈哈，他们也觉得我不擅长秘密行动。
Too rough ‘nd tumble. I ain’t built for cloak-and-dagger.
我行事太过直白粗暴。
So, let me tell you straight: you listen to Yezera. You hear her out. And don’t you dare hurt her.
所以，我就直白地告诉你了：去听取叶泽拉的意见，倾听她的想法，不许伤害她。
All I ask. And, uh, I wasn’t just sent here to chit-chat. You ready?
这就是我唯一的要求。当然我也不是来找你闲聊的，现在你准备好了吗？
Hey. Fancy meeting you in a place like this.
嘿，在这里相遇真是巧啊。
Oh, don’t look so angry – Regirock and I are here to fight you, but we’ll get to that.
哦，别动火啊，我和雷吉洛克就是为了打败你而来的，但我们会先说清楚状况。
I know you’re more than a pretty face. You’re smart. Care to hear me out?
我知道你不仅有好看的面容，还有着聪慧的大脑，所以能听我说完吗？
Aww. I knew I had a good feeling about you.
啊，我就知道你是个好人。
How do I explain it… well, I hate to use the word, but modern society is degenerate.
我该怎么解释呢...嗯...我不想用这个词，但现代社会的的确确是堕落的。
We’re distant from the perfect moment of creation. We’ve kind of taken over the world.
我们远离了神创造的完美世界，对一切掌握得过多了。
No respect for our elders – the primordial Pokémon that created the universe.
我们并没有给予创造宇宙的精灵足够的尊重。
Yezera’s going to reset this world back to its origins. And then humanity will be in the bosom of Arceus once more.
叶泽拉将会把一切回溯到起源，届时人类将再次回到阿尔宙斯的怀抱。
Don’t call me insane. Although I’m sure this arrogant, faithless civilization would use that term.
不许用这个词来称呼我，这是傲慢又没有信仰的文明才会用的堕落词汇！
I’m merely devout, and devotion means making sacrifices. For example: you.
我只是虔诚而已，虔诚即意味着做出牺牲。就好比：你。
I really do like you, but… we all have to sacrifice sometimes.
我真的很喜欢你，但是...牺牲是绝对不可避免的。
Godlike Pokémon are now treated as not much more than beasts of burden.
那些神明一般的精灵现在都被看作是牲畜一般。
Avatars are destroyed at will because they’re “threats to humans.”
化身被肆意地破坏，就因为它们是“对人类的威胁”。
The world has lost all respect, the divine essence from creation diluted and destroyed.
这个世界已经毫无尊重可言，神圣的本质被稀释、破坏。
And since you seem to be no different, I can take some joy in this fight.
既然你也没什么不同，那就在这场战斗中获得一些乐趣吧。
Arceus created the world. It is pure, and perfect, and resetting the world back to its original form will let us be pure and perfect too.
阿尔宙斯创造了这个世界，它是最纯净、最完美的，而重置后的我们也会变得纯净和完美。
I’d like to see myself blessed by the grace of our creator.
我想要得到神的恩典与祝福。
I’d like to see you that way, too.
我希望你也能得到这些。
In time.
时间差不多了。
For now, I’ve been ordered to slow you down. Shall we dance?
我接到的命令是拖延你的时间，那么现在，我们开始跳舞吧？
Good. I knew I saw something in you.
很好，我知道你身上迸发出了什么。
Some spark of faith. I’m a… very good judge of character.
那是一些信仰的火花，而我是1个...善于识人的人。
I’d love to just talk with you for a while, but I was explicitly instructed to stop you. So we’ll fight. Don’t take it personally.
我很想和你多聊一会儿，但我的任务是要阻止你，所以我们还是要对决，这跟我个人的情感无关。
Oh. Was I too forward?
哦，我太直接了吗？
My emotions tend to get the better of me. I’m almost heartbroken.
我总是会被自身的情绪控制，我现在心都要碎了。
Well, I suppose I am a stranger.
也对，我现在是个陌生人。
Fortunately, I’ve been sent to slow you down, so I have a convenient vent for all these feelings of rejection.
好在我的任务就是来拖延你，眼前正好有1个方便的出气口，释放掉这些被拒绝的痛苦。
Hello, friend.
你好，朋友。
Business before pleasure: I have been sent to slow your progress.
我一直都是直来直往，我是来拖延你的进程的。
To that end, I am accompanied by a titan.
为此，我还带了1个巨人。
Before we attend to that, however, may I interest you in a short, frank discussion?
然而，在我们处理这个问题之前，可以先向你介绍一下我们的立场吗？
I would rather like to try to convince you of the legitimacy of our position.
我想试着说明我们的立场是正确的。
Thank you for your time.
感谢你的时间。
Yezera’s goal is to recreate the conditions of the world shortly following its creation.
叶泽拉的目标是重现世界诞生后不久的样子。
Modern science has attained almost complete understanding and mastery over the world – the modern world.
现代科学已经几乎完全理解和掌握了现在的这个世界。
It cannot, however, understand the past. By reverting existence, we may study the universe from its conception and obtain universal knowledge.
但是，却无法理解过去。通过回到过去，我们就可以研究宇宙开始的概念，并获得宝贵的知识。
This is the only way to do so.
这是唯一的方法。
Without the reversion, humanity will never attain complete understanding of the universe. It is worth all prices.
如果不这么做，人类将永远无法理解宇宙，这些代价是值得的。
Now our time for conversation is up, however. Regirock, please do the honors.
现在，交流时间结束，雷吉洛克，开始行动。
All persons who attempt to advance civilization should care.
所有试图让文明得以推进的人都应该关心。
Universal knowledge is a prerequisite for an all- powerful society.
知识普及是使文明进入新时代的先决条件。
That is my goal. That is the goal of all science: to know, and to apply that knowledge.
这是我的目标，也是所有科学发展的目标：理解，并运用那些知识。
Your ignorance implies discussion will get us nowhere. Let us dispense with such, then.
你的无知也就代表着，我们的讨论不会有任何进展，那么就没有继续下去的必要了。
Knowledge will be retained into the new primordial era.
知识将被保留到新的原始时代。
We can rebuild at least small enclaves of humanity.
我们可以重建人类的小聚落。
From there our analysis and conquest will begin: a new society with absolute knowledge.
并以此为基准开始分析与征服，并发展为1个拥有绝对知识的新社会。
And, stemming from this absolute knowledge, absolute power.
同时，还会因为绝对的知识，拥有绝对的力量。
Consider it. In the mean time, there is the business I mentioned earlier. Excuse me.
考虑一下吧，与此同时，我也该执行接到的任务了。
I am glad you have the wisdom to agree. If you should wish to support us in our endeavors, I will be happy to have you.
我很高兴你拥有这份智慧，如果你愿意支持我们的事业，我很高兴能有你的加入。
We will fight for a more enlightened era. For now, however, I must slow you. Business is business. Let us commence.
我们将为1个更开明的时代而战，但现在，我必须阻止你。任务如此，让我们开始吧。
I find this highly unfortunate. You will be left behind by progress.
这并不是1个正确的选择，你将被进步抛在脑后。
If you would prefer to retain your ignorance, however, I cannot help you.
然而，既然你自愿保持无知，那我也无能为力。
Prepare yourself. Regirock, if you would.
准备好了吗？雷吉洛克，出击。
Oh. Hey.
嗨，你好。
Yeah, so, I knew you’d be here. Gym challenger, and, uh, all that.
哈哈，我知道你会来这里，道馆的挑战者...等下！
…Welp. This is awkward.
...唔，有点尴尬。
How do I say this… you interested in hearing us out?
我该怎么说呢...你有兴趣听听我们的想法吗？
We’ve kinda got the upper hand, but, y’know, don’t really wanna fight you. Whaddya say?
我们现在可是占上风了，但是...你应该明白，我们不想与你敌对，你觉得呢？
Oh. That’s good. Great. Honestly didn’t expect that.
哦，那太好了！真的没想到...
Well, I just figure we’ve done a lot of ordering Pokémon around.
我只是觉得我们不应该将那么多命令强加给精灵。
Maybe it’s time to even up the footing a bit, y’know?
也许是时候让我们站在同样的地位上了，大概...
We can all kinda make up for whatever we did wrong.
我们有机会弥补以前所犯的错误。
The others have their reasons, but, uh, this is mine. Make a world where we can be forgiven. You get it?
其他人有他们自身的理由，但...呃...这是我的理由。创造1个我们可以被原谅的世界，你能理解我的意思吗？
Well – fine. You know what? Fine.
好吧...你有自身的想法。
I don’t need your permission, and we certainly don’t need your help. Regirock. Do ‘em in.
当然，我不需要你的认可，也不需要你的帮助，雷吉洛克，干掉他。
…You so sure? Takes a lot of pushing to train a team that strong in so little time.
...你确定？这么短的时间内训练出这么多强大的精灵，这得需要多大的压力啊！
But, yeah, no, I get it. Why would you help us?
但是，啊...我明白了，你并没有帮助我们的理由。
Rich brat. Maybe we can beat some responsibility into you.
毕竟你是个富家子弟，你应该承担起更多责任。
Uh. Don’t really know how to break it to you. You… don’t have time.
嗯，我不知道该怎么说...你...没有思考的时间了。
For one, we’ve already just about won. For two – think fast!
首先，我们已经快成功了，其次...我还有自身的任务。
Regirock, sweep ‘em off their feet!
雷吉洛克，把他解决掉吧！
Oh. Didn’t, uh, really expect that.
哦，没想到会这样。
Figured you were kind of a stuck-up brat. No offense.
我本以为你就是个自大的富家子弟...抱歉，请不要介意。
Well, good. Maybe we’ll be side by side one day, yeah?
好吧，也许有一天，我们会并肩作战，对吧？
But, uh, for now… I’m supposed to fight you.
但是，现在...我应该和你战斗。
So, uh, sorry – ah, what am I saying, we live for this. Ready up.
所以，抱歉...啊，我在说什么，都到这一步了...准备好了吗？
Yeah, I guess that tracks.
哈，我觉得也会是这样。
Fine. That’s… it’s fine.
好吧，没关系。
I came here to beat the crap out of you anyways.
我来这里就是为了揍你一顿的。
Odds are Regirock isn’t gonna stick around much longer, so let’s make it count. Try your best, eh?
雷吉洛克很快就要离开了，所以我要尽可能地利用好它。
…Hey.
嘿。
Tsk tsk tsk. I’m not gonna lie to you: I’ve been trying to plan this conversation in my head for the past hour.
呃...这个...我不会骗你：我已经在脑海中将这次谈话了预演1个小时了。
But, um, you kinda interrupted me. So can I just say what I want to tell you?
但是，嗯...思路断了...对，我能说一些我想告诉你的东西吗？
Welp. Listen, uh, Makya’s kinda in a weird place right now.
嗯...差不多...呃...马凯亚现在的情况很糟糕。
Team Chasm ran roughshod over this whole region and then kinda just… got away with it?
之前裂隙队在这里到处肆虐，然后就这样...撂挑子走了？
So, uh, yeah, if you ever wanted proof that humans can’t get even the most black-and-white justice right, there you are.
所以，这就是人类甚至连正确分辨是非善恶都做不到的最直接的证据。
Would’ve been simple to fix that little screw-up. But they didn’t.
本来很容易就能处理这些问题的，但他们没有这样做。
So we’re taking the power away from humans, and putting it in the hands of Pokémon.
所以我们要把权力从人类手中夺走，交到精灵手中。
Is it? Is it!
啊？这就是答案吗？
Am I insane for wanting some damn PUNISHMENT in this world?!
我就是希望他们得到应有的正义审判，是我的问题吗？
Well, guess what. If people won’t give me it, I’ll MAKE it.
行，无所谓了，既然大家不愿这么做，那我就自身去审判。
And I’ve got just the tool!
而我有很好的帮手！
It is simple, you – you idiot!
这明明很简单，你...你个白痴！
I can track down every ex-Chasm criminal and haul them up to the courts myself if I have to!
只要想这么办，我可以把每个裂隙队成员，亲自拖到法庭上受审。
They just won’t do anything if I did! So I have to do things personally, yeah?
但他们什么都没有做！所以我必须亲自去做这一切！
Sorry. Nothing… personal.
抱歉，这不是个人恩怨。
Yes!
没错！
They’re noble and pure and – and – and they’d never let me down!
他们高贵而纯洁...他们永远不会让我失望！
Unlike you! And everyone else around here!
不像你！还有你周围的每个人！
You want to see? C’mon. See what kind of justice Pokémon can give!
要见识一下吗？看看精灵能给出什么样的正义吧！
Oh. Ah-hah.
哦，啊哈。
Kinda got myself a bit worked up there… welp, no harm, no foul, yeah?
咳咳...有点激动...不过无伤大雅。
…Nah, that’s stupid.
...不，还是丢脸...
I’m not gonna waste this chance. I’ve got a Regi. You’re a prodigy. Let’s RUMBLE!
无论如何，我不会浪费这个机会，毕竟手里有1个巨人，我们来战吧！
Urgh, you make me so mad!
你让我很生气！
Nobody will frickin’ listen to me!
没人听我说话！
Fine.
好吧。
Y’know, fine, whatever.
好吧，随你便。
You get what everyone else I fight gets. What you deserve.
你会在我这里品尝到应有的失败！
Regirock – your watch is over. If you would go, then go.
雷吉洛克，你的任务结束了，你可以凭自身的意愿离开了。
So it returns to its resting place… no matter. It has done all I desired and more.
它现在回自身的安息之地了...但它已经超额完成了我的目的。
As for you, we shall meet again.
至于你，我们会再见面的。
Farewell, and do not pursue me. Fate and fate alone will dictate when we next speak.
再见了，不要跟过来。命运将会决定我们何时再相见。
Regirock’s damn well spent. Flighty li'l things never like to be outside their tombs too long.
雷吉洛克的任务结束了，这东西并不喜欢在墓穴外待太久。
Ah, well. Got what I came for anyhow.
反正我已经得到自身想要的了。
Let me tell you one last word of advice. You hurt Yez, I’ll find you. And it won’t just be for some play fight with animals.
最后再给你一句忠告，如果你伤害了叶泽拉，我会立即来收拾你。
G’evening, kid. I’ll see ya around. Make sure I don’t hafta hurt you too bad when I do, ‘kay?
晚安，孩子，我们还会再见的，当我们再见时，希望不是你让我怒不可遏的时候，好吗？
Au revoir, Regirock. Enjoy your entombment, I suppose.
再见了，雷吉洛克，享受你的安宁吧。
And as for you, that was an exciting fight. You’ve got my heart pounding.
这真是一场激动人心的战斗，你让我感到心跳加速了。
If you want to join us, come find Yezera. And if not, well, we’ll meet again. I’m looking forward to it already.
如果你想加入我们，就来找叶泽拉吧。即便不想，我们也会再相遇。
So long.
再见。
I surmise Regirock will now return to its tomb.
我想雷吉洛克应该回它的墓穴里面去了。
The titans are temperamental and ill-suited to existence outside their crypts. It is of no matter.
巨人们的情况很特别，不能长时间待在墓穴外，不过这不重要。
We have all but succeeded in our plans. This was a courtesy.
我们的计划已经成功了。
I will take my leave now. Thank you for your time.
我现在要走了，谢谢你的时间。
There it goes. Back to where it came from.
它走了，回它来的地方了。
Well, didn’t really expect to win anyways. Just wanted to slow you down, and, uh, I did.
嗯，我本来就没指望能赢，只是想拖延你的时间而已，并且也做到了。
So… bye. We’ll do this again sometime. I’m out.
那么...再见。希望我们有机会能再来1次。
*sigh* Buh-bye, Regirock. We don’t really, uh, need you anymore, I guess.
*叹气*再见了，瑞吉洛克，我想你可以回去了。
It was fun while it lasted… welp. Nothing lasts forever.
很有趣的一段经历...好吧，没有什么是永恒的。
Speaking of! Hopefully next time we talk it’ll be in a fair world!
希望下次，我们能在1个公平的世界里交谈！
If it isn’t, then, uh, I’ll give you a run for your money, ‘kay?
如果不是的话...那么...大概...我会让你付出代价的。
Toodles. And don’t you dare follow – I’m playing hard to get, so respect it. Hah!
再见了，不要试图跟着我...请尊重我不想暴露身份的意愿，哈！
For most of Sweetrock's history, we've relied on Clefable teleportation to get cargo from the factory to the docks.
多年以前的蜜岩港，都是靠皮皮的传送能力，把货物运到码头的。
We got these conveyor belts installed a few years back, so the cliffside isn't an issue anymore.
最近几年我们安装了传送带，为货物的运输工作提供便利。
We still have to rely on teleportation to get in and out of the harbor, though.
当然，皮皮们并没有因此失业，现在依然需要它们的传送能力。
It's the bottom of a conveyor belt. It'd be impossible to climb up.
这里是传送带的底部，爬不上去的。
The ocean to the east brings calming winds.
宁静的海风从东边吹来。
But why? We might explain it with ocean currents, or weather patterns.
但这究竟是为什么呢？根据气候和洋流我们能得知风向的成因。
But what makes the winds here calming? Of that, I am not so sure.
但究竟是什么原因，让这里的海风变得如此宁静呢？
More than a million years ago, a meteor struck this area of Makya, plowing through a large mountain to the west.
百万年前，有颗陨石从天而降，撞上了马凯亚的一座大山。
That large mountain became two smaller mountains, which we now know as Split Peaks.
巨大的冲击力将其一分为二，我们现在管那里叫嵌口峰。
The impact site itself would fill with water and become Sweetrock Harbor.
而被直接撞击的地方，则逐渐被海水灌满，并变成了今天的蜜岩港。
I really want to know who that was in the weird outfit.
我很好奇那些奇装异服的家伙到底是什么人。
Well, regardless, thanks for kicking them out of town.
总之，谢谢你帮我们把他从这里赶走了。
I'm a firefighter, so I'm used to dealing with issues...
我是一名消防员，我习惯地帮大家处理问题...
But "Cultist with a Regirock" is outside of my job description.
但“带着雷吉洛克的怪人”不在我的职责范围内。
I've been biking across the entire region over the past few months.
我花了几个月的时间，靠骑自行车走遍整个马凯亚。
Crossing the Split Peaks was by far the hardest part.
其中最难的部分就是嵌口峰。
The view from these cliffs, and the feeling that I've finally accomplished my goal, made it all worth it.
但当我从悬崖上眺望远方，将一切尽收眼底的那一刻，感觉一切努力都是值得的。

Sweetrock Candy is sent all over the world, but more than 30% ends up in the Galar Region.

I work at Sweetrock Candy factory, like many in town.
我像这里的很多人一样，在蜜岩糖果工厂工作。
That said, I rarely get to see Victoire, the manager and gym leader.
但是我很少见到老板，也就是道馆馆主薇克特尔。
I gotta rely on rumors to know what her team is like.
连我都只能通过传言来了解她所拥有的精灵。
Some of them are a bit hard to believe.
其中一些流言让人觉得离谱。
I heard some people saying that she uses a Rainstorm strategy.
比方有人曾经说，她用的是“暴雨策略”。
With Fairy and Steel-type Pokemon? How does she manage that?
可是妖精和钢属性的精灵，怎么用所谓的“暴雨策略”？
Huh, you really beat her, then?
哇，你打败她了？
You gotta tell me what she's like as a trainer.
你能告诉我她的水平怎么样吗？
My curiosity's grown too big!
我可太好奇了！

How goes your journey, young master?
少主，旅程还顺利吗？
I've purchased a Clefable teleportation license, and reserved this pier for our use.
我们已经购买了皮皮传送执照，并租借了码头的使用权。
We can travel to and from any of our usual locations.
这样我们就可以快速往返于一些地点了。
Where will we be heading?
我们要去哪儿？
Shh... don't give away my hiding spot!
嘘...不要暴露我的位置！
Is it... is it safe to come out now?
现在...已经安全了吗？

或许没有用我新酷炫的精灵打败第7个道馆那么有趣！
Which ones? You'll just have to battle me to find out!
是哪几只呢？你只有和我战斗才能知道！
I cannot convey to you just how much I want to battle. Heh. So, you up to doing so?
我都不知道该如何表达现在对战斗的渴望，所以，你准备好了吗？
Understood.
知道了。
I'll be here until you wish to battle.
你准备好了就来找我吧。
Rock 'Em, Torterra!
去吧，土台龟！
Damn, even these 'mons couldn't leave a dent in you.
该死，连这些精灵也没能对你造成一点伤害。
Think anyone in the lighthouse was watching our battle just now?

[Map218]
A cap of rock is holding back a geyser of boiling water.
一块巨石堵住了沸腾的水。
I was once considered a beauty, but the way of the water needed a disciple.
尽管我拥有着俊朗的相貌，但从水之道也需要虔诚的心。
I should dry off.
现在得擦干了。
Legends say if I stay here for fourty day and nights, my inner qi will strengthen tenfold.
只要在这里住上七七四十九天，我的内功就能增强10倍。
The way of the water is full of solice. Splash.
水之道，无常形，滋万物，润无声。
\PN! You made it. Took some effort to find this place but... man. It was worth it.
\PN，你来了！虽说费了不少功夫才来到这里，但...一切都值得。
What? My all-grown-up companion here? Yeah. It is.
什么？你说它？没错，只不过成年了而已。
Sorry. Well, not sorry. You didn’t have to come. But you did. And I’m glad you did.
抱歉...其实也没必要。你其实不用来这里的，但我很高兴你来了。
I think it’s soothing. I dunno, maybe I’m just a little more goth than I’d like to admit.
我倒是觉得这里很舒服，或许我比想象中更喜欢黑暗？
The waters here are special. Not just ice-cold and way too deep for me to be comfortable, but they’re saltwater, too.
这里的水很特别，又冷又深，而且还是咸水。
Ocean water, trapped down here. And for some reason... it makes Phione transform into Manaphy.
或许就是因为这些被困在这里面的海水，才让霏欧纳变成玛纳霏了吧。
I don’t know why, or how. I’m not that smart. But it does.
我不知道是怎么回事，我本来就没那么聪明，只知道事实就是如此。
I don’t even know if it’s really evolution. It’s – I don’t care. I don’t care how it works, or what it is scientifically.
我也不知道这该不该算进化，反正我不在乎在科学上该怎么解释。
It’s a Manaphy now. And I’m damn proud of it.
重要的是它没事了，而且现在是玛纳霏了。
Yeah! I mean, I think so, at least.
对，我就是这样想的。
I can’t believe it. A Pokémon of actual literal myth and legends, here beside me.
我简直不敢相信，自身能得到一只真正的传说中的精灵。
Oh. Uh, yeah, thanks.
嗯，谢谢。
Um. I didn’t really have a lot to do with it. Phione came down here, danced around in the water here, and then it just kinda... transformed.
其实我并没有参与太多，霏欧纳来到这里后，就开始在水中跳舞，然后就这样了。
Unbelievable. A Manaphy. I raised a Pokémon like this, all by myself.
我真的很难想象，自身竟然抚养了一只这样的精灵。
It’s a Pokémon from myth. Supposedly they live at the ocean floor and can befriend anything and anyone.
那时一种传说中的精灵，据说生活在海底，并且可以和任何事物交朋友。
They’re not half-bad in a scrap, either. Truly just... amazing. An absolutely incredible Pokémon.
而且它们也很擅长战斗，真是神奇到令人难以置信的精灵。
And it’s my best friend. It doesn’t hate me, or resent me, or fear me. It chose to be with me, of all people.
最重要的是，它是我最好的朋友，它不讨厌我，不恨我，不怕我。
It could’ve chosen anyone. It could’ve chosen you – you’re certainly a better trainer than I am.
它明明可以选择任何人，比如说你，你肯定比我更好...但它最终还是愿意跟我一起。
And, yeah, thank you, sincerely, for everything. You’re great. And you’ve really helped me. Thanks.
最后...真的...非常感谢你，这一路上你帮了我太多。
Hmm. Yeah, not good enough. Gonna need one last favor.
嗯...不过...我现在还有个请求。
I hope so! Not too many people have even seen one of these magical things. And fewer people have fought one.
我希望如此！另外...见过传说中精灵的人很少，跟它们战斗过的更是。
Oh, we’re on the same wavelength. You know what it means.
哦，我想我们想到一处去了。
That’s right. One last showdown. You and me. My new Manaphy.
没错，最后1次决斗，你和我，还有我的玛纳霏。
I’m gonna lose, I know. But I’m not going down easy, alright? You ready?
我知道我会输，但我不会轻易放弃，你准备好了吗？
Alright. Get ready. I want it to be a good one.
好的，准备好再来找我吧，我不希望留下任何遗憾。
I’ve never been happier to throw down against anyone.
我从来没有像现在这样期待与某个人决斗过。
Manaphy’s debut. I don’t care if it’s good or bad. I just want to see it in action. Let’s do this.
玛纳霏的首秀...我不在乎它能不能表现好，我只想看到它战斗时的身姿，让我们开始吧。
You good? I’m ready when you are.
你准备好了吗？我随时都可以。
Ah, wouldn’t have it any other way.
啊，看来就到此为止了。
You know, \PN, you’re a good friend. You don’t pull any punches.
\PN，我一直将你当成朋友，你从不掩饰自身的想法。
I never could beat you, and I’m never going to, but that’s OK.
我从来没有打败过你，或许永远也做不到，但没关系。
You’ve made me better. Helped me out. I hope I’ve helped you too. I really do.
因为你让我变得更好了，你帮了我很多，我也希望能帮到你。
And, uh, yeah, I’m glad I met you.
能够与你相识真是件幸运的事。
Good. I’m – yeah, that’s all I’ve ever really wanted. Manaphy’s happy, you’re happy, I’m happy.
这就是我一直想得到的，你，我，还有玛纳霏，我们都很庆幸这段旅程。
Sorry, that’s just who I am. Big ol’ bleeding-heart, I guess.
抱歉，我一直都是这样，情感一直是我的第一驱动力。
Oh!
哦
Uh, well... I don’t know. I’ll think about it, OK?
呃...这...我不知道，我得考虑一下。
We’ll see each other around. I, uh... I dunno if I see you in that way.
我们还会再见的，我...嗯...我不知道再见时是否还可以像今天这样。
You know. If you’re saying what I think you’re saying.
我想你应该知道我的意思...
...\PN, I really do care about you, though. You’re my friend.
...\PN，我真的很在乎你这个朋友。
And if you need me, I’ll be there, always.
如果你需要我，我会一直在这里。
Well, maybe not always. I’ve got my Pokémon to take care of. But you know what I mean.
好吧，也许不是一直，我还要照顾我的精灵，但大概就是这个意思吧。
I’ve done some stuff I’m not proud of.
我曾经做过一些让我觉得丢脸的事。
I’m gonna come clean: I’ve been working with Yezera on her plans for a while now.
我必须坦白：我和叶泽拉计划这些...已经有一段时间了。
Never felt like I was good enough. Didn’t feel like anyone was good enough for the love we got from our Pokémon. But maybe that was just me projecting.
我不觉得自身是个好人，我不觉得有人能配得上精灵对我们的爱，但...这只是我自身的一种偏执。
Maybe I’m the asshole, y’know? And I’ve known that forever – I’m not that stupid – but it takes a wake-up call to realize it. And this was it.
换句话说，我就是个混蛋！我其实知道...自身没那么蠢...但我需要有谁来提醒我该做什么。
So, yeah, if they want to ruin the world, they can do it without me. And you can stop them with a Phione at your side. Or a Manaphy now, I guess.
所以，如果他们要毁掉这个世界，根本没必要来找我。并且，你可以和霏欧纳...或者玛纳霏一起去阻止他们。
I’ll be thinking about you. Wishing you the best, now and forever.
我会以我的信念，祝愿你能够成功。
Thanks for all of it. If you need me, ever, all you gotta do is ask.
感谢你做的一切，如果你需要我的帮助，随时都可以来找我。
Neither of us is finished, I know that.
我们还没有结束这一切。
I’m gonna try again at becoming Champion next year, I think. Maybe.
或许，明年我会试着，成为这里的冠军？
Future’s uncertain. And you... you’ve got stuff to do, I know.
毕竟未来谁也说不准，你也有一定要去做的事不是吗？
I wish you the best. I’m gonna be thinking about you, I know.
我会以我的信念，祝愿你能够成功。
And if you need me, you damn well better ask me, OK? You’ve taken a weight off my shoulders.
感谢你做的一切，如果你需要我的帮助，随时都可以来找我。
See you around, \PN.

I am studying the biodiversity of Prizca’s underground. It’s...
我正在研究宏礼市下水道内的生物群系，只是...
That’s not inaccurate. The ecological pressures here are novel, to say the least.
这样说也没什么问题，这里的生存压力出乎预料地大。
I am a biologist. We are accustomed to filth.
我作为一名生物学研究者，早已经习惯这种环境了。
If one has an aversion to creatures adapting to life in a sepulcher, then yes.

Perhaps to a trainer. After all, you can catch your preferred selection here just as easily as in the open wilderness, can you not?
或许对于训练师来说是这样，毕竟这里跟其他地方一样，给你提供了很多可捕捉的精灵。
In any case, it is an understudied biome.
总之，这里拥有着人们对其了解甚少的生物群系。
I had rather hoped to find it in pristine condition – as much as a sewer can be pristine – but the avatars have made that difficult.
我本希望能看到这里原本的样子...不过排水设施的存在也让它原始不了。但最大的问题还是这里的化身。
This entire region is undergoing dramatic ecological shifts. I have my concerns.
这个地区正在经历剧烈的变化，我对此感到有些担忧。
Yes. While avatars do not seem to eat or drink, and they do not prey upon other Pokémon, wild Pokémon still avoid them.
没错，虽然化身不需要进食，但它们的进攻欲望实在是太强了，野生精灵都会主动远离它们。
They are, after all, quite large and threatening.
单是那庞大的身形，就已经是一种威胁了。
I noticed a lack of avatars when I went anywhere you’d been before. I thank you for that.

另外我也想确定他们是否尽职尽责，毕竟现在这样...很难不怀疑。
To say more at this point would be baseless slander.
当然，在只有猜测的情况下，我说得越多，就越是诽谤。
If you should happen to want to assist me, meet me there. In fact... I could use someone with a position of perceived competence with regards to battling.
如果你愿意帮我，就一起去大学吧...而且我也需要1个足够强的训练师。
Could you seek me out after finishing your gym challenge?

Between your eight badges and my eight-year degree, I believe our conclusions would demand respect.

Thanks to your Pokemon, I'm always able to zap my TV every time the signal's bad.
多亏了你的精灵，我可以在电视每次出问题时轻松地修好它。

Oh. Are you the one interested in the property?
哦？你对这处房产感兴趣？
Well, that's rather unfortunate. It looks like I've been ghosted by the potential buyer.
不幸啊，潜在的客户消失了。
I mean, I guess I can see why...
嗯...我大概明白了...
Hmm, I'll take that as a no.
嗯，我把这当作1个否定吧。
But yes, this property has been up for sale for a while.
没错，自这里挂牌出售起，已经有一段时间了。
Not many offers though, due to the price and the state of it.
但由于价格和现在的状况，并没有多少人来问。
Excellent, I'll give you a rundown of the place.
太好了，我这就跟你介绍一下。
Obviously it's a fixer-upper. Place has been abandoned for years.
显然，这是栋需要修缮的房子，毕竟已经很多年没住过人了。
It's been a massive thorn in the side of my portfolio. I've been looking to dump it, but the prime location of it keeps the price up.
这就是出售这里最大的难题，虽然我一直找机会推销，但这里毕竟是黄金地段，光是地皮的价格就很高了。
I suppose the type of people to move into this area aren't the type to want trashed places like this.
而想要搬来这边的人，又不会想买这样一栋房子。
Well, I don't know how you still feel about it, but at this point I'm willing to part with this place for $250,000.
现在的价格是250,000金钱，不知道你觉得怎么样。
That's absurdly low, but at this point I'm paying to keep otherwise stress-lost years of life.
这个价格已经很优惠了，如果不是实在不好出手...
It sucks to hear, but I suppose I can't blame ya.
这不怪你，毕竟...
Guess I'll just wait here until another interested party shows.
我只能继续等下1个买家了。
Whoa! Well, yeah, there it is.

Find me at The Tunes, it's a cafe on the northeast end of town. We can talk about it there.
在这座城市东北角有一家叫“乐之家”的咖啡馆，你可以在那里找到我。
I don't see that cash you're talking about, so I'll assume that you don't have it.
你也没能拿出钱啊。
No shame in that, just come back when you got the cash.
没关系，等你有钱了再说吧。

Once in a blue moon someone will send their Pokemon to us from overseas.
偶尔会有人通过募捐精灵球把他们的精灵一并送给我们。
While I appreciate the generosity, it's still quite weird.
虽然我很感激这种慷慨，但这仍然很奇怪。
It also means we have to check the Pokeball donations to make sure they're empty!
所以我们必须检查通过募捐手段拿到的精灵球，确保它们是空的！
We had some pretty uh....interesting scenarios before that policy.
至于为什么需要这样做...呃...以前出现过一些...很有趣的情况。

任何愿意帮忙应对化身危机的人都可以加入护林员。
They're pretty accomodating--anyone who signs up gets stipends for food and board.

It’s my first non-archaeological work – I’m tackling the age-old question of “what’s a Dragon?”
这是我第1次写非考古的文章，我正在解决“什么才算龙”这个古老而又悠久的问题。
Is Charizard a Dragon? What about Milotic? Or certain Exeggutor subspecies?
比如喷火龙，美纳斯，还有某种椰蛋树，这都是龙吗？
To put my findings succinctly, the only way to tell if something’s a Dragon is to hit it with an Outrage.
简而言之，我的研究是，要确定某种事物是否是龙，那就直接用发逆鳞打过去。
That, um, tends to solve the debate rather quickly.
这样...嗯...问题就解决了。
No
算了
Yes
孵化
Yes, please.
现在去
No, I'll go myself.
回头去

A tattered page of customer reviews hangs from the wall.
墙上挂着一页破旧的客户评价。
One attributed to someone named "Oriel" is particularly enthusiastic.
其中有个叫“奥利尔”的人，其评价中难掩喜爱与热情。
Oh. Hello. You’ve caught me at the absolute worst time, you know?
哦，你好，真是不巧，你碰上我最忙的时候了。
I’m technically breaking and entering at the moment.
现在我们都算是非法闯入了。
This used to be a cozy little restaurant run by a friend.
这里以前是我1个朋友经营的小饭馆。
She bought the place, remodeled it so she could cook on the first floor and live on the second, and now it’s this.
她花钱买下了这里，并重新装修，一楼做饭，二楼住人...但现在却变成了这副模样。
Empty.
空荡荡的。
Oh, it’s not so bad. Everything has its season, and in Makya it’s barely summer a day before winter comes.
哈，其实也没那么糟，万物皆有时，而且在马凯亚，夏天刚开始，冬天就要来了。
Constant tumult, this region.
这个地区总是处于动荡之中。
I didn’t believe it at first. That she’d just up and leave.
曾经我是这里最受欢迎的常客，再加上我对锁头很在行。
I figured I was always welcome here anyways, and I know my way around a lock.
起初我并不相信她会突然离开。
Eternally, my savior.
放心，我不会忘的，我的恩人。
And if that flattery isn’t enough for you, I WAS trying to find another way to repay you.
如果只是恭维还不够的话，或许可以用另一种方式来报答你。
Unfortunately, dinner seems to be off the table… no pun intended.
但很遗憾，今天在这里的晚餐已经取消了...哈哈，开个玩笑。
Can you feel that, though? The stillness? I think we’re here for a reason.
我来这里自然还有其他原因，你能感觉到吗，这种寂静？
Let’s look upstairs. You first, though – something’s off, and you’re the brave warrior.
我们上楼去看看吧，你先走...虽然有点不对劲，但我相信你是勇敢的战士。
Not that I want you putting yourself in harm’s way on my behalf… but it would be rather gallant.
不是我想让你为了我而冒险...但这样做会显得相当勇敢。
Oh? I’ll refrain from reading too much into that.
我不会对此做过度解读的。
What I’m worried about is something a bit less fun.
我担心的是...一些不太有趣的事情。
Let’s check upstairs, and be ready. You might end up having to save me again.
我们去楼上看看吧，做好准备，也许你...又得救我1次了。
Am I really that one-note?
我真的那么单调吗？
I’ll have to try and be more creative in the future – I can’t stand being cliché.
我受不了那些陈词滥调...应该找个更有创意的方法。
To answer your question: I hope not, but there’s only one way to find out.
现在回答你的问题：我希望不是，但显然这最合理。
Shall we look upstairs? At your leisure, of course.
我们去楼上看看吧，当然，你随意。
Oh, no. I’m not going up there first. You’re the bold and brash one between us, aren’t you?
不，我不会先上去的。在我们2个之间，你才是那个大胆而鲁莽的人，对吧？
I'm sorry.
抱歉
Why are you here?
你为什么在这？
You owe me.
你欠我1个人情
Huh?
哈？
So do I.
点头
Avatar?
化身？
[Map255]
So it was an avatar after all. Two, in fact! How delightful!
果然是化身！而且有2个！简直是太美妙不过了！
Such grace, such magnificent power, such… oh, words fail me.
如此优雅又宏伟的力量...如此...哦，我不知道该怎么形容了。
But it is a little convenient, isn’t it? The two of us come here.
不过这正合适不是吗？是我们2个来到的这里。
I, the sensitive soul, the pilgrim, and you, the knight, the protector.
我，朝圣者，敏感的灵魂，还有你，骑士，守护之人。
And what should we find but a Gallade and a Gardevoir.
而且我们找到的正好是1个艾路雷朵和1个沙奈朵。
Maybe so, maybe not. In any case, I’m glad I had you walk upstairs first, and I hope you enjoyed the brawl.
或许吧，谁知道呢，不管怎样，很感谢你的骑士精神，也希望你能享受这场战斗。
I honestly envy you. You get to see these avatars up close and truly interact with them. All I can do is view them from afar.
我真的很羡慕你，你可以近距离看到这些化身，并与它们真正互动，而我只能从远处观看。
So it would seem. Appearing in the same biome as their regular counterparts makes sense at first glance.
看起来应该是这样的，即便有一定的生物群系影响。
But even that – how do they choose? Do they choose? Or are they pulled here by something?
可就算如此，它们又是怎么选择的？或者说它们做出主动选择了吗？还是被什么强行安排在这里的？
And if so, where were they before they were pulled here? If only I knew…
如果真是如此，那它们来到这里之前呢？又会在哪儿？如果知道就好了...
Perhaps I did. Not intentionally, but, well, maybe that’s how I view us. Relationship goals or something.
或许我只是无意中知道了，但...嗯...或许这只是我们的视角，强行将关系绑定上去而已。
And somehow that called them, or created them. If so, I’m deeply sorry – I didn’t intend for you to brawl on my behalf today.
至于说将它们召唤过来，或者说创造出来的方法，我很抱歉...我今天其实...真的没有让你为我而战的打算。
And thank you. If you hadn’t showed up, that Gallade might’ve decided I had one too many limbs.
不过还是要谢谢你，如果没有你，那只艾路雷朵或许会把我大卸八块的。
Oh, I can make up for this.
当然，我也有给你的补偿。
Well, what do I know – you probably think an opportunity to fight these things is a gift in itself.
好吧，或许这些不够...但你也可以将与它们战斗的机会本身视作一份礼物。
But in case that doesn’t count as me repaying you, have this back.
如果还不够的话我也没办法了，毕竟朝圣者身上的东西并不多。
It’s told me what I wanted to know – findings I’ll share with you sometime.
它告知了我想知道的东西 - 我也会在某个时刻与你分享我的发现。
I also happened upon this by pure luck while exploring the deep marshes.
这是我在沼泽里找到的。
It isn’t much, but I want you to have it.
虽然不是很值钱，但我想将这个赠予你。
I know this wasn’t exactly what I promised, but I enjoyed it anyways.
我知道这不是1次完美的体验，但我还是很享受这次经历。
I hope you did too, and I’ll see you around. I’ll make it back to you. I promise. Until we meet again.
希望你也一样，我们还会再见的，保重。
Coincidence.
巧合。
It isn't random?
不是随机的？
Did you call them?
你叫来的？
[Map256]
[Map257]
You... you're that Mavis kid, aren't you.
你...你就是那个叫梅维斯的孩子吧。
Pfft, some wannabe aristocrat you are. Old money? You don't even know the half of it.
呸，就你还想着当贵族，你连贵族的门槛都摸不到！
I offer you a deal, the location of my personal private island. Not my family's mind you, mine.
我跟你做笔交易怎么样？这是我私人岛屿的位置，不是我家人的，是我的。
I've never been to it, don't even know what's there. My great-grandmother's estate left it to me.
虽然我还没去过，甚至不知道那里有什么。我曾祖母去世后就是我的了。
If you'd like to go to it, simply beat me. It's not like I care what happens to it.
如果你想去看看，那就打败我吧，我不在乎那里变成什么样子。
THE SPIRITS HERE SCREAM!
这里的灵魂在尖叫！
PLEASE! IT IS TOO BRIGHT!
求求你！太亮了！
HELP ME, LAINIE! HELP ME!
救命，兰妮！救救我！
They can be bested, they can be bested, they can...
它们可以被打败，它们可以被打败，它们可以...
Bestie, it's time to invest in our stocks while they're low. We're accepting bestie buyouts!
姐妹，你看今天的股市了吗，是时候投资股市了！
Time to cash in on the best bonds... get my bestie estate in order...
该把那些债券变现了...该整理好我姐妹的遗产了...
Maybe it's time to invest in you stocks instead...
或许在你身上下注也不错...
Bestie, are you cheating? No...
姐妹，你是不是出轨了？
Good work bestie, we'll be rolling in bestie bucks if we invest in your bestie business right now.
干得漂亮，姐妹，如果我们现在投资姐妹股，那我们的姐妹资产就会滚滚而来。
Hey!
嘿
Hey hey hey hey!
嘿嘿嘿嘿！
OK, so, like, I know what you’re thinking: "Wow, Candy, you’re, like,
嘿嘿，大概...我知道你在想什么，比如“糖儿，你...大概...
super-cool for hanging out in such a super-cool place full of dangerous trainers." And, uh, yeah, thank you for noticing, I totally am.
在这样1个全是资深训练师的地方闲逛真是太酷了。”之类的想法，另外谢谢你注意到了，我的确很酷。
But I’ve got a reason, and it’s not even illegal!
但我有来这里的理由，而且这次不是非法的事情！
So, apparently Tamarind shows up in Whitebloom Town every few months to like check in or whatever, and I just did a li'l recon and...
塔玛琳每隔几个月都会来白花镇，进行检查或者做些其他什么...所以我稍微侦查了一下，然后...
OK, maybe it was actually a little illegal.
呃，好像还是有点违法。
No, shh, I can feel you, like, being judgy right now, and I totally don’t need that energy in my life right now.
别，嘘，我能感觉到，你...大概...在评判我，我现在完全不需要那种能量。
Because she’s the second-in-command of all Team Chasm! Like, duh!
因为她是裂隙队的二把手！大概...就这样！
She’s probably at the top of my hit list – I kinda forgot where I put it and now I can’t find it anymore but it’s almost 100 percent got her name in
她在我的名单上可是待了好久了...虽然我有点记不清名单在哪儿了，但我百分百确定她的名字在上面。
big letters at the top!
而且还是很大的篇幅！
Ugh, I can’t believe how on the same wavelength we are. You are like my buddy cop soulmate.
呃...我完全没想到，我们的思维方式如此一致，你就像是我的灵魂伴侣一般。
Oh, uh, yeah, sorry, hi, love you too. Cool?
哦...呃...对...那个...我也爱你，好吗？
Cool. Let’s talk about the interesting stuff!
我们还是来聊些有趣的事吧！
So, I broke into the abandoned lab and rooted around in there – which, it’s like mega-abandoned and super unsafe but, um, who cares – and found these.
我闯进了这里的废弃实验室，在那里找线索...的确那里已经...很不安全了，但是...嗯...我不在乎...然后就找到了这些。
Um, which is the part where I’d show you the stuff I’d found but I kinda shoved it in my backpack and that place is a total mess.
呃...的确我应该向你展示一下，但我把它塞进背包里了，那个地方又很乱。
So, uh, instead of digging it out, just take my word on it!
所以，嗯...我就不拿出来了，你只要相信我就好！
It’s this like dossier on a whole bunch of old Team Chasm operations that Tamarind must’ve left in there and forgot about!
那时以前裂隙队的一份行动档案，塔玛琳一定是把它忘在那里了。
Oh, all kinds of stuff with these, like, killer names.
嗯，上面有各种各样的，大概...像是杀手一样的名字。
Like “Operation Vagabond Plumage” or “Operation Cardinal Sin” or “Project Theodicy.” It gives me happy chills just thinking about it!
什么“流浪羽毛行动”、“红衣主教行动”或“神论项目”。想想这些就让我兴奋地发抖。
Yeah, but she’s like totally on that grindset 24/7 with running ex-Chasm stuff plus Professor work plus bureaucracy.
是啊，不过她应该是全年无休地忙着运营裂隙队的事情，还要做博士的工作，还要上下打通关系。
I knew she had to slip up eventually! Can’t just chug coffee forever!
就算是一直喝咖啡，她也迟早会失误的！
What? No! No way!
什么？不！不可能
OK, wait, like, maybe that’s a good idea?
诶，等下，大概...也许这是个好主意？
Like, if I’ve already got everything I need to know, I can totally get her to lower her guard by giving it back.
大概...既然我已经知道了我想知道的这些内容，那我完全可以这样来放松她的警惕。
Anyways, the main thing I actually, like,
总之，我实际上...大概...
care about is \nthis after-action report for something called “Project Testament.” Y’know how Velenz is, like, this total ghost town?
关心的是\n这份关于“Project Testament”的行动后报告。你知道维伦兹现在完全是个鬼城吗？
Well if I’m reading this right – and I had to look up a few words but I think I am – Team Chasm caused that!
如果我猜的没错的话...根据我得到的线索，没错...就是裂隙队导致的这一切！
They found some way to make avatars show up and secretly made them swarm the town, ‘cause apparently Velenz was super-resistant to helping.
他们一定是找到了某种方法，让化身出现并秘密地涌向城市，就因为夜幽市对他们的抵制。
Then they, like, intentionally lured avatars into the caves around there to mess up the foundations, and the whole thing started to sink into the mud!
然后他们故意诱导化身进入周围的洞穴里面，破坏一切，让建筑陷入泥潭中。
Seriously, it’s screwed-up!
这真是，太邪恶了！
Yeah! Like, this is the stuff Team Chasm did, and people are still, like, totally OK with them running around!
没错，大概...就是那个裂隙队干的，可人们却任凭他们四处乱跑。
Um... not completely sure, but I’m absolutely certain they did some evil stuff there, OK?
嗯...不是完全确定，但我他们肯定在那里做了很多邪恶的事情对吧？
I don’t know how they did it, or if the whole, uh, what was it called... “soil liquefication?”
我不知道他们是怎么做到的，那个...呃...叫什么来着...“土壤液化”？
Yeah, I dunno if that was intentional or not, but the report is pretty damn happy about it!
没错，我不知道他们究竟怎么想的，但他们显然对成果很满意！
I mean, like, kinda? The report doesn’t really get into the hows or whys that much, but, like, c’mon!
我觉得，大概...有点？报告上没有详细说明愿意之类的，但是...大概...总之！
If you don’t like these people, just, like, fight them? This is messed up.
因为不喜欢某些人就去攻击他们，这简直不可理喻。
No!
不！
No, no, no. No talking.
不，不，不，不要这样！
I know you’re friends with Tamarind, and, like, yeah, she did you a favor, and she’s cool. But this lady has done some evil stuff.
我知道你和塔玛琳是朋友，并且...大概...对，她帮过你，我也觉得她很酷，但她也的确做了很多邪恶的事情。
I’ve got a plan to confront her, and I want your help, alright?
我有1个解决这些问题的计划，而且需要你的帮助，所以？
Once the tournament is about to start, pretty much everybody is gonna be there, so there’s gonna be way less goons just out and about.
只要等到锦标赛开始，会有很多人聚在那边，外面就不会有多少走狗了。
I’ll send her an anonymous li’l letter – ooh, I can cut up the dossiers for letters and glue them together! That’s awesome!
然后我给她寄一封匿名信...对，我可以把档案的内容剪下来贴上去，这个想法真带感！
Anyways, yeah, send her a letter, tell her to come to the <imp>sewer maintenance building on the river banks</imp>. She’ll be there.
总之，我会给她写信，让她她到河边的<imp>下水道维护站</imp>去。她肯定会过去的。
Then you and me – we get some justice.
然后我们...就可以伸张正义了。
Alright? Alright! Great, cool, not gonna let you respond to that because honestly you can’t change my mind!
可以吗？可以的！没错，就这样！我不会给你拒绝的机会，而且你也改变不了我的想法！
You’re my friend and partner in crime and definitely not the minion of an evil mastermind! Toodles!
你是我的朋友，是正义的犯罪伙伴，绝对不是邪恶博士的手下，拜拜！
Hmph, a petty child comes to swing at their superiors. What arrogance.
哼，1个小屁孩居然敢跟自身的长辈交手，真是傲慢无礼。
This... proves nothing. A mere Pokemon battle cannot and will not close the continents of distance between our lines.
这...证明不了什么。一场精灵对决而已，这不会缩小我们之间的差距！
Well, if there is one thing the Mavis line is good for, it's savagery. Go on, get your little prize, I'm sure it costs more than mom makes in a decade.
果然，梅维斯最擅长的就是野蛮，快去拿你的小奖品吧，它抵得上你妈妈十年赚的钱。
What are you trying to talk to me for? Hoping that a shred of my nobility might rub off on you?
你别来跟我说话！想指望我的贵族气质能影响到你？
Look at yourself and tell me you'll be anything close to me. You'd be delusional to think so.
你自身照照镜子看看，你的气质能与我相提并论？简直痴心妄想。
A page labeled "Guardian Secret Location".

It contains a set of GPS coordinates.

I wonder if we're eligable for a bestie rebate, bestie.
不知道我们能不能拿到姐妹回扣，姐妹。
You're our bestie now, of course. Battle besties.
你现在也是我们的姐妹了，对战姐妹。
Legends say there was a Trainer here that lost their arm by feeding it to starving Larvitar.
传说曾有一位训练师，在这里把自身的手臂喂给了挨饿的幼基拉祈。
But legends are legends. For now, I am content with my own story.
但传说就只是传说，现在，我会对自身而感到满意。
Be careful down here.
在这里要小心。
The cave-in that happened around these parts was a tragedy.

Pokemon Lab
精灵实验室
…Are you bored yet?
...你无聊吗？
Of battling, I mean.
我是说战斗。
Only so many Pokémon, so many types, so many moves. Opponents become predictable. Easily manipulated.
精灵的种类就这么多，属性就这么几种，技能不过就一千多个。当了解这些后，对手就很容易战胜了。
I’m so… bored.
我...太无聊了。
You know how much I tried to fight it?
你知道我为了抵抗这种感觉付出了多少努力吗？
I set aside my entire team, trained a new one, and I was still bored. No one could even slow me down.
我1次次丢下之前的队伍，组建新的精灵队伍，但还是一样无聊，没有人能给我带来兴奋感。
So then I only used Bug-types. Only Fire-types. Only unevolved Pokémon. It just got worse.
然后我试着只使用虫属性或火属性，只使用未进化的精灵...结果只是越来越糟。
Everyone’s so predictable. They don’t understand Pokémon the way I do, fight the way I do.
每个人的心思都很好猜，他们不像我理解精灵，也没办法像我一样战斗。
I wandered all of Makya, catching only one Pokémon from each place I visited. Any time they failed me, I released them into the wild.
然后我试着漫游整个马凯亚，在每个地方只捕捉一只，并在它们让我失望时将其放生。
Even that grew old after a few months. The only person that’s broken up that boredom is… you.
几个月后...这也乏味了。唯一打破这种无聊的...是你。
So, \PN, I ask you: are you bored yet?
那么，\PN，我问你：你也已经厌倦了吗？
…Hmph.
...哼。
You will be. Eventually.
你会的。最终。
…So you are like me.
...所以你和我一样。
I’m sorry. I truly am.

Because we can change things.
因为我们可以改变一切。
I can, at least. I will.
至少我可以，而且我会这样做。
…This probably isn’t what you were expecting me to say.
...这可能不是你期望我说的话。
Did you want me to quiver and quaver like a child? Stumble over my words and beg for forgiveness?
你想让我像孩子一样颤抖和哭泣吗？希望我结巴着，乞求原谅？
Sorry. This is me.
对不起。这就是我。
This is the real me – the one I show to my Pokémon. The only ones I can truly talk to. And you.
这就是真正的我...向我的精灵所展示的我，你...是唯一真正可以交流的人。
All of this is going to be clean white stone in a little while. I wanted to come back just to see it one last time.
一切很快...就会变成洁白的石头，我想回来看看它最后一眼。
Couldn’t stand the idea of talking to anyone. Not Mom, not anyone. It won’t matter soon.
不用再强忍着跟任何人交谈，妈妈也是，其他人也是...很快就...都不重要了。
Remaking the world.

The era of human dominance is at an end. With Regigigas’s power, I’ll reset everything back to the beginning.

I want a brand new blank slate.
我想要1个全新的...纯白的世界。
Yes. I am.
嗯，我知道。
Incapable of relating to humans, or even speaking to them.
无法与人类建立联系，甚至无法与他们交谈。
My heart races when they look at me. I am insane, or at least ill. But that doesn’t mean I’m wrong.
他们看着我时，我会心跳加速。我可能疯了，或者有病。但这并不代表我是错的。
I’d expect nothing less. You’re just like me when I was young.
我不奢望你能理解，你跟我年轻时一样。
Wanting to be good. So they’d love me…
想要变得善良，这样他们就会爱我...
…You understand, don’t you?
...你明白，对吧？
Team Chasm uncovered the Regis.
裂隙队发现了雷吉。
Tamarind understood them because she was a scientist. I understood them because they were Pokémon.
塔玛琳因为是博士所以了解它们，我因为它们是精灵所以了解它们。
Regidrago, when humans cowered in fear of monsters.

然后是雷吉奇卡斯，诞生于第1个时代，就在阿尔宙斯创造宇宙之后。
Arceus created, and Regigigas shaped.
由阿尔宙斯创造...由雷吉奇卡斯塑造...
Pokémon were greater, before they became domesticated.
在精灵被驯化之前，它们曾经更伟大。
You’ve seen the echoes of those primordial Pokémon. Soon, that’s what all Pokémon will become.
你已经看到了那些原始精灵的回响，很快，所有精灵都会变成那样。
No, not hostile.
不，它们不是敌对。
You’re so used to Pokémon being loving and subservient that it’s shocking to see them demand respect.
你太习惯精灵的顺从了，甚至因为它们对尊重的要求而感到惊讶。
They’re wild animals. Leave them alone.
它们本就是野生动物，不应该去打扰它们。
What about Rattata? What about Boltund? What about Venipede?
那么小拉达呢？那么电束木呢？那么百足蜈蚣呢？
Just another species. Not privileged. Not the center of the universe. Not anymore.
只是其中一种物种，不再是宇宙的中心，不再拥有特权，
Returned to nothing but white stone.
最终只剩下白色的石头。
Who knows what humans will do from there? I’m sure they’ll find a way. They’re persistent.
谁知道人类会做什么呢？他们总会有自身的办法，一直都那么执着。
I’m good with Pokémon. Very good.
我会跟精灵们相处得很好。
I’ll be better off there than here, that’s for sure.
我会生活得比现在更好，一定。
But I’m wasting your time. I’m only good at one thing, in the end.
不过，我只是在拖延你的时间，最后...我只擅长一件事。
You ready?
你准备好了吗？
…Alright.
...好的。
Care to enjoy the view with me? It’s beautiful.
那就一起欣赏一下美景吧？真漂亮啊。
Good. I know you won’t bore me.
我知道你不会让我感到无聊。
Maybe now you’ll understand – this is the only language that we both speak, in the end.
也许现在你会明白...这是我们最终共同使用的唯一语言。
If we’re friends, you’ll fight me.
如果我们是朋友，你会和我战斗。
If we’re enemies, you’ll fight me.
如果我们是敌人，你会和我战斗。
Rivals, you’ll fight me.

I – I… I care about you too.
我...我...我也关心你。
I’m sorry. I’m sorry – just… just fight me.
对不起。对不起...只是...只是和我战斗。
Show me. It’s the only thing I know.
展示给我看。那是我唯一能懂的事情。
…Then watch as the world you know is erased.
...那就看着你所知道的世界被抹去吧。
It’s that simple.
就是这么简单。
Answer? No, of course not. You won’t stop me here.
答案？当然不是。你阻止不了我。
But it’s how we understand each other better. Show me who you are, \PN.
但这是我们能更好地理解彼此的方式，展示给我看你是谁，\PN。
Oh? You – you really think so? You’ve done so before.
哦？你...你真的这么认为吗？你以前也这样做过。
I’m sure you can. Just try. You’ve never let me down before.
我觉得你能做到。试试看，你以前从未让我失望过。
So, shall we dance?
那么，我们开始吧？
Regieleki, Regidrago, you can go now. Return to your tombs.
雷吉艾勒奇，雷吉铎拉戈，你们可以回到墓穴中了。
You’ll be unmade, too, once this is all done. Just like the eras you commemorate.
一旦这一切结束，你们也将被消灭，就像你们纪念的时代一样。
Do you understand now?
现在你明白了吗？
The real reason? Haven’t I given you enough?
真正的原因？我说的还不够吗？
A world of untapped potential! An end to the boredom! Freeing Pokémon from their saccharine subservience!
1个未被开发的有潜力的世界！不再无聊！解放精灵！让它们不再被奴役！
Fine. You want the real reason?
好吧...你想知道真正的原因吗？
…Not lying. I just haven’t told you everything.
...不是在撒谎。我只是没有告诉你全部。
To free their potential, to free them from humans, and to free… me.
解放它们的潜力，解放它们脱离人类的束缚，解放...我自身。
…Always. Terrified. Not of any Pokémon, never in my life. But always of people.
...总是...害怕。不是害怕任何精灵，我这辈子从来没有过。但总是害怕人类。
That’s why I have to do this.
这就是为什么我必须这么做。
You don’t understand, \PN. If I was good with people like you, I wouldn’t be doing this. But I’m not.
你不明白，\PN。如果我像你一样擅长与人相处，我就不会这么做了，但我不行。
And you know what drives me mad? They should understand that! They should respect it! I saved this entire damn region! I’m a hero!
你知道什么让我发疯吗？他们应该明白！他们应该尊重！是我拯救了这个该死的地区！我是英雄！
And how am I repaid? With prying eyes and paparazzi.
而我得到的回报是窥探的目光和狗仔队的追逐。
I thought if I was good enough, they’d be kind to me. They’d understand me.
我曾以为如果我足够优秀，他们会对我友善，他们会理解我。
Well, I became Champion, and they still made me sick. The thought of having to talk to anyone still terrified me.
可我成为了冠军，他们还是让我感到恶心，我不想跟任何人交流，我害怕跟他们交流。
So I disappeared, and then the ennui came.
所以我就消失了，然后无聊降临了。
Enough. Enough! I deserve to be happy! I deserve to be at peace!
我受够了！够了！我应该得到快乐！我应该得到平静！
If I can’t talk to people, then I’ll create a world where people don’t rule. Where they don’t matter.
如果我不能和人交流，那我就会创造1个人类无法统治的世界。他们不重要！
Pokémon will rule, and I will understand them, and they will understand me.
精灵将会统治一切，我能理解它们，它们也能理解我。
I’ll be the shadow behind the throne, and I’ll – I’ll finally be happy!
我将成为王位背后的影子，我会...我会得到快乐！
I’m so tired, \PN. I’m so very tired.
我很累，\PN。我真的很累。
You can never understand it – living in a world ruled by people you’re terrified of. People you can’t comprehend.
你永远无法理解...生活在1个由你害怕的人统治的世界里...周围都是无法理解的人。
I deserve some rest. I deserve some peace. And this is the only way I’m going to get it.
我应该得到休息，我应该得到平静，这是我唯一能得到的方式。
That’s the real reason. For me. So I can have a world where I belong.
这就是真正的原因，为了我，所以我可以拥有1个属于我的世界。
Do you? Could you ever?
你能吗？
I deserve a chance at happiness. I never got one.
我应该有得到幸福的机会，我从未得到过。
Everyone else did. It’s only fair.
其他人都得到了，不公平。
Oh.
哦。
Oh… well, thank you. If only it changed anything.
哦...好吧，谢谢。但这并没有改变什么。
I do.
我必须。
Or I can remain in this world forever a stranger, wandering without a purpose.
不然我留在这个世界里，作为1个陌生人，漫无目的地徘徊吗？
Would you condemn me to that?
你会谴责我吗？
The Championship is getting close, you know.
锦标赛就要开始了。
I’ll wait for you. Once the Championship ends, I’ll make my preparations.
我会等你。结束后，我会做好准备。
You’ll find me in Regigigas’s chamber. If you decide you want to stop me or join me, meet me there.
你会在雷吉奇卡斯那里找到我。不管你阻止我或加入我，在那里见。
And then we’ll settle things the only way we know how. It’s only right to give you one last fight.
然后我们用我们唯一知道的方式解决问题，给你最后1次战斗。
Goodbye, \PN.
再见，\PN。
Oh? An item was left behind.
哦？有物品被遗留了下来。

Well, I say back in town, but really she's at her habitual moping spot south of the old tower.
当然，我说的是进入镇子，毕竟她经常在南边那个角落里闷闷不乐地想着什么。
I guess nothing's really changed.

Huh? Oh! You must be the Trainer that Scilla was talking about.
你一定是希拉说的那个训练师吧。
She was talking non-stop about your battle with her. Had to see what you're made of myself.

Ready for a battle?
准备好了吗？
Well you better be back. Can't let Scilla represent the Diakos family alone.

Don't let me down, I cut my fishing vacation short for this.
不要让我失望哦，我可是特地提前结束假期回来的。
You're just as Scilla said. A certified skilled Trainer.
果然就像希拉说的那样强，你的确是非常优秀的训练师。

Most Pokeballs are crafted in factories nowadays.
现在大多数精灵球都是在工厂里做出来的。
It's hard to find a specialty ball. For good reason, mind you. There isn't much of a use for some of these compared to Ultra or Great Balls.
这里很难找到某种特殊的球，毕竟大部分花里胡哨的球，用处并没有常规球大。
With that being said, it's nice to craft the aesthetic you wish for. Even if it's a bit hard to do so.
虽然这么说，但能有个独特的外观，也是蛮不错的...虽然很难。
Oh, goodness...
我的天呐...
You've got a truly amazing apricorn in your posession.

Mmmm... exercise some self-restraint, now.
嗯...好吧，我自我克制一下。
Well, if you feel differently later on, I'll be right here.

I've been praying for you to change your mind about that Gilded Apricorn.

Crafting Poke Balls from Apricorns is an old art, but not an exact science.
用树果来制作精灵球，是一种古老的艺术，但并不算一门精确的学科。

Ah, great, then I'll spare myself the time.
啊，太好了，那我就不浪费时间了。
Alright, so when Sweetrock switched over to conveyor belts, a ton of teleporting Clefable suddenly had no role to fill.
自从蜜岩港改用传送带后，对皮可西的需求就减小了。
So I brought 'em here and started training them on long range travel.
因此我把它们带到这里，训练它们进行长距离传送。
Some others had the same idea, but we like to keep everything here on a need-to-know business.
虽然也有其他有同样的想法的人，但我们更希望能将技术掌握在手中。
It might be my lighthouse, but I'm sure as hell not gonna start a fight with who-knows-what for what amounts to mostly vacant space.
这可能是我的灯塔，但我绝对不会为了1个几乎空荡荡的地方和天知道什么东西打架。

Anyways, I've got an issue for you to take care of. I'd do it myself, but, well, I suppose it's a bit beyond me.
说回整体，我有个任务要给你，我本以为能自身处理，但显然有些困难。
It's on an island far off the coast of Makya, so I'll have to have the Clefable send you over.
我们需要去马凯亚海外的1个岛上，所以我得让皮可西送你过去。
I can, uh, also send you the GPS coordinates. Got to meet the maid that drives your boat. Cool girl.

Anyways yeah. Talk to me again if you're ready to go.
等你准备好了再联系我。
So, uh, ready to head out?
所以，你准备好了？

我建议你带上自身最强的精灵，这次的旅程中会有很多挑战。
I've been here.

Dunno what put 'em there, but I need someone to go in and clean 'em out.
我也不知道他们是怎么出现的，但必须得有人去处理一下。
I've cleared at least a dozen of 'em by now, but the avatar of Diancie had to come and ruin my streak.
我已经清理了十几个了，但是蒂安希的化身断了我的连胜。
Gotta say, the news was right. Avatars are tough. Not even a former champ can reliably take 'em.
不得不说，新闻说的对，化身没那么好对付，即使是前冠军处理起来也有风险。
If you manage to get rid of it, we can talk after. You can keep whatever item it drops.
只要你打倒它，就可以来找我拿点酬劳了。
Any luck down there?
进展如何？
No? Keep at it I guess.
毫无进展吗？看来得继续努力了。
So you managed to beat the Diancie avatar? Nice!
所以你打败了蒂安希的化身了？太好了！
Couldn't manage to do that myself. Most of my 'mons didn't have a great matchup against it.
靠我一人对付起来实在困难，我的大部分精灵都被它克制。
Say, my Pokemon are pretty rested now. I bet they'd be keen on having a battle with the team that took out the Diancie avatar.
说起来，我的精灵已经休息好了，我想它们很乐意与能打败蒂安希化身的你战斗。
How 'bout it yeah? Come back when you get rested yourself. Not every day a former champion wants to battle you.
怎么样？你休息好了就来一场吧，前冠军可不是每天都能遇到的。
You ready for a match?
你准备好战斗了吗？
Yeah, sounds good. Whenever is fine.
没问题，随时都可以。
Hah, you've got me pumped for this.
哈哈，你让我兴奋起来了。
Well, well, ain't that something?
没错，没错，这种感觉真好！
You're pretty damn good, I'll give you that. Beating me and that Diancie is impressive.
我必须承认，你真的很厉害，无论是打败我还是那只蒂安希，都是非常了不起的成就。
Might have to call the others warning them that someone might be trying to be the undisputed best.
看来我得警告下某些人，现在有个正试图成为最强训练师的新人出现了。

如果你已经准备好了，可以去宏礼市挑战钢铁道场，它们的馆主希拉也是前冠军。
Other than that, I know Chara's set up in Sweetrock, near the factory.

Well, best of luck on that. I'm probably gonna spend the next week contacting anyone that can get my basement fixed.
好的，祝你好运。接下来我的花一周时间，找人来修一下我家的地下室了。
Ya know, the former champions have got a group chat thing going on.
你听说过吗，前冠军们有1个群。
It's not really active, but it makes me feel like part of something, ya know?

I vomit every time I teleport, but it gets me out of a lot of awkward conversations. Important for business.

You have no idea how many times I've teleported away from family dinners.

Yezera and the others are gone, I’m afraid. It’s just you… and… me.
叶泽拉和其他人都走了，恐怕只剩下你...和我了。
We won. No reason for me to be here. Absolutely none.
我们赢了，我也没有理由继续留在这里了，这回是真的没什么理由了。
Other than the immense enjoyment I’m about to extract from dismantling your team.
除了我即将从毁灭你和你的精灵中获得的巨大乐趣。
A friend of Yezera’s. Besides that, I’m masked for a reason.
我是叶泽拉的朋友，至于我为什么不戴面具...
I would ask who you are, but quite frankly it doesn’t matter. I’m going to find out soon enough.
你是谁，坦白说我不关心，而且我很快就能知道。
There’s only so many types of people in the world.
世界上只有那么几类人。
I just told you: because humiliating you will be fun.
原因自然是：羞辱你会很有趣。
Unless you mean extracting Regidrago, in which case, no, I won’t tell.
如果你问的是这整件事，抱歉，无可奉告。
Humans have this infuriatingly self-destructive need to tell secrets. I’m better than that.
人类有着强烈的泄密欲望，但我不会。
Well, I see the dialogue’s broken down fast.
行吧，已经谈崩了。
Fine. Suffer.
那就开始受苦吧。
But I didn’t come here to engage in small talk.
但我不是来这里闲聊的。
I assure you, it isn’t personal – no one has anything interesting to say. You’re no exception.
在这里没人有心情讲笑话，无论是我还是你。
But you are exceptionally skilled, I understand, and that’s correlated with ego.
我知道你的实力很强，这也是你自负的原因。
Allow me to show you what you’re really worth.
但现在，就让我告诉你为什么是“自负”吧。
…Ah, so be it. I doubt I could drill humility through your thick skull anyways.
...好吧，那就这样咯。看来我没办法让你这油盐不进的家伙懂得谦卑。
You’re good at playing shallow games – good for you.
你只需要擅长玩这种简单的过家家游戏就可以了。
A Totem calls. I’ve seen more than enough.
图腾在召唤我了，我也已经看够了。
They got away. They won. A few that were masked, and whoever the hell THAT was. And Yezera…
他们赢了...也逃走了。包括戴着面具的人，那个家伙，还有叶泽拉...
Wish I knew. That guy was a narcissist and an asshole, I can tell you that much.
我也希望知道。那个家伙...自恋又愚蠢，我只能说出这一点。
The rest of them… who knows.
其他人...谁知道呢。
Could be anything.
任何可能都有。
But if they were after Regidrago specifically, and Yezera’s with them… maybe even leading them…
但如果他们特别在意雷吉铎拉戈，并且叶泽拉和他们在一起...甚至领导他们...
…I don’t know. It doesn’t make any sense.
...我想不通，这不像她。
She should be the last person to pull this kind of stunt.
她应该是去阻止对方的人。
It is. It’s your problem now, and I know you aren’t gonna like that, but it is.
但现在，这是你的问题了，我知道你可能不太高兴，但是这是事实。
This is bigger than just one legendary Pokémon.
这不仅仅是1个传说中的精灵这么简单。
Remember what I said about the big open secret?
还记得我说的那个公开的秘密吗？
The caves around Makya are tombs for the Regis. The weird ones I was talking about before. Ones like this.
马凯亚周围的洞穴是巨人们的墓穴。我说的那些奇怪的东西，就像这个一样。
Well, some archaeological teams went to study them a couple decades back.
几十年前，一些考古队去研究它们。
And then they found the Regis, and the rich mineral veins, and the ruins, and they figured they could leverage that.
然后他们发现了雷吉一族、丰富的矿脉和废墟，他们认为可以利用这些资源。
We got some corporate backing from Andris and Mavis, and boom: Team Chasm. I was one of those original archaeologists.
我们得到了安德里斯和梅维斯企业的支持，于是裂隙队应运而生，我便是最初的考古学家之一。
…Some of us. Helena wanted to run her own region. Andris wanted a piece of the organized crime bigtime.
...有些人想要的是...海伦娜想要属于自身的王国，安德里斯想要成为国际犯罪组织的一份子。
Me, I study the Regis. And some people wanted me to leave well enough alone.
我只负责研究巨人，但有些人希望我别再插手。
I had a Team and Regidrago on my side, and they didn’t, so I got to study what I damn well pleased.
我有一支团队和雷吉铎拉戈的支持，但他们没有，所以我可以研究我想研究的东西。
Some of us. I didn’t. I had five Regis – what did I need money for?
我有5个巨人，不需要经费，但其他人...
If I wanted lab equipment, I sent a list to Helena.
如果需要实验室设备，就会把清单发给海伦娜。
I lived in a research station and ate ramen. Best days of my life.
我当时住在1个研究站里，天天吃着泡面...那是我一生中最美好的日子。
I just wanted to study the Regis, and with their power, nobody could tell me no. Funny how that works out.
我只想研究巨人，而且有了他们的帮助，就没有人能限制我了。有时我也好奇是怎么到那一步的。
You make it sound so pure and noble.
你让它听起来\如此纯洁和高尚。
I was curious. Wanted answers. I got them – who could tell me no with Regidrago at my side?
我只是很好奇，才去寻求答案，我最终得到了想要的答案...又有了雷吉铎拉戈在我身边，还有谁能阻止我呢？
Not to mention the full might of Team Chasm, 'cause my research was VERY profitable.
再加上我还有强大的裂隙队，再加上我的研究非常有价值。
I’m getting to that, but also, hey, it could come in handy some day, yeah?
我正要说这个，但是...也许哪天能派上用场，对吧？
As I was saying: we found the five lesser Regis.
正如我所说：我们找到了5个巨人的塑像。
It took me years, but I deciphered their inscriptions and understood their true nature.
我花了多年时间破译它们的铭文，并理解了它们的真正本质。
That led us to Regigigas, and at that point we were cooking with gas.
这带领着我们找到了雷吉奇卡斯，那时我也在加紧地进行研究。
Gigas was stronger than the rest of the Regis put together, and smarter, too.
雷吉奇卡斯比其他巨人加在一起还要强大，而且更有智慧。
Shape the earth, revert it back to some kind of primordial clay. Create seals and wards that nothing could get through.
它能够重塑地球，将其恢复到某种初始...类似于黏土的状态。还能创建没有任何人能通过的封印和结界。
And, yeah, it could throw a mean Giga Impact.
我想，你也猜到了，它也可以发动猛烈的攻击。
It could do… other things, too. We found a way to make it create ethereal Pokémon with its power.
它当然还可以做其他事情，比如说我们找到了一种方法，可以让它用它的力量创造虚幻的精灵。
They were hostile, powerful – had to be locked away.
但是它们即强大又凶暴，我们只能将它们关起来。
And then by the time Yezera kicked down our door and told us to stop, she was basically just confirming what we already knew.
然后当叶泽拉踹开我们的门并让我们停止时，她的所作所为基本上证明了我们已经意识到的事情。
We were playing with fire. If we kept using Regigigas, we ran the very real chance of destroying the world.
我们在玩火，如果我们继续使用雷吉奇卡斯，将有无意中毁掉世界的风险。
Or at least permanently changing it. So we put each Regi back in their tomb and went legit.
起码也是造成一些永久性的改变，所以我们把每个巨人送回它们的墓穴，然后依照规则处理好了一切。
The tombs were reinforced, of course – just about nothing can get through the minor Regi chambers.
当然，墓穴被加固了...几乎没有谁能穿过那里的防御。
Gigas’s chamber can only be opened by the other five Regis together.
只有其他5个巨人一起，才能打开雷吉奇卡斯的密室。
I don’t know. She agreed with us: it was too dangerous. We were criminals, not lunatics.
我不知道。她对这件事的看法，与我们没什么不同，我们的确做过错事，但不是疯子。
I know things… haven’t been great for her, but this? This is insane.
我也知道她的情况...并不好，但是这...这也太疯狂了。
Who knows. We knew some groups were trying to get them back – they always have been.
谁知道呢，我们知道有些组织一直在试图找回它们。
But succeeding? There was no way. Impossible. But… apparently Yezera can.
但他们不可能成功。只是...叶泽拉似乎是个例外。
…Probably. They might already have.
...可能吧。
Gigas’s chamber is deep down, though, and if they haven’t broken the seal yet, it’d be for nothing.
雷吉奇卡斯的密室在很深的地方，如果他们还没有打破封印，那就是徒劳。
Or if they’ve resealed it. I can try and scout it out, but… no promises.
或者他们又重新封印了它。我可以试着侦察一下，但是...不敢说能发现什么。
My POINT is that if you don’t help out, you better get used to the look of white stone.
我的意思是，如果你不帮忙，你最好习惯全是白色石头的世界。
You’re gonna be seeing a whole lot more of it if someone tells Regigigas to let loose.
如果有人彻底解放了雷吉奇卡斯的力量，那周围的一切都会变成白色石头。
Listen, I don’t know. I don’t know a lot of things.
我不知道，我也不知道！很多事情我都不知道！
So let me talk to Andris, our rangers, Helena, whoever else I can find. We’ll figure out how bad things are.
我觉得应该去跟安德里斯，我们的护林员，海伦娜，还有其他人谈谈。这样才能弄清楚情况有多糟。
And if these thieves show their faces aboveground, you can brawl with them.
如果这些小贼露面了，那就和他们打一场。
They’ve got at least one Regi, probably more, so there’s a strong temptation to wreak havoc. Trust me – I’d know.
他们起码有1个...甚至更多巨人，这让他们无法控制破坏的欲望，这一点我是清楚的。
Hate to say it, but you just need to keep being your usual self, kid.
虽然我不想这么说，但你只要保持平常就可以了，孩子。
Or, no, I shouldn’t call you kid. Take this – you’ve earned it.
或者，不...我不应该叫你孩子了。拿着这个...你一定能用好它。
Used to give these to Chasm strike teams, for cave scouting.
以前给裂隙队用的洞穴探测器。
It’ll get you just about anywhere in the region – nobody hides from you now.
它可以把你带到这个地区的任何地方，现在别人对你来说都无所遁形了。
So go get those badges and save the day, hero.

Hah... deep breaths, Yez. Deep breaths... you met those wraiths, didn’t you?
哈...深呼吸，叶泽拉，深呼吸...你见过那些幽灵了，是吗？
Vestiges of a future that could’ve been. People we know.
我们所熟悉的人，是本应发生的未来的痕迹。
I guess they were drawn to us, somehow. It’s – I can’t think about that right now.

When everything’s coming to a halt, you can’t really afford the luxury of teenage rebellion.

I’m a specter, \PN. My timeline is crumbling to ash. I don’t know if it even really exists.
我是1个幽灵，\PN。我的时间线正在逐步崩解为灰烬，我不知道它是否还真实存在。

你以为我没有自身的叶泽拉吗？我说你会是第二重要的原因...我会为最重要的叶泽拉感到自豪。
This one’s beyond repair, though. You deserve better than a girl that’d destroy the world over her social anxiety. She’s quite literally insane.
至于这个已经无法修复了，你应该找1个比她更好的女孩，而不是1个因为社交焦虑而毁灭世界的疯子。
Get rid of her and go back home to your Mavis. She’ll love you even more now that you’ve proven yourself so cleanly.
不要再管她了，回家找你的梅维斯吧。她会更爱你，因为你...已经证明了自身的清白。
She’ll give you a role in life to fulfill, and protect you forever. Even to the end of the world, you’ll have a place.

拜托，不要这样对我。我很抱歉！
I’m sorry, and I know I deserve it. You should be doing way worse to me.
我很抱歉，我知道我应该受到惩罚，你应该翻倍施加于我。
I’m sorry. I just... I had to. I need to matter. I need to be treated like a human being.
对不起，我只是...我不得不这样做，我需要有价值，我需要像个人一样被对待。
I need people to appreciate me, because I’m – I deserve it!

That makes Ice-type your silver bullet. She'll have some answers for it, but it's still a counter.

Flying and Rock are your next best bets. Steel is pretty good as well, since it resists both of her typings.

Best of luck in the final stretch of your Gym run.
祝你在最后的道馆好运连连。

You – you let her by? I – I trusted you!

Jeanne, you were right. Butcher this creep.
让娜，你说的没错，我这就干掉这家伙！
You beat me. Fine! Fine!
好吧，你赢了！
I don’t care! What does it matter? Of course you’re better than me! Everyone is!
但又能怎么样呢？你当然比我更强！每个人都比我更强！
...You don’t know how, like, completely tempting it is to kick you while you’re down.
你不知道我现在多想狠狠踢你一脚！
You’d deserve it. But I should let you get up. I know I should.
所以，我应该让你站好，然后狠狠地...哼！
...So what now? You want to go skitter off and eat treats out of Tamarind’s hand? Fine! See if I care!
那现在怎么办？你跑去塔玛琳那里领奖励？好啊！我才不会在乎你的选择！
You can burn for all I care. I – I hate you!
你就算被烧死也跟我无关，我...我恨你！
I. Don’t. Care! You’re not better than me!
我  才  不  在  乎！
Everyone’s always trying to show they’re better than me because they’ve got the law on their side!
就因为有法律的支持，每个人都在试图证明他们比我强！
Or they’re older, or bigger, or a better trainer! Well you’re all idiots! You’re all corrupt! You should all just die!
或者是因为更老，经历更多，还是其他的什么原因...你们都是一群白痴！一群腐败的蛆虫，你们都该去死！

I should’ve trusted Jeanne about you.
我就应该听让娜说的...
...It’s over. Everything is over.
...结束了，一切都结束了。
Funny. It’s, like, honestly hilarious.
真是...1个可笑的结局。
I was gonna help Yezera end everything! Reset it all!
我本来要帮叶泽拉结束一切的！明明能重置一切！
And now I don’t even want to! Screw that. You don’t deserve justice. None of you do! Why would I want to make everything good?
现在我甚至都不想了！随便！你们不配得到正义！你们都不配！为什么只有我想让一切变好？
Then I don’t get the pleasure of tearing it down! It’s pointless anyways! Nothing I do is ever going to matter!
哪还有破坏它的乐趣？无论我再做什么都没有意义了。
People are all just corrupt lapdogs like you, \PN. Thanks for showing me that.
人类都像你一样，是腐败的走狗，\PN，谢谢你让我看清了这一点。
I guess you got what you wanted – screw Yezera. I’ll take care of this world myself. My way.
我猜你得到你想要的结局了，叶泽拉要怎样现在跟我无关。我会用我自身的方式，1个人照顾好这个世界。
Toodles, \PN. I’d say I hope I never see you again, but, like, honestly? It’s the opposite.
再见了，\PN。我想说我希望永远不再见到你，但是...说实话，恰恰相反。

我只是希望有人能为过错买单，但你，毁了这一切！
I hate you, \PN. If you follow me, I WILL sic Jeanne on you.
我恨你，\PN。如果你敢跟着我，我会让让娜好好收拾你一顿。
Toodles, you miserable pig.

Hauling crates all day is hard work.
每天都要装货卸货好辛苦...
The Timburr and Gurdurr are good help, but I'd really like to have another helper around here.
的确，搬运小匠和铁骨土人帮我们分摊了大部分的工作，但我们依然需要新的帮手。
Any Fighting-type should be able to handle the workload.
只要是格斗属性的精灵就行。
I've got a Galarian Ponyta to offer, got it as a gift from my girlfriend overseas.
我这里有一只伽勒尔的小火马，可以作为交换条件。
I'm sure she'll understand. Wanna trade?
这是我海外的女友给我的礼物...我想她会理解我的难处的（可在箱子里选择精灵）...
Well in that case, happen to have a back brace on you by any chance?
你是身上没有带，还是有其他什么原因？
Hmm, maybe I just need to take more breaks.

That Pokemon seems just right for the job.

Looks like the Trainer ahead is moving to block you from going any further.
前方的训练师显然不会允许你通过。
Do you want to approach them? It looks like a tough fight.
要贸然靠近他们吗？这将是一场恶战。
I knew you would seek Yezera. I am her humble servant, naturally, though I would rather keep my identity enshrouded.
我知道你会寻找叶泽拉，我是她的谦卑仆人...当然，我更希望没人知道我是谁。
Pray excuse the charade – it will not be necessary for much longer.
至于这份伪装，请别在意...很快就不再需要它了。
Under Yezera’s profound guidance, we have achieved our goals. The titans have served their purpose.
在叶泽拉的指导下，我们已经完成了目标，巨人们已经完成了使命。
I come then with a simple inquiry: will you not listen to my reasoning?
现在有1个简单的问题：你就不想听一下理由吗？
Thank you. Our goal is naught less than a complete reordering of the world.
谢谢，我们的目标，不仅仅是为了重构这个世界。
My comrades have their own motives, but mine is simple.
每个人都有自身的动机，而我的愿望很简单。
The world at present is mercurial and deceptive. Human culture and technology serves as naught but a veil disguising ultimate truth.
目前的世界充满了欺骗与变化，人类的技术与文化，都在掩盖本应被大家知晓的真相。
Only the realm of ancient myth, tended by gods, untouched by humans, might let us perceive it. Do you not agree?
只有古老神话的领域，在神灵守护中，未曾被人类触及，才得以让我们触碰到真实。你不同意吗？
How disappointing, to dismiss it outright. If you have no eye for truth, then we have nothing else to speak of.
你竟然直接否定了这一切。既然你没有看清一切的眼光，那也就没什么可说的了。
Forgive me this act of passion, but I expect a titan’s wrath may settle my raging heart.
请原谅我的情绪波动，但巨人的愤怒将会抚平这一切。
Regice, heed my command.
雷吉艾斯，听我号令。
To the contrary: it has adamant support, if only one ruminates on the matter.
只要人们肯深入思考，就会发现这一切是对的。
Such wavering faith is nigh-useless for my purposes, alas. We require unflinching devotion.
但这种满是动摇的信仰对我的目的没有任何作用，我们需要更加坚定的信念。
*sigh* I would be forsaking my duty if I did not stall you at the least. Prepare yourself.
*轻笑声*为了履行我的职责，起码要拖延你前进的进程。做好准备吧！
I should encourage you to do so. Judge the weight of the world that is against the world that could be.
我很高兴你愿意这样做，去评估世界的重量，对比真实与虚伪。
Alas, I know you will not ruminate idly upon it. You are a threat. That is intolerable to us.
但我不会就这样等着，现在的你仍是威胁，我们无法容忍的威胁。
This shall be no decisive victory of mine, but I cannot let you pass unhindered.
我知道想要赢你并不容易，但也不能让你轻松通过这里。
…I should very much like to believe you.
...我也很希望能相信你。
If you speak truth, then I bid you repeat your convictions to Yezera herself next you meet.
如果你真是这样想的，那下次见到叶泽拉时，请重复你刚才的想法。
She can see the machinations of your heart more clearly than I. Until then, you remain a trainer, as do I.
她比我更擅长看清别人内心的阴谋，但现在我们仍然是对手。
My enemy I smite, my ally I train. To either, en garde.
而对手，就是要打倒的。
If you will not listen to my entreaties, then you are beyond salvation.
连最基本的倾听都不愿意，也就代表你已经无药可救了。
Alas. Perhaps a titan’s fury will enlighten you to the clarity of the ancients.
唉，或许巨人的怒火，能让你清晰地认识到这一切。
G’afternoon. Took your sweet time comin’ to find Yezera 'gain, didn’t ya?
下午好，为了来找叶泽拉，你也花费了不少时间对吧？
Got no interest in convincing you. Ain’t much of a preacher.
我没有说服你的兴趣，我也不擅长这种工作。
But I gotta set some ground rules 'fore we fight; establish some things. 'Cause we’re gonna fight. Ain’t no other way to it.
但在我们战斗之前，我还是得先说明一些事情。
Thank you kindly. I ain’t real interested in this cloak- and-dagger charade.
非常感谢，首先我对这种披着面纱的阴谋毫不感兴趣。
I’m with Yezera, always.
我只是一直在帮叶泽拉做事。
Listen, I’m only gonna say this once: you oughta hear her out.
注意，我只说1次：你应该去听听她的意见。
Don’t care if you agree with her. Just hear her out.
无论你是否认可她的想法，只是去听听，应该不难吧。
And if you hurt her, I’ll make you wish Mavis stopped after Zain. We clear?
但是如果你伤害到她，我会让你输给赞恩的，明白了吗？
Cocky li’l brat, ain’t ya? Tsk.
真是个自大的家伙。
What’s so damn infuriating 'bout you is I ain’t just able to whip your sorry hide into submission. Too good.
然而让我不爽的是，我没办法轻松打倒你，你的确有些实力。
How 'bout I try anyhow? Titan’s gotta be good for somethin’, right?
所以就来试试吧，看看巨人拥有怎样的力量。
Good. I ain’t 'bout ta repeat myself.
好的，我不想重复自身的话。
Now, I came here with a job to do, and I’m a reliable sort.
现在，作为1个可靠的队友，我还是得完成自身的任务。
Sorry, kid. Yezera wants some peace 'n' quiet. Regice, lead us off, will ya darlin’?
抱歉了，小家伙。叶泽拉现在不能被打扰，我得让你放慢一些脚步。上吧，雷吉艾斯！
Hah. Take it from someone who knows, kid: you ain’t even scratched the surface.
哈，我只能以我的经验告诉你，你甚至连表面都还未触及到。
I can make you plenty more miserable if I set my mind to it.
只要我想，我还能继续拖你的时间。
But, cheer up, kid. I’m 'bout to give ya what you always want: a good fight. Facing a Regi oughta cheer ya up. Heh.
不过，你应该想要一场优质的对局吧？面对雷吉艾斯，或许能让你振奋起来。
Nah, I ain’t about to trust that. Ya don’t know jack about me and Yezera.
哼，我才不信这句话！你根本不了解我和叶泽拉的事。
Bickering old married couple, that’s what we are.
我们已经是经常拌嘴的老夫妻了。
Want to show me you’re with us? Tell it to Yezera.
如果要证明你的想法，那就把这些想法告诉她吧！
For now, I ain’t too keen on letting you off easy. Sorry. Beating folks into the dirt is my job, after all.
但现在，我不会让你轻易脱身的，将你打得落花流水就是我的工作。
Ah, well. Guess no matter how hard I try, old habits die hard.
呵，好吧，不管怎么努力，老习惯还是不肯消停啊。
Speaking of dying hard – lay down and quit moving, will ya?
说到这里...现在得请你消停一下了。
Hah. They ain’t never been happy with my way of goin’ about covert ops.
哈哈，他们也觉得我不擅长秘密行动。
Too rough 'nd tumble. I ain’t built for cloak-and-dagger.
我行事太过直白粗暴。
So, let me tell you straight: you listen to Yezera. You hear her out. And don’t you dare hurt her.
所以，我就直白地告诉你了：去听取叶泽拉的意见，倾听她的想法，不许伤害她。
All I ask. And, uh, I wasn’t just sent here to chit-chat. You ready?
这就是我唯一的要求。当然我也不是来找你闲聊的，现在你准备好了吗？
Oh, hello.
哦，你好。
Such a picturesque place to meet. If only it were under better circumstances.
在这么1个美丽的地方相遇，如果情况能更好些就完美了。
Regice and I have unfortunately been told to make sure Yezera has no unwelcome visitors.
然而，我被要求来这里，确保叶泽拉不欢迎的访客无法继续前进，所以我跟雷吉艾斯便在这里等着了。
Before that, though… I know you’re more than a pretty face. You’ve got a spark to you. Will you listen to me?
我知道你不仅有好看的面容，还有着聪慧的大脑，所以在交手前能听我说完吗？
Aww. I knew I had a good feeling about you.
啊，我就知道你是个好人。
How do I explain it… well, I hate to use the word, but modern society is degenerate.
我该怎么解释呢...嗯...我不想用这个词，但现代社会的的确确是堕落的。
We’re distant from the perfect moment of creation. We’ve kind of taken over the world.
我们远离了神创造的完美世界，对一切掌握得过多了。
No respect for our elders – the primordial Pokémon that created the universe.
我们并没有给予创造宇宙的精灵足够的尊重。
Yezera’s going to reset this world back to its origins. And then humanity will be in the bosom of Arceus once more.
叶泽拉将会把一切回溯到起源，届时人类将再次回到阿尔宙斯的怀抱。
Don’t call me insane. Although I’m sure this arrogant, faithless civilization would use that term.
不许用这个词来称呼我，这是傲慢又没有信仰的文明才会用的堕落词汇！
I’m merely devout, and devotion means making sacrifices. For example: you.
我只是虔诚而已，虔诚即意味着做出牺牲。就好比：你。
I really do like you, but… we all have to sacrifice sometimes.
我真的很喜欢你，但是...牺牲是绝对不可避免的。
Godlike Pokémon are now treated as not much more than beasts of burden.
那些神明一般的精灵现在都被看作是牲畜一般。
Avatars are destroyed at will because they’re “threats to humans.”
化身被肆意地破坏，就因为它们是“对人类的威胁”。
The world has lost all respect, the divine essence from creation diluted and destroyed.
这个世界已经毫无尊重可言，神圣的本质被稀释、破坏。
And since you seem to be no different, I can take some joy in this fight.
既然你也没什么不同，那就在这场战斗中获得一些乐趣吧。
Arceus created the world. It is pure, and perfect, and resetting the world back to its original form will let us be pure and perfect too.
阿尔宙斯创造了这个世界，它是最纯净、最完美的，而重置后的我们也会变得纯净和完美。
I’d like to see myself blessed by the grace of our creator.
我想要得到神的恩典与祝福。
I’d like to see you that way, too.
我希望你也能得到这些。
In time.
时间差不多了。
For now, I’ve been ordered to remove you. Shall we dance?
我接到的命令是拖延你的时间，那么现在，我们起舞吧？
Good. I knew I saw something in you.
很好，我知道你身上迸发出了什么。
Some spark of faith. I’m a… very good judge of character.
那是一些信仰的火花，而我是1个...善于识人的人。
I’d love to just talk with you for a while, but I was explicitly instructed to stop you. So we’ll fight. Don’t take it personally.
我很想和你多聊一会儿，但我的任务是要阻止你，所以我们还是要对决，这跟我个人的情感无关。
Oh. Was I too forward?
哦，我太直接了吗？
My emotions tend to get the better of me. I’m almost heartbroken.
我总是会被自身的情绪控制，我现在心都要碎了。
Well, I suppose I am a stranger.
也对，我现在是个陌生人。
Fortunately, I’ve been sent to ensure you make it no farther, so I have a convenient vent for all these feelings of rejection.
好在我的任务就是来拖延你，眼前正好有1个方便的出气口，释放掉这些被拒绝的痛苦。
Hello, friend. Yezera wishes to be alone.
你好，朋友，叶泽拉想要独处一会儿。
To that end, I have been sent, and graciously afforded a titan to aid me.
所以我被派到这里来了，还带着1个巨人。
Before we attend to your removal, however, may I interest you in a short, frank discussion?
不过在我把你赶走之前，可以先做1个简短的讨论吗？
I would rather like to try to convince you of the legitimacy of our position.
我想试着说明我们的立场是正确的。
Thank you for your time.
感谢你的时间。
Yezera’s goal is to recreate the conditions of the world shortly following its creation.
叶泽拉的目标是重现世界诞生后不久的样子。
Modern science has attained almost complete understanding and mastery over the world – the modern world.
现代科学已经几乎完全理解和掌握了现在的这个世界。
It cannot, however, understand the past. By reverting existence, we may study the universe from its conception and obtain universal knowledge.
但是，却无法理解过去。通过回到过去，我们就可以研究宇宙开始的概念，并获得宝贵的知识。
This is the only way to do so.
这是唯一的方法。
Without the reversion, humanity will never attain complete understanding of the universe. It is worth all prices.
如果不这么做，人类将永远无法理解宇宙，这些代价是值得的。
Now our time for conversation is up, however. Regice, please do the honors.
现在，交流时间结束，雷吉艾斯，开始行动。
All persons who attempt to advance civilization should care.
所有试图让文明得以推进的人都应该关心。
Universal knowledge is a prerequisite for an all- powerful society.
知识普及是使文明进入新时代的先决条件。
That is my goal. That is the goal of all science: to know, and to apply that knowledge.
这是我的目标，也是所有科学发展的目标：理解，并运用那些知识。
Your ignorance implies discussion will get us nowhere. Let us dispense with such, then.
你的无知也就代表着，我们的讨论不会有任何进展，那么就没有继续下去的必要了。
Knowledge will be retained into the new primordial era.
知识将被保留到新的原始时代。
We can rebuild at least small enclaves of humanity.
我们可以重建人类的小聚落。
From there our analysis and conquest will begin: a new society with absolute knowledge.
并以此为基准开始分析与征服，并发展为1个拥有绝对知识的新社会。
And, stemming from this absolute knowledge, absolute power.
同时，还会因为绝对的知识，拥有绝对的力量。
Consider it. In the mean time, there is the business I mentioned earlier. Excuse me.
考虑一下吧，与此同时，我也该执行接到的任务了。
I am glad you have the wisdom to agree. If you should wish to support us in our endeavors, I will be happy to have you.
我很高兴你拥有这份智慧，如果你愿意支持我们的事业，我很高兴能有你的加入。
We will fight for a more enlightened era. For now, however, I must slow you. Business is business. Let us commence.
我们将为1个更开明的时代而战，但现在，我必须阻止你。任务如此，让我们开始吧。
I find this highly unfortunate. You will be left behind by progress.
这并不是1个正确的选择，你将被进步抛在脑后。
If you would prefer to retain your ignorance, however, I cannot help you.
然而，既然你自愿保持无知，那我也无能为力。
Prepare yourself. Regice, if you would.
准备好了吗？雷吉艾斯，出击。
Yo. Figure’d, uh, yeah, that you’d be here.
嘿，我就猜你会在这里。
Yezera’s here. You keep running into her. She, uh, doesn’t really want to talk right now.
没错，叶泽拉也在这里，但你总是打扰到她...她...呃...现在不想说话。
I got a job to do, but, uh, not keen on it.
现在这个任务...呃...我不太喜欢。
So you want to hear us out?
我该怎么说呢...你有兴趣听听我们的想法吗？
Swear we’ve got some good reasons. Even if I’m not that good at putting it in words.
但是...你应该明白，我们不想与你敌对，你觉得呢？
Oh. That’s good. Great. Honestly didn’t expect that.
哦，那太好了！真的没想到...
Well, I just figure we’ve done a lot of ordering Pokémon around.
我只是觉得我们不应该将那么多命令强加给精灵。
Maybe it’s time to even up the footing a bit, y’know?
也许是时候让我们站在同样的地位上了，大概...
We can all kinda make up for whatever we did wrong.
我们有机会弥补以前所犯的错误。
The others have their reasons, but, uh, this is mine. Make a world where we can be forgiven. You get it?
其他人有他们自身的理由，但...呃...这是我的理由。创造1个我们可以被原谅的世界，你能理解我的意思吗？
Well – fine. You know what? Fine.
好吧...你有自身的想法。
I don’t need your permission, and we certainly don’t need your help. Regice. Do ‘em in.
当然，我不需要你的认可，也不需要你的帮助，雷吉艾斯，干掉他。
…You so sure? Takes a lot of pushing to train a team that strong in so little time.
...你确定？这么短的时间内训练出这么多强大的精灵，这得需要多大的压力啊！
But, yeah, no, I get it. Why would you help us?
但是，啊...我明白了，你并没有帮助我们的理由。
Rich brat. Maybe we can beat some responsibility into you.
毕竟你是个富家子弟，你应该承担起更多责任。
Uh. Don’t really know how to break it to you. You… don’t have time.
嗯，我不知道该怎么说...你...没有思考的时间了。
For one, we’ve already just about won. For two – think fast!
首先，我们已经快成功了，其次...我还有自身的任务。
Regice, sweep ‘em off their feet!
雷吉艾斯，把他解决掉吧！
Oh. Didn’t, uh, really expect that.
哦，没想到会这样。
Figured you were kind of a stuck-up brat. No offense.
我本以为你就是个自大的富家子弟...抱歉，请不要介意。
Well, good. Maybe we’ll be side by side one day, yeah?
好吧，也许有一天，我们会并肩作战，对吧？
But, uh, for now… I’m supposed to fight you.
但是，现在...我应该和你战斗。
So, uh, sorry – ah, what am I saying, we live for this. Ready up.
所以，抱歉...啊，我在说什么，都到这一步了...准备好了吗？
Yeah, I guess that tracks.
哈，我觉得也会是这样。
Fine. That’s… it’s fine.
好吧，没关系。
I came here to beat the crap out of you anyways.
我来这里就是为了揍你一顿的。
Odds are Regice isn’t gonna stick around much longer, so let’s make it count. Try your best, eh?
雷吉艾斯很快就要离开了，所以我要尽可能地利用好它。
Well. Had to happen eventually, I guess.
嗯...我知道迟早有这一天。
I’ve kinda sorta been planning what to say for the past few hours.
这几个小时我一直在计划要说些什么。
But, um… I still don’t know. So can I just say what comes to mind and hope you understand?
但是，嗯...我还是不知道，所以我只能说出心里想的话，你愿意听听吗？
Welp. Listen, uh, Makya’s kinda in a weird place right now.
嗯...差不多...呃...马凯亚现在的情况很糟糕。
Team Chasm ran roughshod over this whole region and then kinda just… got away with it?
之前裂隙队在这里到处肆虐，然后就这样...撂挑子走了？
So, uh, yeah, if you ever wanted proof that humans can’t get even the most black-and-white justice right, there you are.
所以，这就是人类甚至连正确分辨是非善恶都做不到的最直接的证据。
Would’ve been simple to fix that little screw-up. But they didn’t.
本来很容易就能处理这些问题的，但他们没有这样做。
So we’re taking the power away from humans, and putting it in the hands of Pokémon.
所以我们要把权力从人类手中夺走，交到精灵手中。
Is it? Is it!
啊？这就是答案吗？
Am I insane for wanting some damn PUNISHMENT in this world?!
我就是希望他们得到应有的正义审判，是我的问题吗？
Well, guess what. If people won’t give me it, I’ll MAKE it.
行，无所谓了，既然大家不愿这么做，那我就自身去审判。
And I’ve got just the tool!
而我有很好的帮手！
It is simple, you – you idiot!
这明明很简单，你...你个白痴！
I can track down every ex-Chasm criminal and haul them up to the courts myself if I have to!
只要想这么办，我可以把每个裂隙队成员，亲自拖到法庭上受审。
They just won’t do anything if I did! So I have to do things personally, yeah?
但他们什么都没有做！所以我必须亲自去做这一切！
Sorry. Nothing… personal.
抱歉，这不是个人恩怨。
Yes!
没错！
They’re noble and pure and – and – and they’d never let me down!
他们高贵而纯洁...他们永远不会让我失望！
Unlike you! And everyone else around here!
不像你！还有你周围的每个人！
You want to see? C’mon. See what kind of justice Pokémon can give!
要见识一下吗？看看精灵能给出什么样的正义吧！
Oh. Ah-hah.
哦，啊哈。
Kinda got myself a bit worked up there… welp, no harm, no foul, yeah?
咳咳...有点激动...不过无伤大雅。
…Nah, that’s stupid.
...不，还是丢脸...
I’m not gonna waste this chance. I’ve got a Regi. You’re a prodigy. Let’s RUMBLE!
无论如何，我不会浪费这个机会，毕竟手里有1个巨人，我们来战吧！
Urgh, you make me so mad!
你让我很生气！
Nobody will frickin’ listen to me!
没人听我说话！
Fine.
好吧。
Y’know, fine, whatever.
好吧，随你便。
You get what everyone else I fight gets. What you deserve.
你会在我这里品尝到应有的失败！
Regice – your service has ended. If you would go, then go.
雷吉艾斯，你的任务结束了，你可以凭自身的意愿离开了。
So it returns to its resting place… no matter. It has done all I desired and more.
它现在回自身的安息之低了...但它已经超额完成了我的目的。
As for you, we shall meet again.
至于你，我们会再见面的。
When and where, fate shall decide, though I think I know where we shall settle this.
命运将会决定我们何时再相见。
Do not pursue me. Your audience with Yezera awaits.
不要跟过来了，叶泽拉还在等你。
Seems Regice’s 'bout spent.
看起来雷吉艾斯已经快不行了。
Didn’t exactly expect them to be so squirrelly, but them’s the breaks.
没想到你竟然这么难缠，但也不觉得意外就是了。
Figure it’s headin’ back to its home.
它应该已经在回家的路上了。
One last thing, since you seem ‘bout ready to see Yez again: you hurt her and I’ll find you.
最后，既然你打算去见叶泽拉，如果你敢伤害到她，我会立即来收拾你。
And it won’t just be for some play fight with animals.
到时候就不是精灵之间的对决了。
G’evening, kid. I’ll be seein’ you. Keep in mind how nice it feels to be havin’ all your bones intact.
晚安，小家伙，我们还会再见的，当我们再见时，希望不是你让我怒不可遏的时候，好吗？
Au revoir, Regice. Enjoy your entombment, I suppose.
再见了，雷吉艾斯，享受你的安宁吧。
And as for you, I’m breathless. Speechless. You’re even better than I imagined.
这真是一场激动人心的战斗，你比我想象中要强得多。
If you’d like to stop your pointless struggling against us, tell Yezera.
如果你想停止无意义的纷争，就来找叶泽拉吧。
We’d love to have you. Until we meet again…
我们很希望你的协助，直到我们再次相遇...
I surmise Regice will now return to its tomb.
我想雷吉艾斯应该回它的墓穴里面去了。
The titans are temperamental and ill-suited to existence outside their crypts.
巨人们的情况很特别，不能长时间待在墓穴外。
It is of no matter. Our victory comes soon.
不过这无关紧要，我们的胜利即将到来。
Yezera may be displeased in my performance, but she is understanding.
叶泽拉可能会对我的表现不满，但她肯定能理解。
In the end, this will make no difference. Thank you for your time.
最后，我不会再阻拦你，谢谢你的时间。
See ya, Regice.
再见了，雷吉艾斯。
Ah, who am I kidding.
啊，我在开玩笑。
If either of us is gonna see it again, it’ll be you. Couldn’t really hold a candle to you.
果然我无法与你相提并论，我相信你或许还能再见到它。
Had to try anyways, just for Yezera. And I’m gonna have to do it again, right?
但我无论如何都要尝试一下，只是为了叶泽拉。
Good practice, I guess. Well, think about it – everything, y’know? I’m out.
我觉得这是场不错的训练，现在我该走了，去思考一下这一切。
*sigh* So long, Regice. You never really were my type, anyways, so head on home.
*叹气*再见了，瑞吉艾斯，你从来都不是我想要的类型，所以你可以回去了。
And as for YOU, well, next time we talk it’ll be in a fair world!
至于你，下次，我们会在1个公平的世界里交谈！
If it isn’t, then, uh, I’ll have to buy us a li’l more time, 'kay?
如果不是的话...那么...大概...那就再多给我点时间好吗？
Until then, I’ve got judgment to be a-judging. So long, "hero."
估计我还要再努力一下了，再见，“英雄”。

Eventually landed on Togepi as my main thing. Threw in the occasional Eevee when I felt like it.
我一般都会把波克比送给他们，偶尔也会给某些孩子一只伊布。
Made a killing, you know. Didn't even need to get a new job when the Lab closed up shop.
在这个过程中，我赚了不少钱，甚至在实验室关闭后不需要找新工作也能过得很舒适。
Nowadays I spend my days fishing away at the Lake.

No one knows why, but they've been doing it ever since the cave-in eight years ago.
没人知物品体原因，自从八年前那里塌方之后，就一直这样了。

Regigigas seems to falter, its resolve broken.
雷吉奇卡斯似乎动摇了，它的决心破灭了。
The primordial power within it dies down, and it regards you with calm eyes.
其中的原初力量消散了，它用平静的眼神看着你。
Regigigas considers for a moment, perfectly still. Then it assents, moving with heavy steps to aid you.
雷吉奇卡斯沉思片刻，一动不动，然后它同意了，沉重地迈步前来帮助你。
Regigigas inclines slightly, perhaps imitating obeisance. Then it rights itself and stands at your side.
雷吉奇卡斯微微点头，或许在模仿臣服。然后它站直了身子，站在你身旁。
Regigigas regards you with an analytical gaze. Then it hums and steps forward with certainty.
雷吉奇卡斯用分析的目光看着你，然后它哼了一声，自信地向前迈步。
Regigigas thrums loudly and violently. Then it clenches one hand and flares with a bright surge of power for a moment.

...You made it.

This is where Regigigas was interred. Where I ended Team Chasm. Where I wandered in my boredom, and where I began to speak to Regigigas.
这就是雷吉奇卡斯被埋葬的地方，我终结了裂隙队，在无聊中徘徊，开始与雷吉奇卡斯交谈。
Told it what I wanted, what I feared, what I planned. And I heard it, lamenting the golden age.
告诉它我想要什么，我害怕什么，我计划什么，我听到它在哀叹黄金时代。
We reached an understanding. And then it started its work within its tomb while I collected the other Regis to finally set it free.
我们达成了合作，它开始在自身的墓穴内工作，而我则收集其他巨人，并最终释放它。
I could fight you now, but, to be honest with you... I don’t want to take the risk. Don’t know what I’d do if I lost.
我现在可以和你战斗，但说实话...我不想冒险，我不知道如果输了会怎么做。
So I’ll wait at the heart of the new world and just watch it happen. Goodbye.
所以我会在新世界的中心等待，看着它发生，再见。
A bit of an anticlimax, I know.
有点令人失望，我知道。
...Sorry. I do like you. But I have to protect my own future.
...对不起，我喜欢你，但我必须保护自身的未来。
Yes, always. Motivated by fear. Forever.

...或许等我工作完成，就可以在权力的位置上安心地休息了。
You think I’d toss away my only chance at real happiness for you? Don’t delude yourself.
你认为我会为了你放弃我唯一的真正幸福的机会吗？别自欺欺人了。
Besides, if you were going to change my mind... you know the only language I speak.
而且，如果你想改变我的想法...你知道我唯一会说的语言。
...No, I guess it wouldn’t to you. You’ll carve a path anyways, won’t you?
...不，我猜你不会这样...你无论如何都会开辟一条道路，我没猜错吧？
Well, I’ll make sure it’s paved with thorns.
好吧，我会确保它铺满荆棘。
Regigigas, the future... the past... is quickly approaching.

I gotta see some of that myself.

I'm always ready to go, boss, you think you can show up?

Must be the nerves, eh? I get that, can't always be on your A-game.

You look the type that's going places, yeah?
看起来你的确是1个有前途的新人。
Gonna want to meet this guy if you're trying to do that.
如果你想要获得更进一步的成功，就得见见这个家伙。
He's a bit on the wild side but that ain't anything new for you, I bet. I'm sure you two will get along well.
他有些野蛮，但这对你来说应该不难，我相信你们能相处得很好。
Well, no use hanging around here. Already got all the workout I needed for the day.
好吧，今天的锻炼就到这里了，是时候回去了。
I'll try to catch you around, yeah? If not, well, have a great career I guess.
我会尽量来找你的，好吗？如果不行的话，那就祝你事业顺利吧。

So, we know where they're all going.
所以，我们知道他们都去哪儿了。
But there's something important we still don't know.

In your time exploring the Oasis System, please tell me you figured out what the purpose of the place is.

To help me FIGURE THIS OUT!

哎呀。
What were you even doing in there?

You're just like the others.

I really gotta stop using that opening when stopping people for inspections...
这个开场白太尴尬了，以后必须得换1个...
No, I didn't want to battle you. Here's my badge. We heard that there was suspicious activity here.
诶呀，我不想和你战斗，这是我的证件，我们听说这附近有可疑活动。
You see any crime lately?
你看到什么犯罪活动了吗？
No? Hmm, suspicious.

I lost my glasses! Here, my Pokemon can help us find them!

I still can't find my glasses...

[Map317]
*sniff*
*轻笑声*
Smell that? Smells like nerd in here.
闻到了吗？这里有一股书呆子的味道。
You ready kid? I'm gonna dunk you into the next decade.
准备好了吗，小鬼？我要把你扣进下1个十年。
Damn it! I lost to this brat? Really?!
玛德，我竟然输给了这个小鬼...
Hey, kid.
嘿，小鬼。
Listen, I’m not gonna lie and say I wasn’t planning this.
我不会骗你说，从来没有计划成为冠军。
I came here to become Champion, and so did you.
我们的目标在某些方面就是一样的。
Had to end this way, honestly. But, uh, either way this goes… I don’t really care.
就此结束也是必然，不过，我并不怎么在乎结果。
I just want to know. Get some closure.
我只是想...得到解脱。
Heh. Yeah? Finally catching on to the fact that this entire thing is idiocy?
哦，是吗？你终于意识到整件事的荒谬了？
Sorry – I’m still an asshole.
但，抱歉...我依然是个混蛋。
And that’s your right. It’s your life, and, well, more than one way to skin a Liepard.
那是你的权利，是你的选择与生活，而且，有很多解决问题的方法。
I promise I’ll give you a fight worth the title.
我会确保今天，给你一场值得称赞的战斗。
Wouldn’t want you to. This isn’t a practice match.
我也不希望你放水，这不是一场无关紧要的练习。
This is the real thing. I’m going to enjoy it.
这或许是最为关键的一场，而且，我会享受这个过程。
Oh, no, we do.
为什么？打还是要打的。
It’s fun. It’s fun and it’s a way to wrap this whole thing up. Closure’s stupid but it’s important.
这是整件事中最有趣的部分，也是结束一切的必要一环。
…I know Mavis is going to be watching our duel. Makes me a little sick.
而且...我知道梅维斯会看着我们这场决斗，这让我感觉有点恶心。
Don’t want it to be tainted by knowing I’m supposed to be "proving myself."
我不希望那些糟烂的争斗，玷污我想证明自身的决心。
Nothing for it, though. One last battle? I’m not going to lose this one like all the others.
但没办法，最后一战...我不会允许自身像之前那样输掉。
I’m going to lose it in my own way. Hah! Show me what you got, \PN. Show me who you are.
而是以我自身的方式“惜败”，哈哈，让我看看你的水准吧，\PN，向我展示真正的自身！
…It feels good to feel good after a loss.
...输完的感觉太棒了。
Congratulations. You’re the Champion. Pretty big achievement.
恭喜你，成为了冠军。这可是相当了不起的成就。
I know your job isn’t exactly over – I don’t have my head stuck in the sand.
我不是只知道埋头苦干的懵子，知道你还有其他事要处理。
As your rival and as your opponent, good game. You beat me fair and square. Great job.
但现在作为你的竞争者，还是先恭喜你公平公正地打倒了我。
As your brother, goodbye. I’m not gonna see you again for a little while.
接下来，作为兄弟，我估计得有段时间见不到彼此了。
I’m blocking Mavis on everything, picking a direction, and walking until I find something cool.
接下来我会在所有社交媒体上，屏蔽掉梅维斯，然后选择自身要走的方向。
Thanks. Good luck to you too.
谢谢，也祝你好运。
I’d stay, but I’ve got faith you’ve got this whole fiasco under control.
我当然也可以留下来做些什么，但我相信你已经有所准备了。
Gonna get a headstart on finding inner peace. Hah.
正好也乐得清净。
Don’t flatter me.
别夸我。
It’s irresponsible... but, yeah, I need some time away.
硬说起来还是挺不负责任的...只是，我确实需要一些时间。
I hope you can do the same, honestly.
我希望你偶尔也试试。
Get away from Mavis, from the gyms, everything. It’d do you good.
远离梅维斯，远离道馆，远离这些给你压力的一切，或许能让你感觉好得多。
Can’t change my mind, kid.
我不会改主意的，小鬼。
Screw Mavis. Screw the company. Screw the gyms, screw the Championship, screw Makya.
特么的梅维斯，特么的公司，特么的道馆，特么的锦标赛，特么的马凯亚！
Gonna go find out what I’m actually interested in, 'stead of just trying to one-up you for mommy. But thanks for the concern.
我要去找自身真正感兴趣的东西了，而不是为了让妈妈高兴，而试图超越你，总之还是谢谢你的关心。
Don’t. Seriously.
别这样。
I know she’s our mom, but she’s the reason we’ve been at each other’s throats. Or, uh, I’ve been at yours.
我知道她是我们的妈妈，但她就是我们一直相互敌视的原因，起码是我敌视你的原因。
I’m getting away from her. She wants to talk, she can start by not pitting us against each other.
所以我会离开她，等她什么时候意识到错误了，我也不会不给她机会。
…It is what it is, you know?
大概...就这样吧。
You need me, you call, alright? I’ll pick up for you.
如果你需要我帮忙了，就直接给我打电话吧，你的电话我还是会接的。
Congratulations, Champion. Love ya. Go be a hero and kick some ass.
总之，恭喜你冠军，爱来自你的哥哥，去当你的英雄吧，然后去踢某些人的屁股。
I had assumed we'd meet later in the Tournament, to be honest.
我本以为我们会在比赛后相遇。
Oh well, no use worrying about the seeding now. Just need to focus on the battle.
也好，这样就不用再考虑那么多，只要专注于战斗就可以了。
I'm going all in. Be ready.
我会全力以赴的，准备好了吗？
Hmm, a disappointing result. Seems like I won't be the first repeat champion.
嗯，还是有点失望，看来我不能成为第一位双冠王了。
Best of luck, it'll feel better to lose to the person who takes it all.
继续加油哦，如果是输给了最后的胜者好像也不差。
How d'ya do? Surprised to see me?
嘿嘿，看到我很惊讶？
Well, I ain’t 'bout to let this opportunity pass me up.
我是不想放过这个机会啦。
Don’t much matter to me if the world’s endin'. C’mon. Let’s have us a grand ol’ fight.
对我来说，末不末日的无所谓，起码现在要来一场盛大的战斗！
How d'ya do? \PN?
啊，我知道你，\PN。
Heard a lot 'bout you. The name’s Alessa.
我叫阿莱莎，对你还算比较关注吧。
I’m a… call me an old friend of Yezera’s. Real interested to see if you’re as good as she claims.
我是...叶泽拉的老朋友，而且很想看看你是否像她说的那样厉害。
Ya ready?
准备好了吗？
Ain’t too surprised ‘bout that one. I tried my best, honest, but I ain’t your rival. Heh.
并不意外的结果，我尽力了，但仍不是你的对手。
Oughta leave you to Yez. Ah, well, I figure I might get a second shot at you.
我觉得你应该去跟叶泽拉来一场...到时候或许还会有下1次交手。
We’ll see, huh? I’ll be watchin’, kid.
会有那一天的，对吧小家伙。
So y'are good, aren'tcha?
所以你的确还不错。
Yezera ain’t much of a liar, but I figured maybe she got a li'l rusty.
叶泽拉从来都不会撒谎，不过或许有些生疏了。
Quite a team, kid. And quite a trainer they got. I’ll be watchin', kid. I’ll be watchin'.
出色的训练师还有优秀的团队，我会亲眼见证你接下来的表现，继续加油吧，小家伙。
Good day.
气色不错。
Did you not expect the Dreadnaught to be here?
没想到我会在这里？
I’ve competed in every Championship since their inception. I wasn’t about to miss this one, avatars or no.
自从锦标赛开办以来，我每年都会参加比赛，不管有没有化身的威胁，我都不会错过这种盛会。
I want to face you. And now I can.
而且我也想和你再次交手。
It brings a smile to my face… though now that must be snuffed out, and my mind set… on the fight to come…
这让我有种很兴奋得感觉...不过现在得把这种情绪收起来，将思维集中在即将到来的对战上了...
…Hmm. I lost. I don’t know why I expected to win so shortly after our last match.
...嗯，我输了。毕竟距离我们上次交手也没多久，想就此战胜你未免有点异想天开了。
Ah well! It was fun while it lasted, and it was good to see you again.
好吧，虽然时间不长，但玩得很高兴。
In a way, I’m glad I lost so decisively. If I’d become Champion, the hassle of dealing with the gym would be a nightmare!
不过，从另1个角度来说，输掉对我来说也是好事，如果成为冠军还要同时处理道馆绝对是一场噩梦！
Goodbye, \PN. Come talk to me again sometime, though. My door is always open.
再见，\PN。有时间再来找我聊天，我家的门永远为你敞开着。
Oh, hey. I didn’t think I’d get this far. I didn’t think – well, didn’t think a lot of things.
我从没想过能走到今天这一步，我还没...还有很多事没准备好。
Doesn’t matter now. Win or lose, I’m ready to face you.
现在无所谓了，无论输赢，我都要面对你了。
And, uh, I’m looking forward to seeing you give 100%. Let’s go.
我希望你也能全力以赴，现在开始吧。
Yo. I’m Eifion. You’re, uh, \PN, yeah?
你好，我是艾维恩。你是，嗯...\PN，对吧？
The kid who’s been running errands for Tamarind? Heard you’re, uh, pretty scary.
就是你在帮塔玛琳跑腿？我听说你很可怕。
About half the trainers I talk to have lost to you at some point or another.
我聊过天的训练师当中，一半以上都输给过你。
... I, uh, don’t plan on being one of them.
...嗯，我不打算成为其中之一。
Damn!
该死！
I – I gave my best. My team did too. All I can ask for.
我...我尽力了...这已经是我的全力了。
You too, you know? You’re doing great. Really impressive. I’ll, uh, I’ll try again next year.
你做得真的很出色，回头我会再挑战你1次的。
If there is one next year. Gonna be rooting for you anyhow.
如果有这个机会的话...但现在，我会为你加油。
Huh. Well, I see why you’ve got so many notches on your Poké Balls.
我想这就是你的精灵球上，有那么多划痕的原因了。
Somebody’s gonna humble you one day. Looking forward to seeing that – but I’m gonna root for you until then.
总有一天会有人让你学会谦逊，但现在我会为你加油。
I like an underdog story, but I also like betting on the winning horse. G’luck, \PN.
我喜欢看到弱者爆冷，但也同时喜欢在高手身上下注，总之，祝你好运，\PN。
Figured I’d be seein’ you again. It’s been a little while, hasn’t it?
我就知道会有这么一天，距离上1次交手已经有段时间了。
Seems like just yesterday you were showing up and showing down with me on Casaba.
虽然感觉起来仿佛还是昨天，好像你离开甜瓜岛也没多久。
I’m not about to go down so easy a second time.
总之，我不会轻易倒下的。
You ready? I am.
你准备好了吗？我可早就准备好了。
Heh. Guess I never should’ve figured I could beat you.
哈哈，其实我从没想过能赢。
I’ll be rooting for you, kid.
我会为你加油的，孩子。
Shouldn’t call you kid, I guess. Barely recognize you, honestly.
也许不应该叫你孩子，毕竟，你已经成长到我快要认不出的地步了。
Good luck. Even though I doubt you’ll need it.
祝你在接下来的比赛中好运。
Oh, well, look what the Shinx dragged in. \PN.
哦，看看谁来了，\PN。
Eight years ago, I lost to Yezera, and because of that Team Chasm fell.
八年前，我输给了叶泽拉，并因此导致了裂隙队的覆灭。
I’ve been training since then. I’m planning on redeeming myself among the scattered remnants of your team.
从那时起，我便一直努力训练，并试图在与你的对战中，找回自身的失去的一切。
Nothing personal – I actually rather appreciate you. You’re just the most convenient point of comparison.
我没有人身攻击的意思...实际上我很欣赏你，只是将你作为目标比较方便罢了。
Now, let’s see if I can’t snuff out this child’s hopes and dreams.
现在，让我们看看我能不能就此扼杀这个孩子的希望和梦想。
*sigh* I’ll need to see my dentist. I think I lost an inch of enamel to grinding my teeth that hard.
唉，我得找时间去看看牙医了，刚才的局面让我磨掉了一毫米的牙釉质。
What is it about you that makes you so infuriatingly adaptable?
你到底是怎么做到这种程度的？
Fine. Fine! I’ll resign myself to the only thing I’m good at.
算了，习惯了，反正我还有其他擅长的事。
I’ll turn this region into an economic powerhouse, become even richer than Mavis, and buy LuxTech out from under her.
我会让马凯亚的经济腾飞，我终究会比梅维斯更富有，买下她手中所有的光华股份。
Enjoy my petty revenge. And good luck with the Championship or whatever. I’m done here.
就当是我小小的复仇吧，希望你接下来的比赛也能好好发挥，现在，我该就此退场了。
Hello! Hale and hearty, I hope?
嘿，最近怎么样？
Oh, rest easy, I have no interest in the title. No, I am here because a champion is in the making, and they must be tested!
哦，你放心，我对冠军头衔没什么兴趣。只是作为必要的一关，来这里见证冠军崛起而已。
Tested with fire! Tested with toxin! Tested with the unyielding agony that only the truest champion can withstand!
准备好应对火与毒的考验了吗？通过这场只有真正的冠军，才能承受下来的痛苦考验！
Now embrace it, and show me your worth!
那就去拥抱痛苦吧，展现你的实力与价值！
Blazing, brilliant, bearing both mercy and ruthlessness in equal measure!
炽热、辉煌，同时还包含着仁慈和无情的性情！
Ah ha ha! I’ll bow out now – now the role of the testing solvent belongs to you alone.
啊哈哈！我该退场了，后面还有其他的考验等着你。
Enjoy it! Revel in it! I’ll be cheering for you.
好好享受吧！尽情沉浸其中吧！我会为你加油的。
Oh, it’s you! I’ve been waiting for this fight.
哦，是你啊！我一直在等待这场战斗。
You would not BELIEVE the time I put into training after you got our badge!
你想象不到我在你拿到徽章后，花了多少时间在训练上！
If you’re thinking I’m just another rando, think again. Zoé and I got trained by Yezera herself back when it was her gym!
不要觉得我只是个普通人，我和佐伊都曾在叶泽拉的道馆接受她的训练。
Then I doubled down and went extra hard on training after you showed up. You are NOT prepared!
至于上次的失利，只是因为我还没准备好！
You WERE prepared! Wow!
还是你准备得更充分！
That was… uh… yeah! Still got a long ways to go, I guess! Wow!
唉...呃...也对，我还有很长的路要走。
I’ll remember that one for a long time to come, lemme tell you. Gonna keep training, keep moving, keep working my way up the ladder.
我会记住这两场战斗，会继续翻倍努力地训练，继续前进，继续向着更高爬去。
Glad to see you. Keep rocking, 'kay? Can’t wait for the rematch!
总之，继续加油吧，期待我们下1次的比试！
Same here.
我也是
Oh, I care.
我要赢
Won't go easy on you.
我不会手下留情
We don't have to fight.
我们未必要打
Good luck.
祝你好运
Good idea.
好主意
Don't.
别这样
Mavis...

The battles that take place each year are nothing short of inspirational!
每年，这里的对决都令人感到振奋！
I may be a painter, but battling is my second form of art!
我是1个画家，同时也是战斗的艺术家！
Fantastic! Marvelous! Outstanding!
太棒了！简直难以置信！
Your style is so graceful, so forceful, so majestic! You deserve the title of champion!
你的风格是如此优雅，如此雄壮有力，你无愧于冠军的称号！
Nothing like a warmup scrim before the next round!
在下一轮比试前，最好热一下身！
I've done what I set out to do: defeat every gym leader without losing a single 'mon, and never using any held items.
我已经完成那个了我的目标：在没有精灵被打倒的情况下，战胜了所有道馆馆主，而且还没有携带任何物品。
So, I guess I can't be too mad about scrubbing out in the very first round of the tournament...
所以...我不应该因为第一轮就被淘汰，而感到太难过
I heard you got a first-round bye, and were seeded in the opposite bracket from mine.
我听说你被分到和我不同的小组了。
Means you'll get to avoid the guy who ended up sweeping me with his Serperior.
也就说你不会很快遇到那个用君主蛇横扫了我的人。
He kind of reminded me of you, actually.
实际上，他让我想起了你。
Anyways, I got time and I got frustration to vent. Battle me if you find yourself in the same situation.
总之，我现在有时间了，而且也想发泄一下挫败感。如果你需要训练的话，可以来找我。
Any fights between us now are just for the joy of battling. That persuasive enough, heh?
我们之间的所有对决，都只是为了纯粹的对战的乐趣，没错吧？
Understood.
明白了。
I'll be here until you wish to battle.
我会在这里等你的。
My redemption is imminent. Surely.
当然，我的救赎之道，或许就在其中。
Yeah, you're definitely like that guy I fought.
没错，你跟那个人很像。
Results were just as expected. I'm just happy it wasn't too lopsided.
预料之中的结果，好在没有被一边倒的打倒。
There's a nurse down there in the main lobby.
下面的大厅里有个护士。
Hop on down there, and right back up to me so we can fight again, you hear?
下去，然后再回来，这样我们就可以再来一场了。
Golly gee, if it isn't the Champion of Makya.
哦吼，这不是马凯亚冠军吗？
I had great seats for watching that final battle.
我的座位位置还不错，能看到最后的战斗。
That dingus was related to you, after all!
而且你跟那个家伙是亲戚！
Quite a fight. The energy in the crowd was electric.
你们打得相当精彩，观众们都沸腾起来了。
Frankly I'm honored to have seen your illustrious victory in person!
说实话，我很荣幸能亲眼目睹你的辉煌胜利！
I'm going to take a break from traveling the region, and stick around here for a while.
我现在打算暂停自身的旅行，在这里住一段时间。
A couple of battles won't hurt, though. I'll be right here, if the desire strikes you.
如果你想的话，有空来打几场也行，我就在这里。
I even tweaked my team a little!
我甚至还稍微调整了一下我的队伍！
Champion, eh? I hope you don't feel above battling little 'ol me.
冠军？我不会觉得跟这个头衔的人交手有什么了不起的。
Wait. If I beat you now, do I become champion instead?
等下，如果我打赢了你，那我是不是就是冠军了？
That was a champion-tier victory, all right!
这是一场冠军级别的胜利！
If you still feel the need to prove yourself, the previous champions are all still in Makya.
如果你觉得有必要继续证明自身，以前的冠军们也都还在马凯亚。
Fighting them would be fun, I bet!
我觉得，跟他们打一打一定很有趣！
I avoided worrying about the Avatar Crisis during my gym challlenge. I don't think my skill set transfers too well to fighting them.
我一直投身于道馆挑战，也因此避免了跟化身危机的交集，而且我也不太适合跟它们战斗。
But I'm worried now, though.
所以我现在有些担心。
I bet people'll be falling over themselves to give you healing items, now.
我觉得现在会有很多人，争先恐后地送给你东西。
Not me, though, I still gotta do things the old fashioned way. I'll need time to do that, if you don't mind.
但我不会这么做，还是得按老办法来。你不介意的话，稍微给我点时间。
\PN, eh? How do ya spell that?
我不想再像前八年那样刻字了，
Don't want to have to redo the engraving like 8 years ago.
\PN你觉得行吗？

也许明年我们能走得更远，我可以的。
I've learned a thing or two watching you battle. It was so eye-opening!
看了你们的战斗，我学到了很多东西！
Next year, I know I can at least make it to the semi- finals!
明年，我觉得至少能进半决赛！
The Mightyena is too focused on battling to notice you.
大狼犬心思都在战斗中，根本没注意到你。
For security reasons, this ticketing gate is closed.
出于安全考虑，此检票通道已关闭。
Even for a newly-minted champion.
即便是新晋冠军也不例外。
I hope no funky business goes down during the competition.
我希望锦标赛期间，不要再出什么幺蛾子了。
Outside of that weird quake, it was business as usual.
除了那奇怪的震感之外，一切正常。
Another successful day of guard duty.
又是和平的一天。
Me and my Pokemon might be at a disadvantage since the Tournament is only single battles.
锦标赛之中只有单打模式，我和我的精灵可能会吃亏。
It matters not! We will fight through with pure determination!

My old rival once set up his sweeper even though I had no chance to recover.
我的老对手曾在我毫无准备的时候，将我在赛场外横扫出局了。
"Why did you set up on me?" I asked, "I was already walled."
“你干嘛，诶哟？”我问他，“我还没准备好！”
My rival smiled, "You were swept before the game started; the set up is the whole point."
他只是笑着说：“在比赛开始前你就没有资格了，准备工作才是重中之重。”
One night while meditating, I was approached by a Chasm grunt who demanded my possessions: my items, my Pokemon, the shirt off my back.
那天晚上，我正在冥想，1个裂隙队的人过来，索要财物，把我的物品、精灵和衣服都抢走了。
I quickly complied. Now naked and cold, I resumed meditation.
我并没有反抗他，而是赤身裸体，继续冥想。
"My poor fellow," I said to myself, "I wish I could give you my skill, too."
“的确我现在失去了财富”，我对自身这样说，“但他抢不走我的技术。”
My old rival predicted my every swap until I became afraid to pivot.
我的老对手每次都能猜中，我要换哪只精灵。
"How do you guess correctly every time?" I asked.
“为什么你总能猜到？”我问他。
My old rival smiled. "I limit your options until you have only one choice," my rival replied.
他笑着回答道：“我会限制你的可选项，当你只有1个选项可行时，
"And then you have no choice at all."
这个选择就是必然。”
"Why do you play worse the closer you get to the finish line?" my old rival asked.
“为什么你越接近终点时，发挥得越差呢？”我的老对手这么问我。
I thought for a moment and replied, "because I'm afraid to lose."
我想了一会儿，答道：“因为我害怕失败。”
My old rival smiled. "Are you sure you're not afraid to win?"
他笑着问我：“那你就不怕赢吗？”
I met my old rival at a petting zoo. He was talking with one of the baby Skiddo and struggling to hold back tears.
那次我在宠物园区遇到了我的老对手，他正努力忍着眼泪，跟一只小坐骑山羊说话。
I asked him, "are you doing okay, friend?"
我问他：“你还好吗，伙计？”
He shook his head solemnly. "Everyone forgets that goats are herd animals. We're not meant to be alone."
他郑重地摇了摇头：“大家都忘了山羊是群居动物，我们注定不会孤独。”
"I'm playing terribly," I told my old rival. "I'm not going to win."
“我表现得很差，”我对他说，“我赢不了...”

Do you understand yet? Can you see it within my eyes – the reflection of what I have borne witness to?
你明白了？你能从我的眼中看到吗...我所见证的一切的倒影？
At first I journeyed here not knowing why, or what I hoped to find. I simply knew I must.
起初，我并不知道为什么来到这里，或者我希望能找到什么，只是知道我必须来。
And then... then it fell upon me like some grim scavenger upon a fresh corpse.

I do not know if I ever did. Countless possibilities plagued me in sleepless hours.
我不确定自身是否曾经想过这种可能性，在我失眠的时候，有太多想法一直困扰着我。
Was this one too elegant to consider? Or too cruel?
还是说觉得这个结局...太过优雅，或者太过残忍，所以不愿意去考虑？

I need your support, and I know your adamant core resides within your abilities as a trainer.

更重要的是，我知道这是你评判人的方式，我想让你见证我的灵魂，获知真相。
Do what you must. I may wait a few moments longer... may keep the past at bay.

I remember the house, the old hardwood, the ticking of the grandfather clock, the smell of the river loam!
我想起了那栋房子，那些古老的硬木地板，那座老爷钟的滴答声，那河边泥土的气味！
The crushing of the drying autumn leaves, the warmth of a soft embrace, the bruising, the bleeding, the burning, the fight!

I remember her. I remember Imogene teaching us, teaching all of us... teaching us to be...
我想起她了，我记得伊莫珍教导我们，教导我们大家...教导我们成为...

The name on this gravestone is faded beyond recognition...

Leave me. I must do this alone.
让我1个人离开吧。
There’s a note.

“I’ve released them. Our Pokémon go readily. I think they know. As for me... I remember. She loved Dittos. She kept dozens.

她不仅训练它们参加战斗，还训练它们模仿人类，模仿...她自身。
I found it so curious, to see Pokémon pretending to be people. How lovely. How fun!
我觉得很奇妙，看到精灵假装成人类，多么可爱，多么有趣！
She took me in as if I was just another pink blob, and she taught me more than I can express, let alone repay.
她像对待我的方式，也像对待她们一样，她教给我很多东西，我无法一一列举，更无以为报。
I am not her, nor is my companion. We are but two mirrors set facing each other, endlessly reflecting a woman that is gone.
我不是她，我的姐妹也不是...我们只是两面镜子，不停地照出1个已经离去的女人。
We strayed further and further in our imitations every day. It could not last. Do not mourn for us.
我们每天都在越来越远的模仿中迷失自身，这本就不能永远持续下去，不要为我们而感到悲伤。
This is the truth, and it provides suffering and succor in equal measure, as it always does.
这就是真相，它带来了同等的痛苦和安慰，一如既往。
We are released from our bonds. We are Imogene no longer.
我们不再受到束缚，我们不再是伊莫珍。
Now we are Imogene, sisters of a name, and that is all.
但我们又都是伊莫珍，同名的姐妹，仅此而已。
Thank you.
谢谢。
Goodbye.
再见。
P.S.: I have done things I should not have, in pursuit of this truth. I have endeavored to cause harm to you, to others, to the world entire.

它就等在这里，活生生地出现在面前。
It chitters happily, swimming through the air.
它欢快地吟唱着歌谣，在空中游曳。
Yet, somehow, there’s a macabre tinge to its movements, a slight touch of gallows humor to the way it darts around gravestones.

你知道它可以随时离开，但它不会不辞而别。
It flips upside down, then rights itself in mid-air.
它翻转过来，然后在半空中恢复了平衡。
Perhaps mockery, perhaps a nod, perhaps just an idle motion of a recently-freed animal.

A mirage that disappears with a strong breeze, dispelled like a waking dream.

我的名字是小蕾，但我的战力可不像1个花蕾...
I'm the 28th Bud Hill, a long lineage of gardeners that have maintained the Floral Maze.
我是第28任“峰之花蕾”，是守护鲜花迷宫的园丁！
It may not look like much, but this is one of the longest maintained structures in all of Makya.
虽然看起来不怎么起眼，但这里是整个马凯亚存留时间最久的人类造物。
I've been wandering for hours. If I don't find the exit soon, my skin will dry out!
我已经转了好几个小时了，如果不能尽快找到出口，我的皮肤会枯萎的！
I feel very Croagunk-esque right now...
我感觉自身要变成不良蛙了...
I must have some moisturizer on me somewhere...
身上还有一点保湿露...
A map would have been nice to have...
如果有地图就好了...
[Map334]
Oh?
嗯？
They’ll come with me. I couldn’t convince them to stay even if I wanted to.
他们会跟我一起走，即使我想让他们留下，也说不服他们。
They’ll keep me safe, I know that much.
他们会保护我的，我知道...
I imagine Artemisia and the rest have given you plenty of trouble before – you know how much they love me.
蒿蒿他们以前...肯定给大家带来了很多麻烦...你知道他们有多爱我。
They’re the best Pokémon anyone could ask for.
他们是任何人都想要的最好的精灵。
They’re used to me disappearing. At least this time I have a good reason.
他们已经习惯了我突然消失，至少这次我有1个很好的理由。
My mom will worry, but she knows I can take care of myself.
我妈妈会担心...但她知道我能照顾好自身。
Alessa... she’ll be the first person I talk to when I get back. I miss her already.
阿莱莎...她会是我回来后第1个说话的人...我已经有点想她了。
But she’s used to it. She’s a better friend than I deserve.
但她已经习惯了，她是我应得的好朋友。
No. I can’t.
不，我不能。
Consider this my exile, or my recovery, or my finding myself. However you need to frame it.
把这看作是我的流放...或者我的康复...或者我的自我发现...不管你怎样说都好。
Sometimes I just... need to disappear. And I can’t think of a better place to disappear.
有时候我只是需要消失...而我想不到1个更好的方法来消失了。
Like I said – I’ll return. This wasn’t our last battle.
就像我说的...我会回来的，这不是我们的最后一战。
Oh, \PN. You’re going to make me cry again. Don’t – don’t make me cry again.
哦，\PN。你又要让我哭了，不要...不要让我再哭了。
...I love you. I don’t mean that in any certain way, I just... I love you.
...我爱你。我...并没有什么其他的含义，只是...我爱你。
Thank you. Awww, \PN. I’m crying. *sniff*
谢谢，啊...\PN...我又哭了...*抽泣*
Are you ready to go?
你准备好了吗？
Your Pokémon...?
你的精灵？
Your friends...?
你的朋友？
Please stay.
请留下来。
Hug her.
拥抱她。
Not yet.
还没有。
Yeah.
是的。

The people upstairs don't know jack.
楼上的人什么都不懂。
The real sauna is right here at the source.
真正的桑拿就在这里。
Sitting in the water, I'm safe from all the wild Pokemon.
坐在这些水中，也不用担心被野生精灵打扰。
I help manage the wildlife down here.
我负责管理这里的生态系统。
The sauna's heating is actually an ecosystem in and of itself.
来确保全天然桑拿的稳定运行。
The Pokemon here feed on grass and minerals.
即便这里的精灵都以草或者矿物质为食。
We occasionally have to tamper-- a shipment of food here or catching a few Pokemon there...
也需要我们偶尔干预一下，运送一些食物或捉走部分精灵...
But it's surprisingly low cost.
怎么说也比人工桑拿成本低。

A locked door. It has a slot for a keycard.

However, it no longer holds any drinks.

[Map339]
[Map340]
Are you ready?
你准备好了吗？
You arrive even here undeterred… but not unforeseen.
即便到现在都无法阻止你...当然我也不是没有料到。
You have heeded Yezera’s invitation even should it bring you into the most dismal abysm of this entire region.
你接受了叶泽拉的邀请，即便这会把你带到这个地区最凄凉的深渊。
Do you fancy yourself a hero? Do you bear a grudge? Or are you enamored with the idea of facing a former Champion?
你认为自身是英雄吗？还是对某些事情怀恨在心？或者只是想要面对一位前冠军？
Pray, do not tell me. I would delight in divining the answer myself.
请不要告诉我，我更愿意自身猜出答案。
I fear I must. Yezera may have invited you, but I extended no such hospitality.
我恐怕必须告诉你，虽然叶泽拉邀请了你，但我并不会向你提供的款待。
You two may have your rendezvous in a world of primordial truth.
你们2个可以在1个原始真理的世界里会面。
Now, allow me to peer into your heart.
现在，让我窥探你的内心。
I shan’t allow you to continue a step further. A world unveiled by mortal deception awaits me.
我不会让你再往前走一步，1个揭示骗局的世界正等着我。
I will not permit you to deny me my enlightenment.
我不会允许你否认我得到启迪的权利。
Shall we commence with the inevitable? I grow weary of waiting.
我们开始不可避免的战斗吧，我等得有些厌倦了。
The hearts and minds of humans are trivial to decipher – with my acumen, at least.
人类的心灵，至少对于我的敏锐来说，是微不足道的。
Even discounting my auguries, the soul of a true Trainer is laid bare in battle.
即使不考虑我的占卜，1个训练师的灵魂也会在战斗中裸露出来。
Show me what passion drives you, hero.
向我展示你的激情吧，英雄。
Do you take my idiolect for the mark of pretension?
你认为我说话的方式是虚伪的标志吗？
As you please. Dismiss my words as insipid or overwrought as you wish – I have no need to converse with you any longer.
随你便吧，你可以把我的话视为乏味或者过度，我也不再需要与你交谈。
Shall we speak in your native tongue? I am more than fluent.
用你最能听懂的语言吧？恰好，我也很擅长这个。
You’re late, kid. Ain’t got no manners, keepin' a lady waitin' like that.
你迟到了，小家伙。让女士等待很没礼貌。
Hah! Ain’t talkin' 'bout myself – meant Yez.
哈！我说的女士不是自身，而是叶泽拉。
Don'tcha gimme that smile. She’s right fine when she’s dolled up, and more than that, she’s my friend.
收起你这份笑意，她打扮得好的时候很好看，而且她是我的朋友。
You’re gonna give her your respect, y'hear me?
她应当被尊重，明白？
Now, got some bad news for ya: I ain’t lettin' you have your last dance with her if I can help it. This ends now.
现在，我有些坏消息告诉你：如果我能阻止的话，我不会让你和她最后起舞，到这里就结束了。
Glad to hear ya hearin' me. Now, kid, I ain’t 'bout to pull any punches.
很高兴你愿意听我讲话，但现在，我不会手下留情的。
'Cause you’re sweet and oh-so-polite, I ain’t gonna break anything.
不过，因为你的礼貌，我不会打伤你。
But you’re pickin’ a fight with Yez, so I’m gonna leave you with some bruises. You 'bout ready? Put ‘em up, kid.
但你毕竟在阻挠叶泽拉，那就留下一些淤青吧。准备好了吗？放马过来吧。
Ah, you’re such a babyface. Real cute one, too.
啊，你的脸真的很和我的胃口。
Kinda kid you take home to meet your parents, y’know? Shame I’m gonna have to put you six feet under.
我挺想把你带回去见父母的，但现在我得让你下地狱。
Hah! I kid, I kid – I ain’t doin’ wetwork. Anymore.
哈哈！我开玩笑的，我不会再做得那么极端了。
I ain’t lettin’ you get away without a few bruises, though. Ready? Go!
但是我也不会让你毫发无损地离开，准备好了吗？
Hey – listen, she’s – don’tcha try goin’ and flusterin’ me.
你...听着，她...别让我分神。
Had to haul that girl to prom, mind ya, and she wears a nice dress a mite better than yours truly.
每次不得不带她去舞会时...她穿上礼服都比我好看多了。
My point is that’s she’s a right fine lady, and ya better respect her like one.
总之，要把她当做女孩子看待，像对待一位女士一样尊重她。
Agh, ya got me distracted. Quit with the psyops and fight me proper.
啊，我不该分心想这些...别用心理战术了，跟我好好打。
Hah! Whatever you say, kid. I ain’t 'bout to take that metaphor and run with it.
哈！随你怎么说，我只不过是做个比喻罢了。
You want to get to her, ya go through me. Call me cliche but that’s my line about it.
你想接近她，就得先过我这关，虽然老套，但这就是我的底线。
I guess ya could say I’m reserving the first dance. Hah!
你也可以说，我是在准备序曲，哈哈！
I like you, kid. C’mere. Lemme beat that humor out of you.
说实话我挺喜欢你的，但现在得把你的幽默打出来了。
Hello there. You arrived just a teensy bit earlier than I expected – I was writing a poem, see. Never to be finished, tragically.
你好，你来得...比我预期中要早一些...我正在写一首诗，可惜永远无法完成了。
These black arches of stone like a starless sky will soon be replaced by brilliant alabaster, which, well, ruins the central symbolism.
这黑色的拱门像是没有星星的夜空，很快就要被华丽的雪花石膏所代替，可这却破坏了中心的象征意义。
What a shame. I assume you’re going to force me to duel you now?
真可惜，我猜...你现在要逼我跟你决斗了吧？
You march into my demesne, hauling your well- trained combat creatures with you.
你闯进我的领地，带着你训练有素的战斗宠物。
We’ve fought before. You’re completely opposed to my beautiful dream. And you still want to claim I have a choice in the matter?
我们以前就交过手了，你还反对我的美好梦想，我又怎么有选择的权力呢？
Don’t insult me. You’ve made your choice, and now we have to deal with the consequences.
不要侮辱我了。你已经做出了选择，现在我们必须承担相应的后果。
Ah, well. At least you’re honest. I like that about you. You’ve got such... clarity.
好吧，至少你很诚实，我喜欢你这一点，喜欢你如此清晰的思路。
What a gleaming light in this dreary cave. Why, that could almost be poetic! If only we had a hopeless romantic to write that down.
在这个阴暗的洞穴里，总有一束闪亮的光芒。这似乎也可以写成诗！如果我们能有1个陷入绝望的浪漫主义者来记录一切就好了。
Alas, I’ll be too busy directing my passions into carving your team apart.
唉，我不得不将我的激情投入到分化你的团队当中。
Of course! You’re such a brilliant spark in this region. You deserve odes... sonnets.
当然！你在这个地区是如此杰出的一束光，你应该得到颂歌...得到十四行诗。
On the other hand, the fact that you’re here now against me instead of alongside me means that you’re not as special as I thought.
另一方面，你现在站在我对面而不是和我并肩作战，这意味着你并不像我想象中那么特别。
No faith. It’s a shame, really! I don’t want to do this! But I will.
没有信仰，真是可惜！我不想这样做！但我必须要做。
And, since I have to... might as well enjoy it.
既然我这已经是定局...那就享受一下吧。
What? You think a poetic soul is creepy? Does true faith disturb you?
什么？你认为有诗意的灵魂很可怕吗？虔诚的信仰让你不安吗？
Genuine emotions uncompromised by the endless drudgery of society? Fine!
不被无休止的社会劳作所侵扰的真实情感让你感到不舒服了？
Enjoy where that narrow-minded view gets you. Namely: here, about to lose to me.
好吧，享受那种狭隘的看法吧。也就是说：你将在这里输给我。
Hello, friend.
你好，朋友。
We have already begun. Regigigas will quickly remake the world.
我们已经开始行动了，雷吉奇卡斯将很快重塑世界。
I understand that you are here to face Yezera, but unfortunately I can’t allow that.
我知道你来这里是为了见叶泽拉的，但很抱歉我不能允许。
There is a non-zero chance of your success, and I am not a gambler. If you would like, we can both stay here and talk until the reversion overtakes us.
你成功的概率接近于零，但我不是赌徒，不会选择放任。如果你愿意，我们可以一起待在这里，直到逆转影响到我们。
I supposed as much. Excuse me, but in that case I must fight you.
我也是这么觉得的。不好意思，但在现在这种情况，我必须和你战斗。
Universal knowledge is approaching. I would like to be there to witness it – alone, if possible.
真正的知识正在接近，我想在那里见证它...如果可能的话，我也想独自一人。
I do not either. Unfortunately, I can tell from your tone that we are, in fact, about to duel.
我也不想，不幸的是，我可以从你的语气中感觉到我们确实将要决斗。
I am unwilling to let you go further, and I am unwilling to lose. Please understand... and please consider conceding.
我不愿让你继续前进，也不愿输给你。请理解...并考虑认输吧。
That is the most I am willing to say pertaining to your odds against Yezera.
如果你要直面叶泽拉，这已经是保守的估计了。
She is conventionally regarded as unbeatable when she applies herself, though I am aware that you have broken that convention repeatedly.
只要她想，她就是无敌的，尽管我也听说了，你已经多次打破了惯例。
Now, may we end the discussion of theory and add another data point?
现在，我们可以结束理论讨论，再引入另一部分数据吗？
Excuse my verbosity. If you would like to go straight to our duel, we can.
请原谅我啰嗦，如果你想直接进行决斗，那就来吧。
I would not insult your intelligence by pretending we will not fight. That much should be evident.
我不会侮辱你的智慧，假装我们不会打架，那没有什么意义。
Shall we?
开始吧？
Oh, uh, hey. Listen: I’m gonna cut right to the chase.
哦...嗯...我直奔主题了。
You beat me once. You beat Yezera, um, a lot.
你曾经打败过我，也打败了叶泽拉，嗯...很多次。
Though, some of those don’t really count, 'cause she was using someone else’s team and – whatever.
虽然其中一些场次，因为她用了别人的队伍，或者其他什么原因而不能算数。
Point is, I can’t beat you. But… I gotta try. I’ve got a lot to answer for, y’know?
但问题是，我打不过你，也还是...必须尝试。我有很多问题要解决。
Lotta little things I did that I got to make up for. Can’t you just let me have this?
我必须去弥补自身曾经的过错，你就不能让我得到这个机会吗？
Of course you can’t. Can’t let me have anything, can you?
没错，我知道是这个答案，你什么都不会让给我。
Ugh, I was gonna be Champion! I was really gunning for it, too. And then... yeah. Everything.
我本来那么努力，就要成为冠军的！但是...没错，一切都玩了！
You completely overshadow me in every way. I can’t beat you. But I’m gonna try to hurt you.
你很多方面都超过我了，我打不过你，但我会用其他方式！
Maybe to you. But not to them – not to Pokémon. They’re the ones who have to forgive me.
对你来说可能是这样，但对它们来说不是...不是对精灵来说，是那些必须原谅我的人。
It’s time for them to stop taking orders and start being treated like equals. That includes from ace trainers like you.
是时候让他们不再接受命令，被平等对待了。这也包括像你这样的顶尖训练师。
I know you can’t stand that, so... I guess we gotta fight. Sorry... but I’m not sorry.
我知道你不能容忍这一点，所以...我想我们得打一架，抱歉...但我不后悔。
I don’t. Not most of the time anyways.
大多数时候我不会这样。
I’m trying my best to make things right. Can you say the same? Going around keeping the status quo?
我正在尽我最大的努力去改正曾经的错误，你敢说这样的话吗？你只是在维持现状。
Is this the world you want? I guess you’re a rich brat, so... yeah. Life’s easy, life’s good.
这是你想要的世界吗？你是个富家子弟，所以...没错，没有压力，生活美好。
Hmph. I’m gonna try and make it a little harder for you, if I can.
哼，如果可以的话，我会让你的生活变得更艰难一些。
Sorry. Guess I’m a spiteful bastard.
抱歉，或许我就是个恶毒的混蛋。
No! I’ll fail – I’ll gladly fail – but I’m not about to give up. I’ve got friends that need protecting.
不！我会失败的...我很乐意失败...但我不会放弃。我有需要保护的朋友。
I’ve got stuff in my past I need to make up for. And I’ve got a world that needs building.
我有需要去弥补的过去，有需要去建设的世界。
A better one – one that’s more equal, more fair. Sorry it isn’t what you want, but I won’t just roll over for you.
1个更好的世界...1个更加平等、公正的世界。对，这不是你想要的，但我不会因此而屈服。
You ready?
准备好了吗？
...Hey. So, uh, this is it, huh?
...嘿。这在这里了，对吧？
You’re, like, not gonna have a change of mind? No justice? No fairness? No punishment?
你不会...大概...改变主意对吗？忽略了正义、公平和惩罚？
Oh, who am I kidding – you’re Tamarind’s lapdog. You’ve been doing her dirty work since, like, literally day one!
呵，是我看走眼了...你就是塔玛琳的走狗，大概...从一开始就在为她做事！
Guess what that means! That’s right: time to pay!
你知道这意味着什么吗？没错：是时候付出代价了！
That’s what they all said. You’re not a team grunt! You’re just, like, a temporarily inconvenienced mastermind!
没错，他们也这么说，你不是这个团队的普通士兵，你...大概...是个...暂时失去权势的策划者！
Ugh, you’re all the same. Well, I’ve chewed through a lotta grunts. No different this time!
呵，你们都一样，我已经干掉了很多士兵了，这次也不会有有什么例外！
Nope! But I really really want to!
不，我真的真的很想打你！
Tamarind’s out of my reach, but you’re, like, the second-best thing. So c’mere so I can give you a bloody nose.
既然我打不到塔玛琳，那你就是最好的选择，过来让我揍你一顿。
If you were sorry you’d stop fighting me, idiot!
如果你真的抱歉，就别再继续了，白痴！
You’re such a – such a dolt! How can I get it through your thick skull that you’re the bad guy? Can I beat it into you? Wanna find out?
你真是个...蠢货！我怎么才能让你明白你是坏人？我能把这些打进你的脑袋里吗？
Oh, I swear, I’ll roll up these sleeves and deck you myself if I have to! I swear, if you chip my nails I’m gonna kill you for real!
如果必须的话，我会卷起袖子亲自揍你！如果弄坏了我的指甲，我甚至会杀了你！
C’mon, boys and girls! We’ve got a beatdown to give!
来吧，我的队友们！我们要打败他们！
Ah. Hah. Hahaha!
啊。哈，哈哈哈！
So be it! My reading is complete – the scars of this battle left in the ancient stone here are a portent of things to come.
就这样吧！预言已经完成了...这场战斗在这里留下的，这些古老石头上的伤痕，就是未来的预兆。
Can you suppose what it says? It says I shall lose here, and you shall triumph.
你能猜到它说了什么吗？它说我会失败，你会获胜。
Hah! Fate has a sense of humor, it seems.
哈！命运似乎有一种幽默感。
Go on. Continue yet deeper. I know my place, and will not stand against destiny any longer.
继续吧，去更深处。我知道我的位置，不会再违抗命运了。
For my sanity, I will refrain from attempting to divine the results of your future battles. I take my leave.
为了我的理智，我将不再尝试预测你未来战斗的结果。告辞。
Awww, kid, you shouldn’t have.
哦，你不该这样。
Goin’ all-out? On yours truly? I’m touched. Not even half-honest, either – it’s a treat seein’ you fight.
你对我全力以赴了？我觉得连一半都没有，你完全就是在享受战斗。
Go on. Yez is waitin’ for you. I ain’t too hung up on this whole scheme. Yez’ll turn out fine either way – tough girl.
继续吧，叶泽拉在等你，我对计划是否成功并不在意，无论结局如何，叶泽拉都会变成1个勇敢的女孩。
Tougher than me, I swear. So you go do what ya got planned, whatever that is.
一定...比我更坚强，所以你去做你计划中的事情吧，无论那是什么。
If ya hurt her, they’ll never find the body, blah blah blah, you know the drill.
还有如果你敢伤害她，尸体永远都不会被找到，吧啦吧啦吧啦，你知道我要说什么。
Good luck, kid. Come find me some time afterwards, y’hear?
祝你好运吧，之后再来找我。
...Go. Leave. Now, before I lose my temper.
...走吧，现在就走吧。在我发火之前走。
Is that really what the fate of the universe hangs on? Our relative skill in training Pokémon?
宇宙的命运真的取决于我们训练精灵的技能吗？
It’s ridiculous! It’s idiotic! I can’t believe – go! Just go! I should... I should... go.
这太荒谬了！太愚蠢了！我简直不敢相信...走！走！我应该...我应该...走！
Noted. Excuse me – I fear I may not have provided adequate resistance. I now find myself lacking any means to challenge you.
我知道了，请原谅我...我根本没有提供足够的力量，我发现自身没有任何挑战你的手段。
...Understood. I have no recourse but to retreat. I wish you the worst of luck in your future endeavors.
...明白了，我别无选择，只能撤退，祝你接下来厄运缠身。
If you will permit me to leave, I will no longer impede your progress.
如果你允许我离开，我不会再阻碍你的进展。
Goodbye, friend. I hope never to see you again.
再见...还是别再见的好。
Damn it. Damn it!
该死！该死！
I – yeah, that’s how it goes. Never was as good as you. Any of you hotshots.
我...对，就是这样。我从来不像你们那样厉害。
Pushed my Pokémon hard to try and get there, and now look at me. Trying to make up for all of it.
我努力训练我的精灵，试图达到那个水平，现在...试图弥补所有过错。
Sorry, everyone. Sorry, Manaphy. I guess that was it.
对不起，大家。对不起，玛纳霏。我想那就是结局了。
Let’s get y’all back to a Pokécenter, OK? Get you fixed up... I’m sorry...
让我们把你们送回精灵中心，好吗？让你们恢复过来...我很抱歉...
Ugh! I’m – fine! Ow. I think I took a stray shot... oof.
呃！我...没事！哎，我想我挨了一枪...
Look me in the damn eyes, you dumb grunt! If I was – ow – if I wasn’t... if I wasn’t... I’m feeling a little lightheaded.
看着我的眼睛，你这个愚蠢的家伙！如果我不是...呃...如果我不是...我...有点头晕...
Is this why they black out after losing...? I’m gonna... I can’t do this.
这就是他们输掉之后...会晕倒的原因吗？我...我要...我不行...
Go do whatever it is you think you’re, like, actually accomplishing. You stupid, stupid dolt...
你这个榆木脑袋...去做...大概...你想做的吧...
But you’re pickin’ a fight with Yez, so I’m gonna leave you with some bruises. You 'bout ready? Put 'em up, kid.
但你毕竟在阻挠叶泽拉，那就留下一些淤青吧。准备好了吗？放马过来吧。
You want to get to her, ya go through me. Call me cliché but that’s my line about it.
你想接近她，就得先过我这关，虽然老套，但这就是我的底线。
I should’ve known she was useless.
我早就该想到她没用了。
Yezera was THIS close. So close to getting everything she wanted. All she had to do was not tell you.
叶泽拉就差一点，就差一点，如果她没有告诉你，那就能得到一切了。
She had to not be human. Her one redeeming quality: her inhumanity. And now she went and betrayed that, and with it, me.
她就不该是人类，她唯一的可取之处，就是她身上非人性的成分。现在她背叛了它，也背叛了我。
Apparently. It’s sickening, to be honest.
外表上或许吧，但实际上有够恶心的。
The same shallow, stupid desires as everyone else. I guess I’m just as much of an idiot for believing in her.
和其他人一样，只有肤浅、愚蠢的欲望，我想我和她一样都是个白痴。
Yes. Good. For. Her.
对对对，很好。为她高兴。
Unfortunately, it isn’t so good for her grand plan, nor mine. I hope the catharsis is worth it.
但这无论是对她的，还是我的计划都不是好事，希望这种宣泄是值得的。
Yes, she did. I’m glad you’ve realized that.
是的，她做到了，我很高兴你能意识到这一点。
Fine. I hope I never see you again.
好吧，希望永远不会再见到你。
But, well, I’ll take care of her once the regression is complete.
但是，结束之后，我会照顾她的。
You, on the other hand, I’ll deal with now. So long.
但你，我现在就得处理掉，就这样再见吧。
Do you want me to dispose of your team again? Go on ahead. I can delay you all day.
想让我再处理你1次吗？来吧，想多少次都可以。
No!
不！
I want it! I want it so badly!
我需要它！我非常需要它！
I’d – you don’t understand. You don’t understand at all.
我会...你不明白，你什么都不明白。
How sickened I am at you creatures.
你们这些生物让我感到恶心。
Fine. You win. Go rendezvous with Yezera.
好吧，你赢了。去和叶泽拉会合吧。
I hope she puts you in your place.
我希望她能让你明白自身的位置。
If you ever see me again, it won’t end well for one of us.
如果再见面，对我们谁来说都不会好过。
I'm getting the hell out of here.
我要走了。
No.
不。
Yes.
是的。
You stopping me?
你要阻止我？
Get out of my way.
让开
You think you can?
你觉得你能？
Please, just shut up.
闭嘴吧
Yeah, it does.
那好吧
Don't wanna do this.
我不想这样
"Dolled up?"
打扮好的？
I'll dance if I want to.
能否起舞由我决定
Not forcing you.
我没有强迫你
Yeah, I am.
对，来吧
A poem? For me?
给我的诗？
Still creepy, huh?
还是很恶心
Not happening.
不可能
Don't want to fight.
我不想打架
Wait, "non-zero?"
接近于零？
Talked too long already.
说够了吧
No, I can't.
不行
This is wrong.
这是错的
Don't hate yourself.
不要自怨自艾
Just give up.
放弃吧
I'm not her lapdog.
我不是她的手下
Do we have to?
必须这样做？
Sorry.
对不起
Fine, bring it on.
那就来吧
She's human.
她是人类
Good for her.
她做得很好
Yeah, she did.
她做到了
Shut up. For good this time.
闭嘴，是时候算账了

\PN.
\PN。
Y’know, I pretty much assumed this was going to be a trap, but I didn’t think you’d be here.
我一开始就觉得这是个陷阱，但没想到你会在这里。
Well... whatcha doing? Care to explain?
嗯...能解释一下你在做什么吗？
What? You want me to explain this? Velenz? *shrug*
什么？我解释这个？夜幽市？*耸肩*
Oh, I know. But you’re the one standing in front of me.
嗯，我能猜到，但现在你是站在我面前的那个人。
Cute. Never should’ve brought a hero here. Heroes are always trouble.
笑话。永远不要把英雄主义带到现实中，英雄总是会给大家添麻烦。
*snort* Sure, kid. Whatever you say.
*哼* 随便吧，孩子，你说什么就是什么。
I know you’re here with that girl – Candy? Helena’s had her trackers keeping an eye on her for a while now.
我知道你和那个...叫糖儿的女孩在这里。海伦娜已经注意她很长时间了。
She hasn’t been causing too much trouble, though, so we let her go.
不过，她并未造成太多麻烦，所以我们也就没太在意。
Listen, we ran this region. Do you know what that means – taken any political science lately?
听着，我们统治着这个地区，你应该明白这意味着什么...你最学过政治学吗？
It means a monopoly on violence. Every government works the same way.
政治就是需要一些暴力手段，每个政府都是一样的。
Oh, you can call me a tyrant if you want, but I’m no thief.
你可以管我叫暴君，但我不是小偷。
Yep! And a damn good one.
而且还是1个非常出色的人。
Not an absolute one, though – Andris and Helena made up the other two corners of that triangle.
但也不是绝对的...安德里斯和海伦娜组成了这个地区的另外2个角。
Not to mention the extensive bureaucracy of Team Chasm at its height.
更别说裂隙队最鼎盛时期，那庞大且复杂的官僚系统了。
From who? This was a lawless frontier before we came along.
从谁那里夺走的？在我们来这里之前，马凯亚更是1个无法无天的地区。
Only holdouts like Novo truly resisted unification into the larger establishment.
除了最初望新镇的那群顽固分子，其他人都不抵触融入我们。
The benefits of being a tyrant. If people are getting in the way, you can convince them to... stop.
成为暴君的好处是什么？如果有人故意与你做对，你可以“说服”他们停下来。
C’mon. You were raised better than that.
呵，本以为你的家教会更好。
We still rule the region because we ARE the region.
我们仍然统治着这个地区，因为我们就是这个地区。
We’ve got old grunts everywhere who’ll still follow orders if I give them. Helena has her trackers, so we’ve got an intelligence agency.
这里的每一处土地上都有我们的老兵，只要一声令下，他们便会服从。海伦娜也有她自身的追随者，因此我们有了庞大的情报网络。
And she’s got her claws in LuxTech’s outpost here, so economic development is guided by us.
是她在光华市现在的位置创造了那座城市的一切，并依靠科技发展我们的经济。
We were a big organization. All-encompassing. And we had to be: lots of work to do.
我们是1个庞大的组织，无所不包，无所不有，因为我们必须得这样做。
Over just a few decades, we imposed law on this place, created entire new settlements, made it rich and vibrant.
我们用了仅仅几十年的时间，便在这里颁布了法律，创建了人类的聚落，使其变得富有且充满活力。
We quintupled the population. We dealt with outbreaks, infighting, earthquakes. We secured the support of multiple major companies.
这个过程中，马凯亚的人口增长了5倍，我们处理了疾病、自然灾害，还有1次又1次的内部纷争，并获得了多家大公司的支持。
And at the end of the day, we managed to go legit, integrate with the Prizcan government, and aren’t even hated for it.
并最终得以与宏礼市的政府融合，在将混乱控制在最小的情况下，让一切平稳过渡到现在这样。
If you want to try and do even a tenth of that without resorting to violence, be my guest.
如果你觉得想要达成这个目标，一点暴力都不需要使用，那就自身试试吧。
We punished people, which you’d call assault. We imprisoned them, which you’d call kidnapping. We taxed them, which you’d call theft.
我们对罪犯的惩罚被视为攻击，我们对他们的监禁被视为绑架，我们对他们征税被视为盗窃。
Oh, sure, people resisted us, but we only acted how a state does.
当然，有不少人反对过，但是国家的发展更加重要。
Candy’s too young to have been around during Chasm’s zenith.
糖儿她毕竟年纪小，没有经历过裂隙队的鼎盛时期。
She’s got a child’s notion of justice, and she thinks that performing her own little acts of violence fixes anything.
她对正义的概念像个孩子，认为自身的小暴力可以解决问题。
Maybe she should ask herself why almost everyone’s fine with us.
我觉得她应该问问自身，为什么几乎其他所有人都对我们很满意。
Yes.
没错。
Andris did it for money.
安德里斯是为了钱。
Helena did it for power.
海莲娜是为了权力欲。
And I did it so I could finally have the resources to properly research the Regis.
我这么做是为了能有足够的经费来研究巨人。
Everyone in Team Chasm – in any organization – has their own reasons to be there.
裂隙队里的每个人...不管在哪个组织中，他们都有自身的利益诉求。
...We can argue all day, kid. You’re not going to get anywhere.
...孩子，就这个问题，我们可以争论一整天，但不会有任何进展。
Let me put it this way:
这么说吧：
a lot of the Pokémon Candy has “rescued” were given to Chasm grunts for combat purposes, but they ended up liking their new home plenty fine.
糖儿所“拯救”的那些精灵，的确是因战斗目的而征收的，但它们也渐渐喜欢上了新的生活。
Maybe talking things out would’ve resolved things better than theft, huh?
你觉得它们真的想回到原主人身边吗？就算是，那谈判也比偷窃更容易解决问题。
But I know you want to know. What’s up with Velenz? Well, it’s simple. We were trying to work.
我知道你最关心的，还是夜幽市的情况对吧？
I can’t work when I’m being attacked by wannabe heroes. When the power grid is being fried. When Ghost-types are being sent to haunt my lab.
很简单，我们在正常工作的时候，被一些自称为英雄的人攻击了，他们烧毁了电网，并派出幽灵精灵去骚扰实验室。
We asked, repeatedly, for them to stop. They didn’t.
我们1次又1次地，要求他们停下来，但显然没什么用。
So I took Regigigas and had it carve up the bedrock around here, then dragged some avatars in for good measure.
所以我只能带着雷吉奇卡斯，去那里打通地下隧道，并创造出一些化身来保护设施。
They couldn’t prove it was us, but pretty soon they lost their base of operations, and that got the message across.
在我们反攻之后，他们很快就丢盔弃甲了，如今夜幽市的样子就是这一场骚乱的直接结果。
Yes. Was. If they’d wanted to keep it, they could’ve left us alone.
是的，过去是的。不过如果他们想保住它，只要不来打扰我们就可以了。
Kid, have you ever gotten twelve hours of sleep in a week?
你有过一周只睡12个小时的经历吗？
These “freedom fighters” were using every trick in the book. Constantly harrying us. Never a moment’s rest.
这些所谓的“自由战士”几乎把你能想到的诡计都用了一遍。在不断地骚扰下，我们很多人每天只能睡一2个小时。
Ugh. Makes me mad just thinking about it.
啊...想想就来气。
I think so, yeah.
我就说吧。
That’s how it goes. Warfare ain’t pretty, but it exists for a reason.
事实就是，战争并不美好，但它存在是有原因的。
I did what I did. And if someone wants to “bring me to justice” for it, I say: what does that even mean?
我只是做了自身该做的事，如果有人想要因此“将我绳之以法”，那我只想说：那又怎样？
I’m breaking my back running this region, making it better every day.
我正在努力经营这个地区，让它每天变得更好。
You want to throw me in prison? Make this place worse so you can have your petty revenge? Idiocy.
你要把我送进监狱吗？这只会让这个地方变得更糟，唯独满足了你小小的报复心。
I know what I did, and I’m not going to do it again. Neither is anyone else.
我很清楚以前做过些什么，但之后不会，也不需要再做了，当然其他人一样。
...Now, kid. I need to get out of this place, because I don’t particularly want to run into Candy. Get out of my way.
现在，孩子，我该离开这个地方了，因为我不想碰巧遇到糖儿。
You need to work on your active listening. I didn’t ask you a question.
你需要改善你的思维方式，而且我并不是在询问你。
I told you what you were going to do… and now you’re going to do it.
我只是告诉你，你现在需要这样做。
Ugh. Heroes!
呃...英雄？
Damn heroes... well, what’d I really expect.
去特么的英雄...好吧，我到底在期望什么？
Get up.
起来。
I’m not angry, just disappointed. But I will be taking my–
我没有生气，只是失望。但我会带走我的...
\PN! Tamarind!
\PN！塔玛琳！
Stop right there. I – I know I took, um, a little bit to get here, but that’s only because I was eavesdropping!
站住！我...我知道我来晚了，但那只是因为想听听你们说什么！
Candy, is it? Good to meet you in person... I suppose.
糖儿是吗？很高兴亲自见到你...大概吧。
You know where I stand. And I know where you do.
你知道我的立场，我也知道你的。
I’ve just settled things with \PN, so why don’t we have a chat in private? \PN, be a dear for me and leave us. I’d like to end this grudge here and now.
我刚刚解决了与\PN的谈话，所以为什么我们不私下聊聊呢？\PN，你先离开一下吧。我想在这里结束这场仇恨。
...Alright. This is between you and me, anyways. \PN, you can go, like, wait outside.
...这是我们之间的事情，\PN，你可以走了，在外面等一下。
Just for a minute. This’ll be quick.
只需要一分钟，很快...

不仅仅是暴力。
Some hate you.
有些人恨你。
You did it for yourself.
你是为自身而做。
It was their home.
那是他们的家。
That seems excessive.
似乎有些过分。
Fair enough.
有道理。
...
...
No.
不。
...Alright.
...好吧。

Its full of bait to use in fishing.

You an angler? Nah, you don't much look the type.

[Map346]
It's hard for me to fit in here.
我很难融入这里。
I was only invited as a reward for most lines of code written last quarter.
我只是因为上季度写的代码行数最多才被邀请的。
Is that even such a good metric of productivity? I dunno...

Isn't it a bit peculiar that this house is entirely symmetrical?
这所房子是完全对称的，你有没有感觉到很奇怪？
And the mix of Kalosian and Kantonian aesthetics...
虽说融合了卡洛斯和关都的美学...
Maybe you'd disagree, but it rings a mite tacky to me.
或许你不同意我的想法，但我的确觉得很俗。
The most important thing to learn in your life is how to be generous.
人生最重要的，就是要学会对他人慷慨。
I once gave $1,000,000 towards that Pokemon sanctuary west of Velenz.
我曾经向夜幽市西边的那个精灵保护区捐了1,000,000金钱。
Just talking about it has got me in a giving mood. Here, take this.
每次谈起这件事，都会让我感到由衷的满足。这个给你了。
Now now, you wouldn't be asking me to give you another one, would you?
你不会希望我再给你1个吧？慷慨不是冤大头。
The most important thing to learn in your life is how to be happy with what you have.
人生最重要的，就是学会享受自身拥有的一切。

This piece was sculpted by Noel, the Gym Leader on the eastern half of Prizca.
这个作品是东宏礼市的馆主，诺埃尔先生雕刻的。
I can tell just by looking at it!

You know, I had a keen interest in Noel even before all that nonsense with Team Chasm.
要知道我在裂隙队时期之前，就一直在关注诺埃尔了。
I've really hit my stride at LuxTech.
我在光华科技找到了自身的节奏。
Moving smart and talking fast. Striking deals and meeting deadlines.
敏锐地行动，高效地交流，打成目标，满足期望。
I could never show off my talents in Chasm.

索尔迦雷欧和露奈雅拉逃走了，不过不能怪他们，哈！我是不是过于痴迷光了。
Great question! I have no idea!

Something horrible, probably! Fortunately, I’m naturally trauma-immune, so I’ve got that going for me!
或许是一些可怕的事情！但好在，我天生免疫创伤，这是我独有的优势！

As far as I can tell, my mind was hijacked by an extradimensional intelligence of nebulous nature! I dunno!
在我的感知之中，我的思想似乎被1个模糊的超维度智能劫持了！更具体的就不清楚了！
Maybe avatars of Ultra Beasts work differently – I’m not a scientist! Unless you count my PhD in friendology.
也许超级异兽的化身不太一样....当然，我不是科学家！除非你把交朋友博士也算进去。
All I know is I came back to Makya with an amazing catch. Next thing I know I want to become friends with the moon and sun!
我知道的内容就是当时带着一大批收获回到马凯亚，然后就想跟太阳和月亮交朋友。
That’s not really out of character for me, though, so nobody noticed anything was wrong!
不过这对我来说并不是什么不寻常的事情，所以也没有人觉得有什么不对劲！
Let me put it in simple terms!
让我简单说一下吧！
Lainie go Alola. Lainie come back. Lainie feel weeeeird. Lainie accidentally summon manifestations of sun and moon. Oops!
兰妮去阿罗拉了，兰妮回来了，兰妮感觉很奇怪，兰妮不小心召唤出了太阳和月亮的化身，哎呀！
OK!
好的！
Aaapaaaarreeeentlyyy.
显 -------------- 然。
Neeecrooozmaaa.
奈 ------ 克洛 ------ 兹玛。
Caaan – OK, nevermind.
它能 ----- 好吧，算了。
Apparently Necrozma can call Solgaleo and Lunala from across the universe so it can feed off their eternal light!
显然，奈克洛兹玛可以从宇宙的任何地方召唤索尔迦雷欧和露奈雅拉，以便吸取它们永恒的光芒！
Cool! Also, sorry about that one!
很酷！我也对此感到抱歉！
Only legally, and only in Sinnoh! They couldn’t catch me to get me evaluated anywhere else!
只有在合法的情况下，而且只有在神奥地区！他们没办法在其他地方对我评估！
Speaking of catching things: that avatar of Necrozma can call Solgaleo and Lunala from anywhere!
但说到这个了：那个奈克洛兹玛的化身可以从任何地方召唤索尔迦雷欧和露奈雅拉！
And they just show up! To have their endless light, um, ended! Oopsie!
然后它们就出现了！为了让它们无尽的光芒，嗯...结束！诶呀！
I don’t really get how avatars work! Or how Ultra Beasts work! So I REALLY don’t understand what that Necrozma avatar was doing!
我真的不懂化身的原理！或者说超级异兽的存在原理！所以我也真的不知道，那个奈克洛兹玛化身在干什么！
But thanks for getting rid of it, by which I mean me!
但是感谢你把它...我是说我，给消灭了！
Next time just punch me in the face! It’ll probably work better! Oh, also, you should probably take this so there isn’t a next time!
下次直接打我脸吧！这样可能会更有效！哦，还有，你最好拿着这个，这样就不会有下次了！
She hands you a Beast Ball. There is a terrible presence within that threatens to devour all light within the room, and possibly the world.
她递给你1个究极球，里面有一股可怕的气息，吞噬着房间内的所有光亮，甚至还要吞噬整个世界。
It’s probably for the best that Lainie doesn’t have this.
最好还是不要让它继续待在兰妮身边了。
Cool! Have fun with that thing!
好吧！希望玩得开心！
Try not to let it fuse with sources of boundless energy and scour the land and sky with hellish light!
尽量不要让它与无尽能量的源头融合，用地狱般的光芒扫荡大地和天空！
OK! It’s PROBABLY gone for good anyways, so what’s the harm?
嗯，它可能已经永远消失了，所以没有什么害处？
If you change your mind about the mind-hijacking entity of darkness, just ask anytime!
如果你改变了对此的看法，可以随时来找我！

This isle is unique, there isn't anywhere with such a collection of magnificent Pokemon.
这个小岛是独一无二的，其他任何地方都没办法收集到如此多的精灵。
Latios looks you in the eye. It seems interested in you, fleeting as you may be. Its Pokeball lies below it.
拉帝欧斯紧紧盯着你的眼睛。虽然你可能转瞬即逝，但它还是将精灵球放在了下面。
Accept Latios onto your team?
要带走拉帝欧斯吗？
You both have more important things to do right now. You'll come back later. Or not.
你们现在都有重要的事情要做，或许晚点再来，或许不再回来。
You grab the Pokeball off the ground.
你从地上拿起了精灵球。
Latios enters its ball, its eyes never leaving you.
拉帝欧斯在进入球里之前，眼睛一直盯着你。
I just wanted to grab a Gible for my team... They've been making me do training for a week straight...
我就是想来抓一只圆陆鲨...但他们已经让我训练了一周了...
NO PAIN NO GAIN! 1000 YEARS OF HISTORY WASN'T SPENT LOUNGING AROUND! THE GUARDIANS WOULD BE DISSAPOINTED!
没有痛苦就没有收获！1000年的时光不是用来闲逛的！守护者会为取巧的行为感到失望！
THE GUARDIANS WILL LIKE YOU TRAINER. YOU AND STRUGGLE ARE CLOSE FRIENDS.
守护者会喜欢你这个训练师的，你是个懂得奋斗的好朋友。
This guy is crazy he wakes me up at 4 AM every day to train please help me.
这伙计疯了，每天凌晨4点叫醒我让我去训练，救命！
PRIZCA WASN'T BUILT IN A DAY. THE GUARDIANS BLESS THOSE WHO TRIUMPH, NOT THOSE WHO COWER FROM IMPROVEMENT!
宏礼市不是一天建成的！守护者会祝福胜利者，但不会祝福畏缩不前者！
Please help me he's gonna make me run laps.
救救我，我不想再跑圈了。
Latias greets you with a smile. You've certainly piqued its interest! Its Pokeball lies below it.
拉帝亚斯微笑着向你打招呼。你显然引起了它的兴趣！它的精灵球就在它下方。
Accept Latias onto your team?
要带走拉帝亚斯吗？
Latias senses your indecision. No worries! There's always a different chapter in our lives.
拉帝亚斯察觉到了你的犹豫不决，别担心，生活总有不同的篇章。
Latias' smile grows even bigger. With a twirl, it enters its ball.
拉帝亚斯的笑容更灿烂了。它转了个圈，进入了球中。
Years ebb and flow, yet it never seems to slow.
岁月荏苒，它从未放缓脚步。
Spend those years wisely, Trainer. There is only so much we can do.
明智地渡过这些时光吧，训练师，我们能做的，始终有限。
For now though, I think I'll enjoy watching the little monsters here. A good use of our time.
不过现在，我喜欢在这里的时间，享受跟他们一起相处的每一秒。
Sacred cheating holy crap!
投机取巧有理！
The other guy over there keeps talking about ancient rites and sacred duties and stuff...
那个家伙一直在谈论什么古老的仪式和神圣的职责啥的...
Wish the guardians mentioned something about ancient ice cream and ancient days off...

我和守护者们正等待着你的挑战，证明你的力量，证明你的价值。

我猜你现在没什么事可做了。
Wanna just keep fighting me? I collected a ton of different Pokemon during this journey, so I have a lot of teams I want to try out.
想继续和我对战吗？我在这次旅程中收集了很多不同的精灵，所以有很多队伍想试试。
Ooh, to spice it up, I should switch to different teams between battles. A surprise every time!

这...看起来你点数不够。
Well, the offer stands.
不过这提议依然有效。
Pick your moves well! It’s not just about hitting hard.
Pick your moves well! It’s not just about hitting hard.
A momentum move like Volt Switch can get a fast Pokémon out before it gets hit or let a slow defensive one take a hit for an ally while switching.

Stealing or removing items makes most Pokémon way easier to deal with.
偷取或移除物品会让大多数精灵更容易对付。
Or just go fast with a priority move!
或者直接用先制技能快攻！
They can stop a sweep from being, um, swept, or just get one last punch in before your slow Pokémon go down.
它们可以阻止对手的推队，或者在慢速精灵倒下前打出最后一击。
No
不
Yes
是的

Sure, let's go.

Hello to you, young one.
你好，年轻人。
I am Hekata. Known as a historian in some circles, and as a witch in others.
我是经方，某些人管我叫历史学家，也有很多人管我叫女巫。
Have you delved into the earth of Makya?
你有没有深入探索马凯亚的土地？
In the nearby mine I did, and discovered a wondrous secret in its depths: An ore holding ancient powers.
在附近的矿场深处，我发现了1个秘密：一块蕴含着古老力量的矿石。
By long study of yellowed scrolls in the archives of Sinnoh I finally came to understand its purpose, and my own along with it.
在研究过神奥地区的历史古迹后，我终于理解了其背后的含义，并得知了基本的运用方法。
That being: Transmuting Origin Ore into Pokemon thought long extinct in the land of Hisui.
将起源矿石之内的力量，转化到已经灭绝的洗翠精灵体内。
Speak to me again if you wish to see me perform my spell.
如果你需要我施展这种魔法，就来找我吧。
You need only provide me a chunk of Origin Ore, and I can prepare my spell right away.
你只需要提供一块起源矿石，我就能完成整个仪式。
Seeking your own destiny, I see. I understand.
我能理解，你也只是在追寻自身的命运。
I am glad that you answered my summons.
很高兴你响应了我的召唤。
I suppose now is the time for proper introductions.
我觉得是时候做个正式的自我介绍了。
By long study of yellowed scrolls in the archives of Sinnoh I came to understand Origin Ore, and my purpose along with it.
通过我长期研究神奥的古籍，我逐渐了解了起源矿石的一切，以及我接下来要做的事情。
After the more urgent matter is finished, return to me and I will gladly perform my spell for you.
等你把紧急事项都做完之后，再来这里找我吧，我很乐意为你施法。
Without further ado, let us begin discussing the topic I mentioned in our phone call.
话不多说，我们直接开始正题吧。
For some time now I have been keen to a gathering of magical energy within Mt. Kilna.
我...大概有一段时间了吧...一直关注着基尔纳山的能量聚集现象。
I believe the earthquake that shook this region after your championship victory was linked to this.
我觉得你夺冠后的震颤，也跟这件事有一定关系。
However, before I could study the phenomenon in earnest, it dissipated almost entirely.
不过，我还没来得及，认真研究这一现象的本质，它就悄然消失了。
I've heard through my connections that you may have had something to do with that.
所以...我觉得既然可能跟你有关...
Although, details are scarce.
哪怕只有一丁点关联，
I ask you now. Would you let an old witch in on the secret?
我也希望你能将其告知于我。
Zounds! What a wondrous story.
这...真是个神奇的故事。
You've witnessed some very ancient magicks indeed.
你亲眼见证了古老的魔法。
...Regigigas, the demiurge, the lord golem of legend.
雷吉奇卡斯...传说中的精灵。
It is no surprise that the very earth would quake in its presence...
地球在它面前震颤，这一切都说得通了...
Allow me to ponder the situation.
请先允许我思考一下。
In my envisioning, primal energy yet lingers in the place you confronted Yezera.
在我的感知之中，原始的能量还萦绕在你和叶泽拉交战的地方。
If you should return to that spot, you should find some <imp>artifact</imp> of her ritual.
如果你回到那个地方，或许能找到一些她用来祭祀的<imp>工艺品</imp>。
To allow such an object to roam free in this world... t'would be an act of mighty hubris.
让这样1个存在在世界上驰骋...真是一种狂妄的行为。
I beseech you, delve once again <imp>underneath Mt. Kilna</imp>, and find it.
我恳求你，再次进入<imp>基尔纳山地下</imp>，然后找到它！
Then, return to me so that I can examine it for you.
然后，带它来见我，我会帮你破解其中的秘密。
I suppose I will merely have to respect your choice in this matter.
不过，至于怎么选择，我会完全尊重你自身的意愿。
Secrets and I are well acquainted, after all.
毕竟，我和秘密很熟悉。
If the winds of change do blow upon your spirit in this matter, do speak to me again.
如果因为某件事，使变革之风再次吹向你，就再来找我吧。
Do you seek me for my spellcraft? Or is it time to satiate my curiosity on the matter of Mt. Kilna?
你是为了我的法术才来的？还是要满足我对基尔纳山的好奇心？
Very well, let me turn my thoughts to Hisui.
好的，让我们先将目光放到洗翠。
Have you collected the remnant of Regigigas' magicks?
你找到雷吉奇卡斯的魔法残余了吗？
Delightful! My thanks upon you.
真是太好了，谢谢。
Hand it to me, posthaste.
快拿给我看看吧！
You hand the Primal Clay over to Dr. Hekata.
你将原始粘土交给了赫卡塔博士。
Yes! Exactly as expected. This is a most powerful catalyst for ancient magicks.
嗯，跟我预想中一样，这是古代魔法的强大催化剂。
The very legends of yore should be now at your fingertips.
昔日的传奇，现在就在你的股掌之间。
You will only need to find echoes of their power to which to attune it.
你只需要找到他们力量的回音，就可以调整它了。
That task I leave to you, as my body is not suited to the travel that will surely be required.
这个任务依旧要交给你了，因为我的身体状态不适合长途旅行。
Dr. Hekata hands back the Primal Clay.
赫卡塔博士将原始粘土还给你。
As for myself, I should still be able to make use of the Primal Clay's catalytic power.
至于我自身这边，我应该能利用原始粘土的催化能力。
Through my various implements, I can craft a mimicry of the essences of a few <imp>lesser Pokemon of legend</imp>.
通过我的各种工具，或许可以尝试模仿一些<imp>传说精灵的精髓之处</imp>。
What I shall need from you is more Origin Ore, of course.
当然，同时需要更多起源矿石。
I shall also need a living creature to study.
还要研究具体的每种生命。
With those requirements, one might even dub this process "cloning."
有了这些前提条件，就能达成人们所说的“克隆”了。
Hahaha, what a thought!
哈哈哈，真是个好主意！
Ahem, regardless...
咳咳，不管怎样...
It would be my honor to perform this grand new spell for you.
我很荣幸能为你施展这个咒语。
Please return to me when you have the neccessary components.
请你拿到必要的材料后再来找我吧。
You need only provide me a chunk of Origin Ore, and I can prepare either of my spells right away.
你只需要给我一块起源矿石，我就能为你施展1次法术。
Which of my spells would you like me to perform for you?
你想让我施展哪种法术？

Wow, you're really strong! If there really was a Trainer in front of you, you'd show them who's boss!
哇，你真的很强大！不管你遇到什么训练师，都可以教教他们谁才是老大！

I didn’t expect to be here, honestly. Got the invite from Tamarind and nearly threw it in the trash.
说实话我也没想到自身会来，接到塔玛琳的邀请后，我差点顺手就扔进了垃圾桶里。
But I figured, ah, why not? So, uh, I’m here.
但是...呃...转念一想，我...呃...为啥不来呢？
Good job becoming Champion. I guess?
总之，能成为冠军代表你干得不错。
Gonna be honest: I don’t really know you. But I guess you’re cool, so… yeah, congrats.
其实我并不怎么了解你，但看起来挺不错的，所以...还是得恭喜你。
Freeing me from being a gym leader is worth a thousand times more to me than this whole mess.
对我来说，把我从道馆馆主这个烂摊子上解放出来，才是最重要的事。
You done lollygagging? We can get started whenever you want.
玩够了吗？可以开始了吗？
You want me to count the number of seconds we’ve got this room for?
你想让我数数在这个房间里待了多少秒吗？
Because I can. I’ve got a timer set.
而且我还正好带的有秒表。
Fine, go. Make it quick, though.
算了，随你吧，尽量快点。
Let’s get this started. Quick ceremony.
开始吧，快速仪式。
Purely, uh, ceremonial. I don’t even have a trophy to give you.
当然...呃...就只是个仪式，并没有奖杯什么的。
Alright…
现在...
With the shockingly broad powers invested in me as Makya’s regional Professor, I hereby –
作为马凯亚地区的博士，我在此以我的权力...
Is this the part where I say “I object?”
我能说“我反对”吗？
\PN. You’re looking better.
\PN，你看起来气色不错。
Helluva lot better than last time I saw you, to be honest. This place suits you.
说实话比上次见面时好多了，或许是这地方很适合你？
So does not burning the Litwick at both ends.
起码比烛光灵好一些。
Damn straight!
对！我就说了！
Sorry I’m late – my companion here apparently has some outstanding warrants and I needed to grease a few palms.
首先，我迟到了，因为我的队友还有几张逮捕令，我得去打点一下。
You know how it is.
你知道是怎么回事。
That’s me! But, seriously, c’mon.
真是...他奶奶滴...
You got the title of Champion the second you beat me. You want her to tell you it, or me?
你打败我后拿到冠军头衔，难道还需要我告诉妈妈？
Hahaha!
哈哈哈！
Hey, kiddo. Are you actually glad to see me?
嘿，小鬼，见到我高兴不？
I can’t even remember the last time that happened.
我都不记得上次这么高兴是什么时候了
Oh, but I’m forgetting: this is Zoé.
哦，我忘了：这是佐伊。
You two’ve met, I know.
我知道你们认识。
After I left, I ran into her. One thing led to another, and now we’re a thing. Sorry to break your heart if you were hoping for an edgy industrial goth GF.
锦标赛结束后，我遇到了她，然后一来二去，我们就成了。如果你也想找1个前卫的哥特女友，很抱歉伤了你的心咯。
*hiss* The mask’s practical, idiot! And I’m not edgy!
*哼*戴面具是为了实用，而且我也不搞什么哥特式！
Ugh. If you want edge, I’ll show you edge. Wait till you see me dressed to the nines.
哼，我什么时候打扮一下，绝对亮瞎你们的狗眼。
He wishes.
想屁吃！
...Ugh. Sorry, that’s reflexive. Yes, we’re dating.
...呃...抱歉，条件反射...没错，我们在约会。
*hiss* Leave Mavis out of this.
*哼*跟她没关系。
I haven’t even met her and I already hate her guts.
虽然没见过她，但我对她没什么好印象。
You talking to me or him? 'Cause we both disappeared for a few months. It’s a long story.
你在跟我还是他说话？至于我们消失的这段时间...
Oh, no, keep going, you three.
我...随便，你们继续吧。
I really want to hear more about which of you is dating the gym leader I forgot existed. We’ve got all day.
我也很想知道你怎么追上1个道馆馆主的，我们有一整天的时间听八卦。
Actually, you know what, that’s a good point. Fine, Zain, you were the runner-up.
不过，再怎么说，赞恩也是今年的亚军。
You do the ceremony! I finally get to delegate! Now I know what it feels like to be Helena!
那你来主持仪式！海伦娜，我明白你的感受了！
You three gremlins get this figured out. I’m done! I’m out!
你们3个自身来主持，老娘不玩了！
OK, I think it goes something like this.
好嘞，我觉得吧，应该...
With the – what’d she say? – shockingly broad powers invested in me? As, what, your jackass older brother?
她刚才...呃...说的啥来着？我，作为你的混蛋哥哥，
With said powers, I hereby bestow upon you, \PN, the title of Champion.
\PN，在此授予你冠军称号。
Y’know, for being a spoiled rich brat and a golden child, you’re actually pretty cool. You want a hug?
要知道，1个被宠坏的富二代，能做到这一步，真的很酷！要来1个拥抱吗？
Aww, kid. Damn...
你这小子...该死...
*hiss* Sorry. You two are too cute not to join.
*噗嗤*抱歉，你俩太有意思了。
\PN, I promise we’re gonna take care of you from now on whether you like it or not, OK?
\PN，这样吧，不管你乐不乐意，以后我们都会照顾你，怎么样？
Zain and I have been talking about you and Mavis and everything and... yeah. We’re gonna adopt you if we have to.
赞恩一直跟我谈论你和你母亲，还有之前的其他事情...如果有必要，我们会收养你。
Well, that’s moving a little fast... but, yeah. What she means to say is that I want to make things up to you.
不是...这有点过了...不过，也差不多，反正会补偿你就是了。
And that means being there for you.
也就代表，会陪在你身边。
So, y’know, if things don’t work out with Mavis and you need someone... we’re your family. If you’ll have us.
如果你跟妈妈那边不顺利，如果你还需要的话，我们也依然是你的家人。
Hah!
哈哈！
Don’t worry, I get it. I deserve that.
啊，我知道，这才对。
But, uh, listen, kid: if you need me, I’m here. Same goes for Zoé.
不过，小鬼：如果你什么时候需要帮忙了，我和佐伊都会出现。
If things don’t work out with Mavis, we’ll be your family. If you’ll have us.
如果你跟妈妈那边不顺利，如果你还需要的话，我们也依然是你的家人。
You never gotta be alone. Alright?
你不会因此而孤独的。
Of course. You’re welcome, kiddo. Champion. \PN. Whatever you’re called now.
当然，不客气，小鬼。还是说冠军？\PN？不管你现在喜欢哪个称呼。
I can’t promise much, but I’ll be there for you. Things are gonna be different now.
我没办法做出太多承诺，但最起码的陪伴，还是没问题的。
Love you too. Can’t believe I didn’t for a little while there.
我也爱你。可能在某个时间点不爱你。
But, hey, we can’t change the past, right? Only the future. Things are gonna be different now.
不过，我们没办法改变过去，但未来可以，一切都会不同。
I know you will. You’re tough, and you’re smart.
或许吧，你很坚强，也很聪明。
But if you ever aren’t fine, I’m here for you. We are.
但是你也会遇到一些问题，总之，我们都会陪着你。
Things are gonna be different now.
现在已经不同于往日了。
It would be totally disrespectful to leave now, while everyone is waiting for you!
现在大家都在等你，你就这么走了是不是不太尊重？
Hello, nondescript friend!
你好，不起眼的朋友！
I am studiously not remembering any prior interaction we may or may not have had!
我刻意没有去回忆，我们之前是不是有过互动！
I am present at this location to support you in whatever endeavor you are here to undertake!
无论你在做什么，我都会在这里支持你！
I do this because you are my friend and Lainie does not let her friends down!
我这样做因为你是我的朋友，而兰妮不会让她的朋友失望！
Even if sometimes she really wishes she could just forget about them and the incredibly awkward things they witnessed...
即便她真的希望能忘掉他们，忘掉一些亲眼目睹的，令人难以置信的尴尬往事...
Hello, \PN.
你好，\PN。
The importance of the Champion title is lost on me, but I received an invitation, and had no intention of refusing it.
我不知道冠军的头衔有多重要，但我受到了这份邀请，并且不打算拒绝。
Consider this minor show of moral support repayment for your assistance. Congratulations.
就当这是对您的帮助，给予的小小回报吧，祝贺你。
Hey! \PN! Great work!
嘿！\PN！干的不错！
I am absolutely STOKED that you got an actual ceremony. I sent Tamarind five letters telling her how disappointed I was that the whole thing got ruined!
很高兴这个仪式能够顺利举行，我之前给塔玛琳寄了五封信，告诉她我对仪式被毁有多么失望！
I, uh, also tried to see if Zoé would show up, but she’s still gone. Starting to get worried about her.
我...呃...不知道佐伊会不会出现，她已经消失很长一段时间了，我有点担心她的情况。
But that’s a me problem! You just relax!
但这是我自身的问题，你只需要休息和放松就可以了！
Howdy. Hope you ain’t feelin’ stood up.
诶嘿，希望你不会觉得被放鸽子了。
I plan on buyin' you a drink, never you worry. Just ain't been feelin' it with Yez gone.
我本来打算请你一起喝一杯，但是...也没什么，就是叶泽拉不在，没什么心情。
Part of my mind just ain’t in the here and now. Figured I’d show up for this, at least. I’ve been thinkin’ 'bout you more than I’d like to admit. Hah!
我最近一直有些心不在焉，所以我觉得应该来这里放松一下，我猜你肯定在更深层地揣测我的想法？哈哈！
Don’tcha go givin’ me that look. Go on. Git. We’ll have time enough for chit-chat later.
别用那种眼神看着我，这是你的典礼，之后我们还有很多时间可以闲聊。
Hah. Damn kid...
哈哈，你个臭小鬼...
Hey! Lookin’ pretty good. Sorry this took so long to get set up.
嘿，看起来不错嘛，抱歉花了这么久才弄好。
We were supposed to get you officially coronated as Champion right after the tournament, but then there was The Incident.
我们本来该在锦标赛结束后，就让你加冕为冠军的，只是没想到发生了那种事。
And since it takes eight billion years to get anything through bureaucracy limbo here, it’s... how late is this?
然后还要花80亿年通过上面的官僚弄好文件，所以...到底晚了多久？
Three months? Two and a half?
3个月？还是2个半月？
Oh, and we only have thirty minutes, so let’s keep it moving.
算了，我们只有三十分钟时间，大家还是快点吧。
Thanks. Can’t help but notice you didn’t say I was lookin’ good... but that’s fair, I guess.
谢谢，但我注意到你并没说“我看起来很棒”...那就对了，你不需要撩我。
For one, I’m like twenty-five years older than you. And, uh, for two I’ve got some grey coming in.
首先，我大了你二十五岁，其次，我头发都白了。
Never let it be said I aged with grace.
虽然我不希望有人说我老了。
But who’s counting? You want me to tell you I’m sorry? You know me well enough to know I’m not gonna.
是谁一天天在数？你想让我给你道歉吗？你知道我不可能这么做。
I’ve had enough on my plate without trying to set up your little victory lap.
我的事情已经够多了，别再用我给你的胜利铺路了。
You’re very welcome.
不客气。
At least someone appreciates the monumental effort I put into this damn region.
至少有人能欣赏到，我对这个该死的地区，付出了多大的努力。
You know how hard it is to get even a single person in a room for half an hour in Makya?
你知道在马凯亚，想安静地在房间里待半个小时有多难吗？
Everyone’s always scheming or brooding or committing sins.
每个人都心怀鬼胎，不知道打着什么算盘。
But like I said, we’re on a timer, so let’s get moving.
但是，我们时间不多，所以赶快行动起来。
I know certain individuals who will remain unnamed will have their eyes on their watches the entire time.
我知道某些不愿透露姓名的人，会一直盯着手表看。
Honestly I can’t believe the stars aligned to get everyone I needed in one place for this long. Minor miracle.
说实话，我有点难以相信，在这么短的时间内，让所有人都待在这同1个地方。
Anyways! Let’s go, let’s go!
不管怎么说，开始吧！
There’s a letter on the table. The paper smells faintly of perfume, and you know it’s for you.
凳子上有一封信，信纸上有淡淡的香味，你知道这是谁给你的。
“Congratulations. You deserve this. You’re this region’s gleaming star.
“祝贺你，这是你应得的，你是这个地区熠熠生辉的新星。
Make them respect you. Make them worship you. They don’t deserve you.
让他们都尊敬你，崇拜你，让他们觉得自身配不上你。
Please accept my utmost apologies for not being able to attend. I still have matters to attend to.
请接受我对未能出席会议的歉意，因为现在还有事情要处理。
Loose ends to be wrapped up – or severed. We’ll be together soon, and then never parted again.
无论持续多久...我们很快就会再会，并从此不再分离。
Ever yours, S.”
永远属于你的，S。”
Hmph. Nice to see you doing well.
嗯，你做的很好。
It was only a walk to get here, and I needed an excuse to get out anyways. I don’t really keep up with current events.
我平时不太关心时事，来这里也只需要走几步路，就当找个借口出来逛逛了。
Guess you did pretty well, though. That tracks. I can see it.
不过想必你干得相当不错，这几天我也从别人口中听到不少。
Takes a lot to impress me. You do. Keep at it.
能打动我可没有那么容易，但你做到了，继续加油吧。
There’s a Ditto in attendance. It roils amicably, seemingly glad that its mythical counterpart is taking the attention off of it.
有一只百变怪也来了，它友好地发出声音，似乎很高兴传说中的同类，将目光从它身上移开。
It gleams up at you with pinpoint eyes. You’re sure in its head it’s making a joke about you, but not at your expense.
它的眼睛炯炯有神地盯着你，它肯定是在拿你开玩笑。
Hats off to you, champ. The moment you first beat me, I knew you were in this for the long haul.
向你致敬，冠军。从你第1次打败我那一刻起，我就知道你能坚持到今天这里。
If only I knew how right I was. I would’ve made some bets! Hah!
如果我知道这次的预感这么准，我就直接梭哈下注了，哈哈！
Hey, Champion! Didn’t expect to see me?
嘿，冠军，没想到我会来吧？
I’ve been, like, superglued to Tammy’s side the past few months. Couldn’t get away even if I wanted to.
我...大概...这几个月都被粘在塔米身边了，想走都走不了。
But, like, I wouldn’t miss it for the world, dummy! Love ya way too much to miss this!
但是，大概...我不可能错过的，傻瓜！我那么喜欢你，怎么会错过呢！
Ah, my dear \PN. I’ve been watching your ascendance with prying eyes ever since I eloped unto the night.
啊，可爱的\PN。自从你将我带出黑夜之后，我就一直在注视着你的崛起。
You show such grace and strength! No one could be disappointed with your performance.
你表现得如此优雅，坚强！每个人都会为对的表现满意。
But there’s someone you wish was here, isn’t there?
但你希望某个人也在这里对吧？
Never fear! A late entrance is a dramatic entrance, wouldn’t you agree, darling? Ahaha!
别担心，或许就像戏剧中那样，只是姗姗来迟，你觉得呢小可爱？
There’s a Mew in attendance. Nobody seems to know what to make of that.
还有一只梦幻也来了，没人知道这是怎么回事。
Personally, the Mew seems to be exulting in being an enigma. It also seems rather proud of you, and its similarly-mutable companion.
梦幻好像对这种状态很高兴，它似乎还在为你，还有它那同样难以捉摸的队友而感到骄傲。
Your suffering has reached its end! The long, arduous climb has culminated with you at the zenith of Makya!
你的苦难已经结束了！通过这漫长而艰辛的路程，你已经到达了马凯亚的顶峰！
I hope beyond hope that my tempering has contributed to your victory.
我衷心希望我的锤炼，为你的胜利做出了贡献。
Now that role belongs to you! Test all challengers! Test them with fury and frenzy!
现在，这个角色属于你了！去测试所有的挑战者，用愤怒和狂热让他们成长！
Oh, \PN, I’m so happy to see you!
哦，\PN，看到你这么好我可太高兴了！
You deserve to have your victory celebrated. You’ve done so much for all of us. Thank you.
去庆祝你应得的胜利吧，同时也替大家，对你所做的一切表示感谢。
Now go enjoy your time in the spotlight – even if this ceremony is a little smaller than I’d like.
现在去享受你在聚光灯下的时间吧...虽说这个仪式比我想象中简陋了点。
One sec.
不急。
Yeah, I'm ready.
开始吧。
Zain.
赞恩。
You made it!
你已经说了！
Jackass.

Hey, kiddo.

That's where you’ve been?

Hug him.

你转过身去，什么都没看到，但再次回头时，它手里多了1个精灵球。
Mesprit wants to join your team. Will you have it?
要带走艾姆利多吗？
It does a quick twirl and enters the Pokeball.
它快速转了一圈，然后便进入了精灵球。
You decide to let it be for now. You need more time to gather yourself.
你决定暂时先不这样做，你需要更多时间来调整自身。
Catch Mesprit.
带走。
Leave Mesprit.
算了。

Whoa, Azelf! How did it get here?
哇，亚克诺姆！它为什么在这里？
The only thing you can glean from it is the self- assured smirk on it's face.
你唯一能从它脸上看到的，就是那自信满满的笑容。
It leans back in the air, kicking up it's feet. It points towards your hand.
它在空中后仰翻腾，指向了你的双手。
You were... holding a Pokeball? You look back up to see Azelf shrugging at you, still sporting the same grin.
你...正拿着1个精灵球？你抬起头，看到亚克诺姆耸耸肩，脸上还挂着同样的笑容。
Azelf wants to join your team. Will you have it?
要带走亚克诺姆吗？
You see a quick salute from Azelf as it enters its ball.
它快速敬了1个礼，便进入了它的精灵球中。
You decide to let it be for now. You'll need to be ready for your next hill.
你决定暂时顺其自然，为翻过下一座山做好准备。
Catch Azelf.
带走。
Leave Azelf.
算了。

I knew most of the Trainers going in, but man, this X guy is wild.
我知道大部分训练师都回来，但是这个“X”也太离谱了。
No one's ever heard him mention his real name. He just calls himself X.
没人知道他的真名是什么，他只说自身是“X”。
Rolls with a bunch of Normal and Fairy types. Has a Gardevoir in his back pocket as well for some nasty reverse sweeps.
他擅长一般和妖精属性的精灵，而且还有一只强大的沙奈朵。
I'll tell you, X is really looking to give it to us this year...
悄悄告诉你，之前“X”还想把它送给我的...
You look nervous. Are you?
你看起来有些紧张？
Hey, gets to the best of us. I bet every single name written on those statues got there in spite of nerves.
即便是最强者也会这样，我敢打赌，雕像上的每个名字，当时也会有这种感觉。

Here, take this. On me.

无论你需不需要，这就算是我的一份心意了。
Now have fun out there champ. Err, future champ? You know what I mean.
希望我们的冠军...呃...未来的冠军玩得开心！
What are ya talking to me for? I only got one pep talk in me.
又来找我说话？我只会给你1次鼓励。
Go in there, do your best, and make sure you won't regret anything.
现在去吧，尽你所能，永远不要让自身后悔。
Well, well, if it isn't the new champion of Makya.
诶哟，这不是新的冠军嘛！
You really shined out there, almost brough a tear to me eye.
这耀眼的光辉，让我想掉眼泪了。
I can tell you probably aren't native Makyan, but you did the region proud. Wear the title well, Trainer.
我知道你不是土生土长的马凯亚人，但这个地区也会为你而骄傲，这是你赢得的头衔，训练师。

An old, beaten up laptop. A couple dozen windows are open all at once.
一台破旧的笔记本电脑，同时有几10个窗口被打开了。
Something is being researched, but it's impossible to tell what specifically.
有些还在研究中的内容，但看不懂具体是什么。
It's Nora's laptop. She must have forgotten it in her hurry to get to Svait.
这是诺拉的笔记本电脑，她肯定是急着去霜皑镇，忘了带上它。
A map displayed on the screen shows a path to the west of the Ranger Station there.
屏幕上显示的地图上，有一条从霜皑镇往西走的小路。
“Over 2500 years ago, there existed a sect of itinerant priests who worshipped a Legendary Carver of Clay.
“2500年前，有1个巡回祭祀教派，一直崇拜着传说中的粘土雕刻师。
And by its hand, people were able to claim dominion over inhospitable lands high and low.
在它的帮助下，人们才得以在高低崎岖的荒凉土地上繁衍生息。
Yet, despite their efforts, humanity was cast out from the lands where the primal forces of this world worked.
尽管他们付出了许多努力，但人类终究还是被世界上最为原始的力量赶出了那里。
Back to the caves; which their species used to call home. Now the caverns would be their tombs…"
洞穴，那是它们曾经的家园，洞穴，那将成为它们的坟墓..."
Guess I forgot to keep the door locked… but I can’t really turn away the esteemed Champion \PN, now can I?
哦？看来我忘了锁门了...不过我也不能拒绝尊贵的冠军，\PN，对吧？
I don’t know why you’re here but, if I had to make a guess… you’re searching for something; like I am.
我不知道你为什么来这里，但根据我的猜测...你应该像我一样，在找什么吧？
Name’s Nora. I like to think of myself as a seeker of knowledge.
我是诺拉，我一般喜欢将自身称为“知识的探求者”。
I took up a job as a janitor here to gain access to this library, since it’s sealed off to the public.
为了能进入这座图书馆，我特意应聘了这里的管理员，毕竟这儿并不对外开放。
It’s not trespassing if they’re paying you to be here.
现在我有正经理由待在这里，就不能算是非法入侵了。
Team Chasm apparently had roots in anthropology, based on all the records they’ve shoved away here.
从他们藏在这里的记录来看，裂隙队显然也是从人类学开始一点点入手的。
Translated passages with way too many sticky notes go over all kinds of myths and legends.
这些经过翻译的文献上，大大小小的全是便签，其中涉及到各种神话传说。
One that caught my eye involves the Seekers, those ancient priests I mentioned earlier.
我最在意的还是那些探索者...当然也可以管他们叫古代祭司。
They were ultimately destroyed by a great darkness that some protector deity was apparently equipped to handle.
他们最终被庞大的黑暗能量毁灭，而他们所信仰的守护神，显然没有应对这种黑暗的方法。
But, based on the fact that the Seekers disappeared, the guardian must have failed in its duty.
那些探索者就此销声匿迹，而这位失职的守护神也不见了踪影。
Why? I don’t know.
至于具体的原因，我不知道。
The notes here make reference to materials that I can’t find anywhere in this room.
这里的注释当中提到了这个图书馆没有收录的材料。
I’m thinking that these records have to exist elsewhere.
或许这些记录存在于其他什么地方。
And I’m going to assume that they must have been saved digitally, as there’s nowhere else in the region with this much literature.
考虑到裂隙队，这些文献有可能是以数字形式保存下来的，不然我想不到它还会在哪儿。
Do you think you can search LuxTech for any servers hosting data from before Team Chasm was established?
你能在光华市的档案中，搜索到一些裂隙队解散之前，所存放的数据或者服务器地址吗？
I’ll keep on searching here in the meantime for something hidden in the stacks.
当然，我也会试着在这里，找找有没有其他相关的内容。
Let me know if you find something over at LuxTech.
如果你在光华市找到些什么的话，就来告诉我吧。
I’ve only been finding fun facts, the kind you’d see on a moving truck.
我这里只看到一些趣闻，类似在搬家卡车上那种小故事。
Did you know that hexagons were an important symbols of the Seekers?
据说那些探索者的标志，是一种六边形。
That’s apparently what inspired Team Chasm’s logo.
恐怕这也是裂隙队标志的来源。
You’re back! Excellent.
你回来了！太好了！
I managed to make a breakthrough while you were away.
在你去那边搜集材料时，我这里也取得了突破。
Would you mind showing me what you’ve found first?
能先给我看看你找到了什么吗？
You hand over the Old USB Drive.
你将旧U盘交给她。
Nora loads the device on her laptop.
诺拉将其链接在笔记本上了。
Fascinating.
太惊人了。
This one file, Project Chrysopoeia Albedo, goes into great detail of a large volcanic eruption thousands of years ago which heavily impacted the region.
这份名为“莹润金成计划”的文件里，详细描述了数千年前的1次规模浩大的火山爆发，以及其对该地区造成的严重影响。
It makes sense that the large clouds of ash would be devastating to a civilization in its technological infancy.
大量的火山灰对于正处于技术萌芽阶段的文明造成了毁灭性的打击。
This must be the "great darkness" that the Seekers mentioned.
这一定就是“庞大的黑暗”。
Perhaps that’s also why they built what would become the underground ruins; like those found in Mt. Kilna?
或许这就是他们建造地下城市的原因？就像基尔纳山发现的那些。
Maybe those places were meant to be safe spaces from the smog?
或许这些地方本就是躲避火山灰影响的安全地带？
Wait, no. Why would they have built shelters if they had the guardian?
等等，不对劲！他们不是还有守护者吗？
Hahaha. This is the rush I’ve been seeking.
哈哈哈，这就是我所追寻的！
Questions whose answers are more questions.
问题接着答案，答案又会催生出新的问题。
As for my own findings: I found references to an aboveground ruins site which might lead to what we’re after.
对了，还有我这边的发现：我找到1个地面废墟的参考资料，那里或许有我们要找的东西。
I’ll be waiting for you in <imp>Svait, on the upper level</imp>.
我会到 <imp>霜皑镇上层</imp>，海拔稍微高点的地方等你。

Wow! It's a Volcanion, trapped inside a large boulder!
哇，是一只被困在石头里面的波尔凯尼恩！
Hey, \PN! Come around to the front.
嘿，\PN！来这边！
It’s still so striking to me that at any time, Team Chasm could’ve added this protector of the region to its arsenal.
按照裂隙队的行事风格，他们总会把所有能利用的力量都变成自身的武器，可是...
Sure, they managed to capture Heatran, the Titans, and other oddities I still need to comb that USB about.
就像席多蓝恩和巨人们那样，我还得继续梳理一下U盘里的内容。
But were they so dominated by Yezera that they thought Volcanion wouldn’t make a difference?
还是说因为叶泽拉的控制，才导致他们对波尔凯尼恩的态度发生了变化？
It makes me realize how terrifying going against a single person with overwhelming power can be.
这让我意识到，与1个拥有压倒性力量的人为敌是多么可怕的事情。
...as you showed me, \PN.
就像你对我来说，\PN。
Anyway, ready?
总之，准备好了吗？
Nora brings out a small MP3 player, and presses a button.
诺拉拿出了1个小型MP3，并按下了其中1个按钮。
A soothing recording of an ancient flute fills the air.
舒缓悠扬的古笛声响起。
Ah. Seems like we have unwanted guests at this once private concert.
啊，看来有不速之客闯进我们的私人音乐会了。
Awesome. At least they look in the mood to dance.
也不错，至少它们看起来，也有共舞一曲的心情。
I guess we can crack some heads open, show them a genuine mosh pit experience.
不过我们还是把它们的脑袋敲开，展示一下什么叫“大场面”吧。
What do you think, \PN?
你觉得呢，\PN？
Ah. I realize now that, while I patched your team up after our battle, I’m out of supplies to heal my own.
啊，有点糟糕，我之前在战斗后为你的精灵恢复状态，结果导致我自身的药品不够了。
I’ll be counting on you!
看来只能指望你了！
What a painful cry…
这哭声...痛彻心扉。
I can’t imagine how it must feel to wake up thousands of years after the disappearance of the people you were meant to protect.
我永远无法想象，这种在本应保护的人离开数千年后才醒来的痛苦。
I realize now that I’ve only thought about how others would USE Volcanion.
我现在才意识到自身之前只顾考虑别人如何利用波尔凯尼恩了。
As a tool, a reward, or something in that vein…
将其作为工具、武器、奖励...
I haven't been seeing this creature as a living being.
它是1个活生生的个体。
I saw it as words on a page.
我却把它看作是一页文字。
Volcanion seems to be looking to you for guidance.
波尔凯尼恩似乎在等待你的指示。
Take Volcanion with you?
要带走波尔凯尼恩吗？
Nora, seeing your intent, comes over and hands you a Poké Ball.
诺拉看出了你的意图，走过来递给你1个精灵球。
The Volcanion seems to sigh in relief as it enters the ball.
波尔凯尼恩似乎在进入精灵球的一瞬间松了一口气。
Wonderful.
太好了。
Well, I guess this is where we go our separate ways, \PN.
好吧，也到我们说再见的时候了，\PN。
I hope you don’t mind, but I’m going to keep the USB you gave me.
但我会留下这个U盘，希望你不要介意。
Turning away from it all now would be to live a life knowing what passion is, but never permitting myself to experience it.
现在就这样放手，也就代表着放弃了就在眼前的，去体会激情岁月的机会。
There are other loose ends left behind by Team Chasm, the Seekers, and who knows what else that I want to see through.
我还想试着去发现更多裂隙队之前留下的痕迹。
Toodles.
回见。
Volcanion nods. It will wait for you.
波尔凯尼恩点了点头，它会在这里等你的。
I still think it’d be for the best if you took Volcanion with you.
我觉得你还是带走波尔凯尼恩吧。
I’ve spent so much time looking towards the past for answers.
花了这么长时间寻找答案...
Though, I guess I can keep them company for the time being…
起码我可以陪陪他们了。
The snow here seems to be heating up directly into steam.
这里的雪似乎被直接加热成了蒸汽。
Is this what Svait looked like before Team Chasm did what it did…?
这就是裂隙队之前在霜皑镇所做的事情吗？
The sublimation seems to be a different effect from the subthermal vents in the Svait Sauna.
这里跟霜皑镇桑拿室不同，这里的“水”并未经历过液态。
But maybe… The sources of those phenomena are the same?
但...或许源头是一致的？
Yes
带走
No

Behind me stand two sides of a similar coin – An arrogant child and a cowardly elder.
我身后站着的是一枚金钱的两面，其一是傲慢的孩子，其二是懦弱的长者。
Both too fearful to recognize the harm they cause our King of Kings.

Fear, guilt, and shame - a trinity of self-imposed suffering.
恐惧，内疚，还有羞愧 - 三位一体的自我折磨。
They stood as my lifelong companions, but no longer must they.

I hope all my numbing strategies will make you take it slow.
我希望我这些麻木的策略，能让你稍微慢下一些来。

I've been exploring Makya's for years. My dream is to take a trip to see some of tunnels under Kalos.
这么多年我一直在探索马凯亚地区的地下隧道，希望有一天能去卡洛斯看看。
For now though, I'll look at the concrete.
不过现在，还是先干好本职吧。

I caught a few extra Pokemon on my last vacation to Hoenn.
上次去丰缘度假的时候，我多抓了好几只精灵。
I don't really need 'em, but I REALLY need coffee right now.
但我不是很需要它们，我现在最需要的是一倍咖啡。
I'll trade you one for a cup. I got a Corsola and a Shuckle up for grabs.
我可以用一只太阳珊瑚或者壶壶，跟你换一杯咖啡。
Dang. Really pegged you as the type to carry around arbitrary cups of coffee.
也对，你怎么也不像会随身携带咖啡的人。
Oh yeah. That hits the spot.
好耶，直达病根！
Aite, a deal is a deal. Which 'mon are you feeling?
说到做到，你想要哪一只？
Alright. I'll be here.
好的，我平时都在这里。
All yours.
这是你的了。
Now to get through the rest of my day...
现在...我得把先完成今天的工作。
No cups? Hmm.
没有？呃...
These barrels aren't going to inspect themselves...
这些货物就不能检查好自身吗...
This plant has been running since Prizca was still mostly brick and wood.
在宏礼市还是以木屋为主的时候，这家工厂就开始运作了。
A bit interesting that there was a huge uptick in fires when Team Chasm took it over.
不过有意思的是，在裂隙队接手后，这里的生产订单瞬间飙升。
Ah well, I'm paid to think it's a coincidence.
其实我觉得这是巧合啦！
I don't even really work. I just watch the Pokemon do it.
我甚至不需要做什么，只要盯着精灵们就行。
Sometimes I go out and grab them lunch. It's boring, but the benefits are surprisingly good.
除了偶尔出去给它们买午餐...虽然无聊，但乐得清闲。
Geodude is managing the supply chain! Impressive!
小拳石正在管理供应链！
Shh, don't report me. This is the most hidden place in the city. No one ever finds me here.
嘘，别举报我！这是城里最隐蔽的地方了，这样他们就找不到我！
Plus, I can torrent whatever I want on the WiFi here.
而且还能用这里的WiFi随便下载自身喜欢的内容。
Don't give coffee.
不给。
Give coffee.
给他。
I'll choose later.
我得想想。
I'll take the Corsola.
太阳珊瑚。
I'll take the Shuckle.
壶壶。

[Map442]
There seem to be rocks in here. Does he feed this to his Pokemon?
这里好像有石头，他是在拿这个喂他的精灵？
Bence almost has a week of prepared meals in the fridge.
本斯冰箱里准备了这一周的饭菜。
One day is missing. An empty wrapper seems to have had a "Z" scribbled onto it.
有一天的伙食不见了，空包装上写着1个大大的“Z”。
Pieces of hair are at the edges of the sink. This must be where Bence trims that beard of his.
水槽边有一些掉落的碎毛发，应该是本斯刮下来的胡子。
It's an old picture book.
一本古老的图画书。
You see a few photos of Bence with a Hoppip and Alolan Geodude.
你可以看到几张本斯和毽子草以及阿罗拉小拳石的合影。
It seems like they lost a lot of Pokemon battles back then...
那时，他们负多胜少...
[Map443]
Man, that battle really tuckered me out.
我去，这一仗给我累的...
I'm not a stranger to hard work, mind you.
我的体质明明很不错的。
I went through so much coffee when I was an architect.
之前当建筑设计师的时候，经常喝咖啡加班。
I’m the one who came up with the designs for the Ranger Outposts you see all over.
护林员补给站的设计图，就是我的手笔。
Bless Bogdan Cement for their cheap prices.
还得感谢博登浇筑物美价廉的产品。
A dusty, ancient computer terminal.
一台满是灰尘的老式电脑。
"EARLY PROJECTS ARCHIVE" is displayed in big block letters at the top of the screen.
屏幕上大大的字写着：早期项目档案。
Below that, it prompts you to enter a password.
下面提示需要输入密码。
A dusty, old logbook. "Archive Catalogue" is written on the front in black marker.
一本满是灰尘的旧日志，上面有黑色记号笔写的“档案目录”。
As you approach, you overhear the men talking back and forth, complaining about the cold and the difficulty of their task.
当你走近时，无意中听到了有说话的声音，好像在抱怨这里的寒冷和任务的艰巨。
Apparently these are Kurt and Pearce, LuxTech employees.
显然是光华的员工库特和皮尔斯。
Jeez, this stuff really is ancient.
诶呀，真是个老古董。
Whose idea was it to let Tamarind name the Projects and Operation files for internal use?
让塔玛琳来给内部文件命名的馊主意到底是谁想出来的？
Her naming conventions require a thesaurus to decipher.
她用的那些词词典上都不好找！
She always was kind of a slob. Lambert was always cleaning up her messes.
而且她总是邋里邋遢的，需要兰伯特帮她收拾残局。
Speaking of, I do wonder how the chop off the old block is doing these days.
既然说到他了，也不知道那老小子最近怎么样。
Yeah, we should reach out to him sometime. Rafael too.
是啊，我们应该找机会跟他谈谈，还有拉斐尔。
We’ve both accrued too much PTO, after all. Haha.
毕竟我们积累的压力都多过头了，哈哈哈！
…Don’t you think it’s kinda odd that those two ended up as Gym Leaders?
你不觉得让他们2个当道馆馆主这件事很诡异吗？
I mean, Lambert, I kinda understand. But Rafael was primarily a scientist.
我...呃...兰伯特还能理解，但拉斐尔以前就是个研究员。
And that’s not even mentioning Noel. Who is. Noel.
哦对，还有诺埃尔...怎么想都别扭。
And we’re… here.
再就是...我们...在这儿...
And it seems we’re not the only ones here. You got something to say, or…?
看来这里不只有我们2个啊，你是有话要说...还是...
What? No!
什么？不可能！
This is a sensitive piece of machinery!
这台设备非常的珍贵！
There was a whole scrum ceremony covering this.
之前整个会议都在谈论这件事。
We can’t just give it away!
我们不可能拱手让人！
Forget the ceremony, Josh. It’s Mavis’ kid.
别管那什么会议了，这家伙是梅维斯的孩子。
So? Helena has been on our behinds for a while and we’ve already pushed this back again and again.
所以呢？海伦娜盯上我们多久了？我们已经不能再推了！
If we don’t do this now, she’ll have someone else do it.
就算我们不做，她也会派别人来的。
And I guess that makes you our "someone else."
然后我们就该 "收拾行李滚蛋"了。
If there’s something you want in this life, you have to take it.
如果你还有想要得到的东西，那就必须留下这个！
Using your own overwhelming strength.
用自身压倒性的力量。
So, you want us to hand the archive data over to you, huh?
所以，你想让我们把档案交给你，对吧？
If there’s something you want in this life, you have to take it. Using your own overwhelming strength.
如果你还有想要得到的东西，那就必须留下这个！用自身压倒性的力量。
My body’s shaking. I… How did you…?
我...我怎么...你...竟然...
I guess it really shows that you aren’t just Mavis’ kid anymore.
看来你已经不再只是“梅维斯的孩子”这么简单了。
You’re a champion. Through and through.
你配得上冠军的头衔。
I’m just glad Team Chasm’s gone.
我只是很高兴裂隙队不存在了。
Imagine if we somehow managed to win back then?
试想一下，如果当年我们赢了，那现在又会是什么样子呢？
You’d come around years later and tear what we built down. That’s horrifying.
但真的到了多年后，要将自身曾经建造的东西拆掉时，还是会感到很可怕。
Losing a fight like that reminds you of the good old days, dont’cha think, Kurt?
库特，输掉这场对决，会让你想起以前的美好时光吗？
You mean having to trudge through the lava filled chambers of an active volcano?
你是说在充满岩浆的火山洞穴中跋涉的日子吗？
Yeah, no. I’ll take my cushy office job with air conditioning any day.
哈，我才不觉得那美好，还是让我坐在办公室里吹空调吧。
But, a win’s a win, so here ya go…
总之输了就是输了，给你...
This thing is filled with early Chasm data.
这里面是裂隙队早期的数据。
When you get the chance, take a look at "Project Chrysopoeia Albedo".
如果你感兴趣的话，可以看看"莹润金成计划"。
I remember that one causing the eggheads a lot of pain.
我记得那次大家都吃了不少苦头。
The ritual to capture the target required a flute that was excavated much later on, in a place no one would ever think to find it.
我们当时需要一支特殊的笛子，来完成捕捉目标的仪式，后来是在1个完全想不到的地方，挖到这个宝贝的。
By that time, there wasn’t a pressing need for that whole song and dance.
但那个时候已经不需要它了，也不再需要那个仪式。
Not with something like Yezera keeping us on our toes.
它并不像叶泽拉那样，让我们不得不时刻绷紧神经。
You really gave it your all in that battle.
可以说是拼尽全力了。
It made me realize that I haven’t been giving mine here.
如果只是如此我还没有在这里献爱心的必要性。
Think I’m going to give my two weeks’ notice to Helena. Try my hand at being a Pro Trainer.
我想试着提前预约海伦娜的挑战，试试当精英训练师的感觉。
Can you give me that?
能把这个给我吗？
No.
没啥要说的。
[Map444]

[Map445]
It hurriedly gestures for you to enter the chamber ahead.
它连忙示意你进入面前的密室。
[Map446]
[Map447]
I'm sorry... for what I must do.
我很抱歉...我必须做这些。
AH!
啊！
What?! What are you doing?!
什么？！你在做什么？！
I know you, \PN... I know that you will defeat me in a fair battle.
我认识你，\PN...我知道你会在一场公平的战斗中打败我。
Therefore... I will use three Pokemon on my side, and you will use only two.
所以...我将使用三只精灵，而你只能使用两只。
If you do not agree to this, my Pokemon will attack Jovan.
如果你不同意，我的精灵就会攻击约凡。
I should have known. It's just like you to attack civilians!
我早该知道。你果然会攻击平民！
I'll never forget what you did... what you made me a part of...
我永远不会忘记你做过的事...你让我参与其中的事...
Velenz weeps because of you and your Pokemon.
夜幽市因为你的精灵而哭泣。
Tch.
啧。
Let us begin.
让我们开始吧。
*sigh*
*叹气*
What a tragedy.
真是悲剧。
Finally...

Micah is a real piece of work. Thank you.

Thank you for being strong enough to best him.

The ritual is progressing! Hold on to whatever you can!

Urgh!
呃！
Good girl, Michi!
好样的，米奇！
That was some speed!
那速度真快！
That was—
那是——
Like the old days...
就像往昔...
We haven't gone on a lot of adventures lately, have we...?
我们最近没怎么去冒险，是吧……？
Not since...
自从...
I've never told anyone this story before...
我从没跟别人讲过这个故事……
When I joined Team Chasm, I thought I could take on anything and everything.
我加入裂隙队的时候，我以为我能应对一切。
Explore interesting places. Learn the secrets of Makya. Experiment and invent the technologies of the future.
探索有趣的地方。了解马凯亚的秘密。尝试和发明未来的技术。
But those days didn't last. Before long it wasn't bright-eyed scientists that Team Chasm needed, but enforcers...
但那些日子并没有持续太久。不久，裂谷队需要的就不是充满热情的科学家，而是执行者...
Go guard our logging operations, go intimidate a contractor, go destroy an escaped experiment...
去守卫我们的伐木作业，去恐吓1个承包商，去破坏1个逃脱的实验...
I struggled to keep up.
我努力跟上。
I took an embarassing loss... a young girl with only a single gym badge.
我遭受了一场尴尬的失败...1个只有一枚道馆徽章的年轻女孩。
They never let me live it down.
他们从未放过我。
The bullying continued until I quit.
欺凌一直持续到我辞职。
Which was... quite a while. I didn't quit until....
这...过了很久。我直到...才辞职。
Let's not talk about that.
我们别提那个了。
Michi was my friend... who stuck with me throughout it all.
米奇是我的朋友...她一直陪伴着我。
I have no skill at battling. I accept that...
我不擅长战斗。我接受这一点...
But I...
但我...
I'm sorry. I'm distracting us from the MUCH more important problem.
我很抱歉。我让我们偏离了更重要的问题。
The Drillers... I can see them to our North.
钻工队...我看到他们在我们的北方。
They're about to attack the genies!
他们正要攻击精灵！
They seem to be performing some sort of ritual.
他们似乎正在举行某种仪式。
I... I will... I will stay here. I cannot help you with battling them.
我...我会...我会留在这里。我无法帮你与他们战斗。
You've beaten them before, so I trust that you can do it again.
你之前打败过他们，所以我相信你能再次做到。
But still, good luck.

It’s Michi, the Tropius.

She seems annoyed by the lack of vegetation.

You've got this in the bag.
你稳操胜券。
Show Micah that he can't keep making the same mistakes.
让米迦知道他不能一直犯同样的错误。
And here you are.
而你在这里。
I'll admit, you show tenacity.
我承认，你很有韧性。
Defeating us in the Oasis System, then following us here...
在绿洲系统打败我们，然后又跟到这里...
Still, you won't be enough to stop us.
然而，你还不足以阻止我们。
We won't be conquerered by your greed... by your ego...
我们不会被你们的贪婪...你们的自负...征服...
You take that BACK!
你收回那句话！
<i>You're</i> the one with ego.
<i>你</i>才是那个有自负的人。
Jovan? Really?
约凡？真的？
You of all people should know not to interfere with our operations.
你比任何人都应该知道不要干涉我们的行动。
You understand how weak you are.
你明白自身有多弱。
Stow your lies, Micah.
收起你的谎言，米迦。
I don't <i>need</i> to be stronger than you. \PN has that handled.
我不<i>需要</i>比你更强。\PN会处理的。
I know <i>you</i>. We're going to stop you.
我认识<i>你</i>。我们会阻止你。
Latching onto someone greater than you, I see?
我明白了，你是想攀附比我强大的人？
It won't make a difference. The Drillers have learned from our mistakes.
这不会有什么不同。钻工队已经从我们的错误中吸取了教训。
We won't be humiliated ever again.
我们再也不会被羞辱了。
We have the strength. We can keep Makya safe.

Drillers! Give no ground!

I've got you. Let me heal your team.

I've committed the same sin. Seek redemption with me, here and now.
我也犯了同样的罪。和我一起在这里寻求救赎吧。
You did it! I still can't believe how skilled you are.
你做到了！我仍然不敢相信你有多厉害。
Drillers!
钻工队！
I'll handle this next part myself.
接下来的部分我自身来处理。
Retreat to Circuit Station.

超能力强化的肌肉使双臂可延伸十英尺，握力足以碾碎钛金属。
The DNA from the original Mew has grown exponentially in this form. It has gained enough psychic power to control the minds of even the strongest willed people.
梦幻原始DNA在此形态呈指数级增长，获得的精神力甚至能操控意志最坚定者的思维。
It differs from other Basculin in several respects, including demeanor. It is much gentler than other color variants.
此精灵具有多项野蛮鲈鱼的特征，虽然有性情温驯等不同点存在，本人仍将其定义为野蛮鲈鱼的地区形态。
This form also exists to test the PBS Extensions feature.

战斗中，速度更大的精灵可以率先行动，但有些技能可以改变行动顺序，速度相等时随机决定先后。
Attacking vs Status
攻击与变化

大多数技能只针对单一目标，但也有很多带有群攻能力的技能，很多有与目标距离限制的技能，这些在双打、三打中会起到不同效果。
Move Types
技能属性

Accuracy is a move's chance of hitting. Most moves have 100% accuracy. Some effects can raise accuracy to let you use low-accuracy moves consistently.
大多数技能的命中率都是100%，游戏中同时有增加命中的方式，确保低命中的技能也能产生效果。
Power Points
PP
Power Points, or PP, is a number which limits how many times a move can be used. Healing at a PokéCenter, after a trainer battle or with the Aid Kit restores PP.
技能点数（PP）是1个限制技能使用次数的数字。在精灵中心治疗、训练师战斗后或使用急救包可以恢复PP。
Each Pokémon has type weakness and type resistances based on its own type. eg. Water deals double damage to Fire, and Fire deals half damage to Water.
每种精灵都有基于自身属性的弱点和抗性，如火弱水，水抗火。
Type Combinations
属性组合
When a Pokémon has two types, its type weaknesses and resistances multiply. A Pokémon can be double weak or double resistant, or immune even though one of their types is weak.
当精灵有两种属性时，它的弱点和抗性就会相互叠加，因此有可能会有非常克制或非常惧怕的属性。

无效的技能不会造成任何伤害，只要精灵拥有1个免疫对方的属性，即可生效。
Looking Up Matchups
对战情况
The 5th and 6th pages of a MasterDex entry show that Pokémon's type matchups. Open the MasterDex in battle to check matchups if you're not sure.

Why Get More?
需培养更多？
Having choices of Pokémon is important when facing challenges. A team of six is a bare minimum--it's best to catch more and pull them from the PC as needed.
每种精灵都有根据自身的属性确定的弱点，因此在应对特定对手时，最好更改队伍配置。
Methods of Aquiring
精灵获取
The three main methods of acquiring Pokémon are using DexNav, catching them from the wild, and receiving them from other Trainers through gifts or trades.
获取精灵的三种主要方法是使用导航、从野外捕捉以及通过礼物或交易从其他训练师那里接收。
Catching Basics
捕捉常识
Wild Pokémon will attack you if you walk through patches of grass, dark ground in caves, or other wild terrain. You can catch these Pokémon by throwing Poké Balls at them.
在草丛、洞穴中的黑色地板或者其他特殊地形时，就会遇到野生精灵，可以通过向它们扔精灵球的方式将其捕获。
Increase Catch Chance pt. 1
捕获率 上
Catching a Pokémon isn't guaranteed. It's easier to catch Pokémon when their health has been lowered by your attacks, or when they have a status ailment.
当野生精灵的HP被减小，或者受到异常状态影响后，就能更轻松地捉住它们了。
Increase Catch Chance pt. 2
捕获率 下
Every time a Pokémon breaks out of a ball, it'll be slightly easier to catch for the rest of the battle. You can check what your current catch chance is in the Poké Ball menu.
每当精灵从球里出来，它的捕捉率都会进一步增加，而且可以在精灵球的菜单中查看捕捉概率。
Finding Wild Pokémon
寻找野生精灵
Use the DexNav to get information on which Pokémon are available where you are.
使用导航获取你所在位置可用的精灵信息。
Trades
交换
Throughout the world there will be people offering trades for Pokémon. Usually they want a different Pokémon, but sometimes they want money.
世界各地都会有愿意交换精灵的人，只要将打算交换的精灵放在箱子中，就可以与他们交换了。
What are Stats?
什么是能力值？
Stats, short for Statistics, are the numbers which determine how your Pokémon performs in battle.
能力值决定着你的精灵在战斗中的能力表现，以数字形式展示。
Checking Stats
查看能力值
Check your Pokémon's stats by looking at the second page of their summary screen, accessible through the Pokémon menu in the pause menu.
在战斗中可以通过详情菜单，查看战斗时的数据统计。
Stat Factors
统计要素
Your Pokémon's stats are calculated from a combination of their species' 'Base Stats', their own 'Style Points', and extra modifications during battle.
精灵的能力是根据其基础能力、风格点数和战斗中额外获得的修正等级综合算出的。
Base Stats
基本能力值
Every species of Pokémon have base stats, which affect every Pokémon of that species. e.g. Every Raichu will be fast because the Raichu species has a high Speed base stat.
每种精灵都有自身的基础能力，这 些能力会影响该种族的所有精灵。
Style Points
风格点
Style Points are numbers which you can customize to change your Pokémon's stats. Style Points show as blue numbers on the stat page of the summary.
风格点是一种可以自定义精灵属性的玩法，在精灵界面的信息当中，会以蓝色字体显示出来。
Leveling and Evolution
等级与进化
Your Pokémon's stats will increase every time they level up. When Pokémon evolve, their stats change (almost always they increase).
精灵每次升级时，能力值都会增加，进化时增加的更多。
Accuracy and Evasion
命中和回避
Accuracy and Evasion are two stats which are only active in battle, starting at 100% each. They are only modified by in-battle changing effects.
命中和回避能力等级只在战斗中有效，初始均为100%，只会被战斗中的效果改变。
Stat Steps
能力等级
Effects can modify a Pokémon's stats during battle. These are called 'stat steps'. Stat steps multiply or divide the Pokémon's listed stat value.
你可以在战斗中使用变化类技能增加精灵的能力等级，或减小对手的能力等级。
Bounds of Stat Steps
能力等级升降范围
Stat steps start at 0, and can increase up to +12 (4x) and down to -12 (.25x). Stat steps are usually reset if you swap the Pokémon out or it faints.
能力等级从0开始，可以增加到+12（4倍）和减小到-12（0.25倍）。除了自然恢复外，如果交换精灵或它濒死，能力等级通常也会重置。
Checking Stat Steps
检查当前升降
You can check the current stat steps of each Pokémon on the battlefield using the Info button. It lists the numerical step as well as resultant multiplier.
你可以使用战斗中的信息功能，查看战场中的情况，以及精灵的能力值状态。
What are abilities?
特性是什么？
Abilities are special powers that Pokémon can have based on their species. Most Pokémon can have 2 possible abilities. All abilities activate in battle or in the field.
特性是精灵根据其种类可以拥有的特殊能力。大多数精灵可以有2种可能的特性。所有特性在战斗或野外都会激活。
Ability Effects
特性效果
Abilities do a wide variety of different things. Understanding your team's abilities is important to winning.
特性可以做各种不同的事情。了解你的队伍的特性对于获胜很重要。
Checking Abilities
查看特性

查看你的精灵的摘要，看看它们的主特性是什么。在战斗中使用大师图鉴了解敌方精灵的特性。
Choosing Abilities
选择特性
A Pokémon's default main ability is one of the two its species can have, randomly chosen when you get it. You can use Ability Capsules to swap to the other.
精灵的默认主特性是其种类可以拥有的两种特性之一，在你获得它时随机选择。你可以使用特性胶囊来切换到另一种。
Conditional Abilities
条件限制特性
Many abilities only do things under certain circumstances. Building around Weather and Room-synergy abilities is a common strategy.
有些特性只在特殊情况下才能发挥作用，其中最常见的是天气或空间限制。
Effect Of Evolution
进化的影响
A Pokémon's ability tends to stay the same when evolving, but can change. When this happens, the game will alert you.
精灵的特性在进化时通常是不变的，但也有特殊情况，在发生变化时游戏会给予提示。
Defeating Abilities
打倒特性
An enemy Trainer's ability too much? Abilities like Neutralizing Gas, and moves like Gastro Acid, can suppress abilities in battle.
训练师的战斗力太强了？可以使用一些特定的特性或技能来限制他们的能力。
Swapping Abilities
交换特性
Moves like Skill Swap can be used to give a new ability to Pokémon during battle, enabling unique and creative team synergies.
某些技能和效果可以和对方交换特性，比如技能特性互换。
What are Held Items?
携带物品？
Held items are items which you can give your Pokémon to benefit them during battle. They can increase their damage, heal them, or other things.
可以通过携带一些可以在战斗中使用的物品，增加精灵战斗中的表现。
Equipping an item
携带1个物品
You can give a Pokémon an item from your bag, or through the summary screen. Not all items do an effect when held, so read carefully.
你可以通过背包或精灵菜单给它们携带物品，并不是所有物品携带后都对战斗有所帮助，请仔细阅读。
Berries
树果
Berries are a common held item. During battles, Pokémon will eat the berry to get a benefit. Get berries by picking from Berry Trees.
树果是一种很常见的携带物品，精灵于战斗中会在合适的时候吃掉树果。
Sitrus and Cado Berry
文柚果和净馨果
Sitrus Berry and Cado Berry are common berries which heal your Pokémon when at low health. If in doubt about what item to give a Pokémon, give them one of these.
文柚果和味美果可以在精灵体力较少时触发，并恢复它们的HP，如果不知道该携带些什么，可以选择它们。
Rematerializer
重塑打印机
In Pokémon Tectonic, the Rematerializer regenerates held items which are consumed in battle. You'll never run out of berries!
在游戏中，重塑打印机可以将战斗中消耗的物品再生，因此永远不用担心会把树果用完。
Wild Held Items
野生携带物品
Wild Pokémon can be found holding items. These items sometimes have held effects, but often don't.
野生精灵也会携带物品，这些物品通常没有携带效果，但部分未必。
Getting More

You will find more held items on the ground when traveling, or as gifts from people, or as the reward for defeating Avatars, or as purchasable items in shops.
在旅行途中，你会捡到很多可携带的物品，人们也会赠送给你一些礼物，打倒化身也能得到物品奖励，商店中也可以购买一部分。
What are Status Conditions?
异常状态
Status Conditions are ailments a Pokémon can have which hurt or restrict them. They remain after swapping out, and even between battles.
精灵可能在战斗中被异常状态干扰，即便离开战场异常状态也不会消失。
Healing Status Conditions

每个部族提供的奖励各不相同，通过精心搭配你的队伍，可以同时激活多个部族的效果！
Are they important?
部族重要性
Tribes are not required in any way to complete the game. They are simply an alternative team-building challenge to play with, like Single Type runs.

Ah, to be on solid ground again. Away from Galar's suffocating industrial sprawl. Stable. Connected. Tranquil. No cold steel shifting and rocking beneath my feet. No stench of smoke and oil to burn my lungs.
啊，又踏上了坚实的土地，远离了伽勒尔那令人窒息的工厂，这种令人安心的稳定，紧密与宁静，没有冰冷的钢铁在我脚下晃动，也没有灼人肺腑的恶臭油烟。
Just me, my companion, and Makya.
只有我，我的队友，还有马凯亚。
May 22nd
5月22日
I wonder if it's just me. So sentimental and wistful over little things I thought I knew. Is nostalgia tainting my perceptions? Or is the world truly as broken as it looks?
我不知道这是不是我的错觉，我总对一些自以为熟悉的小事而惆怅，这种怀念与多愁善感...是这份怀念玷污了我的认知，还是这个世界真的已经支离破碎？
My new friend makes me expect the latter. A sad story. But... inspiring nonetheless. Maybe I'll meet them again someday.
我的新朋友让我更希望是后者，那是1个悲伤的故事，但...它也同样鼓舞人心，或许还会有一天再见到他们。

5月26日
Life. Not just Life as life – Life as creation. Life as energy. Life as imagination, and falsehood, and memory, and motion. Over six days in Makya, this is the one place that seems to be governed by Life... and not its negation.
生命，不仅仅是生命的生命-作为创造的生命，作为能量的生命，是虚妄，是记忆，是变化...在马凯亚的这6天时间，这里似乎是1个由生命支配的地方，而不是被生命所否定...
The world is dead. And Makya stands as little more than a polished mirror. What a shame.
世界已死，而马凯亚，只不过是一面被擦亮的镜子而已，真是遗憾。

I left last night when the earth began to rumble. I only returned for my companion, despite my... reservations.

A great pit separates me from yesterday's memories. A dozen blackened eyes study my every step.
1个巨大的深坑将我与昨日的记忆隔开，十几双漆黑的眼睛注视着我的每一步。
What's done is done.
木已成舟...

At every turn, a set of eyes. On every perch, a silver scout. But... surely they cannot see everywhere? My friend at the Monument seemed to imply as much.
每1个转弯，都有一双眼睛，每一处栖息地，都有个银色的斥候...但是，它们肯定不能看到每个角落吧？我在纪念碑的朋友似乎也在暗示我。
But with every step I take, I find a new reason to check over my shoulder. Whether it's guilt or fear that guides me to that great tower... well. I'd rather not dwell on that yet.
但我每走一步，都会找到新的理由来检查我的肩膀，究竟是内疚，还是恐惧，指引我走向了那座高塔...算了，还是先不想这些了。

This was a mistake. This was <i>all</i> a mistake...
这是1个谬误！这全部的一切<i>都</i>是谬误...
A set of silver eyes rests atop Carnation Tower today. I couldn't shake the feeling that it expected me... He must know I stole His reign. Nothing makes sense if He doesn't.
今天，康乃馨塔顶上的银色眼睛...我无法摆脱这种被祂等待的感觉...祂一定知道我窃取了它的全能，只有这样...只有这样一切才说得通。
To anyone reading this, I urge you: Speak to my friend at the Monument. As long as He stands without rule, we can act without fear.
读到这里的人啊，我敦促你们：去和我那在纪念碑的朋友谈谈吧，只要他屹立不倒，我们就能无所畏惧。

Tomorrow. All of this ends tomorrow morning.

My best hope of escaping His grasp... but I can tell we're not moving anymore.

Nobody seems to believe me. We can't even see the waves! And I've heard four hooves circling my bed for hours...

Land, sea, sky, and shining o’er all: victory, yours evermore. Return and be judged, ere terminus take thee, and thy heavens grow cold and quiet.</i>
<i>审判，仍在等待，审判，由君执掌。十3个选中的人，被钢铁紧紧束缚，学生，巫师，四大守护者，茂密的丛林，闪耀的月亮，陆地，海洋，天空，一切无不闪耀：最终胜利...永远只属于你。回来吧，接受审判吧，在终点站将你带走之前，你的天堂将变得冰冷而宁静。</i>
There’s a crude drawing of a Togekiss scratched into the soft stone. Beneath it is a long, cramped inscription that seems to be nonsense:

Which entry would you like to read?
你想阅读哪一项？
Everything on your team needs a point. Every Pokémon needs a purpose.
你队伍中的每一只精灵都需要1个目标。每一只精灵都需要1个存在的意义。
If you can't sum up its role on your team in a sentence, keep it in the PC.
如果你不能用一句话概括它在队伍中的角色，就把它留在电脑里。
Every bit of that Pokémon should reinforce its role. Moves, items, everything.
那只精灵的每1个方面都应该强化它的角色。技能、物品，一切。
All six Pokémon on your team need a role, narrow or broad.
你队伍中的六只精灵都需要1个角色，无论这个角色是狭窄还是宽泛。
Two Pokémon with synergistic roles are called a "core."
两只具有协同作用的精灵被称为1个“核心”。
If the two of them can take hits from a whole bunch of things, that's a defensive core.
如果它们能够承受来自许多不同攻击的伤害，这就是1个防御核心。
If together they threaten lots of Pokémon and deal with each others' counters, that's an offensive core.
如果它们一起对许多精灵构成威胁并处理彼此的对策，这就是1个进攻核心。
Combine both and you have a balanced core. Good cores make for powerful teams.
将两者结合，你就有了1个平衡的核心。强大的核心造就强大的队伍。
You don't need them, but they're a surefire way to give your team some bite.
你不需要它们，但它们是让你的队伍更具攻击的可靠方法。
The Pokémon you start a fight with is your "lead."
你开始战斗时使用的精灵就是你的“首发精灵”。
Start every fight with it and it's a "dedicated lead." Make it a good one.
如果你每次都用它来开始战斗，那么它就是1个“专用首发精灵”。让它成为1个好的首发精灵。
Its job is to kick things off in your favor from round one.
它的任务是从第1回合开始就为你创造有利的局面。
Usually that's by vomiting up a whole bunch of hazards. Sometimes it sets screens and explodes.
通常这是通过吐出一大堆场地不利因素来实现的。有时候它会设置屏障类效果然后自爆。
A few just try to delete whatever's on the other side, usually with short-term power boosts like Gems.
有些则试图直接消灭对方的精灵，通常会使用像宝石这样的短期力量增加。
Speaking of which, your opponent is going to have their own lead.
说到这个，你的对手也会有自身的首发精灵。
Stop it. Taunt it, put it to sleep, or put it in the ground.
阻止它。挑衅它，让它入睡，或者让它陷入地面。
The arena is going to very rapidly fill up with nasty pointy things.
锦标赛场很快就会布满讨厌的尖锐物体。
That's because wasting a turn setting them up in the short term pays off big in the long term when they chew up a few Pokémon worth of health over the course of the match.
这是因为，从长远来看，当这些场地不利因素在比赛中消耗掉几只精灵的健康时，前期花费1回合来设置它们是非常值得的。
If you like being alive, pack something that can clean up hazards – Defog, Terraform, or Rapid Spin, usually.
如果你喜欢保持健康，那就带上一些能够清除场地不利因素的东西——通常是除雾、搅土翻壤或高速旋转。
Stealth Rocks are the most common hazard, so prioritize hazard removal if you've got lots of Rock-weak Pokémon.
隐型岩是最常见的场地不利因素，所以如果你有很多岩石属性弱点的精灵，就优先清除场地不利因素。
Remember: if your favorite little gremlin is switching out nine times a match or is cripplingly weak to funny pebbles, put Heavy-Duty Boots on it.
记住：如果你最喜欢的那只小妖精在一场比赛中切换了九次，或者对那些奇怪的小石头异常脆弱，就给它穿上重型靴子。
They're cute and effective.
它们既可爱又有效。
You exit the PC.
你退出了电脑。

Even keel
保持平衡

Rolling with the punches

All the little pieces of your team need their own role.
你队伍中的每1个小部分都需要有自身的角色。
Use whatever you want; just ensure that it's got something to do and the best odds of doing it.
使用任何你想要的；只要确保它有事情要做，并且有最好的机会去做。
Give bulky Pokémon Leftovers and healing moves.
给耐久型精灵携带剩饭和治疗技能。
Give strong, slow Pokémon Focus Sashes, Vests, or ways to speed up.
给强大但速度慢的精灵携带焦点披带、护符或加速的方法。
You get the idea.
你明白我的意思。
If you can, try to have all kinds of Pokémon on your team, so you have answers to anything.
如果可以的话，尽量让你的队伍中有各种各样的精灵，这样你就能应对任何情况。
Physical and special bulk and power, type matchups, speed profiles – a diverse team is a diverse toolbox.
物理和特殊耐久、力量、属性克制、速度配置——1个多样化的队伍就是1个多样化的工具箱。
Send out the Pokémon that helps everything else on your team first.
先派出能帮助队伍中其他精灵的精灵。
If you have a weather or a Room to set up, get to it.
如果你有天气或场地要设置，那就去做吧。
If you don't have a clear, clean gameplan, ruin your opponent's.
如果你没有1个清晰、干净的游戏计划，那就破坏对手的。
A dedicated lead's worst fear is usually a strong multi-hitting move. Neither Sturdy nor Sash can help them there.
1个专注的首发精灵最害怕的通常是强力的多段伤害类技能。坚固和披带都无法帮助他们。
As opposed to simply trading hazards, outspeeding and KOing a lead before it gets going can give you an early advantage.
与简单地交换场地不利因素相比，在首发精灵开始行动之前，通过速度优势将其打倒可以给你带来早期优势。
Each Pokémon's utility is defined by the opponent.
每只精灵的实用性都是由对手定义的。
If your opponent has several Fire-type Pokémon, your Primarina is far more valuable.
如果对手有几只火属性精灵，你的西施海壬就更有价值了。
Conserve its health and leverage its power.
保存它的体力并发挥它的力量。
In the same match, an Aegislash may be far less valuable – be willing to sacrifice it.
在同一场比赛中，阿罗拉盾甲龙可能就没那么有价值了——要愿意牺牲它。
There's no shame in letting a Pokémon fall in order to get a safe switch to another.
为了安全地切换到另一只精灵，让一只精灵倒下并没有什么可耻的。
While they may seem drastic, moves such as Healing Wish or Explosion can turn the tide of a match in a single turn.
虽然它们看起来很极端，但像治愈愿望或自爆这样的技能可以在1回合内扭转比赛的局面。
Fainting the user can, if used with finesse, be an advantage – think of them as the ultimate U-Turn.
如果使用得当，让使用者濒死可以是1个优势——把它们当作终极的极速折返。
The Corviknight stares at you intently.
钢铠鸦正在盯着你。
You get the sense that you've failed some sort of test.
你感觉自身没能通过某种测试。

Which section would you like to read?
要阅读哪一部分？
Tapu Lele's ability "Flutter Totem" creates a "Cruel Cocoon" upon entry that only affects its side and lasts for 6 turns.
卡璞·蝶蝶的特性“翩翩图腾”，会在进入战斗时制造1个持续6回合，且只影响己方的“残酷之茧”。
At the end of each turn, it heals Pokémon on its side by 1/8th of their max HP.
在每个回合结束时，它会恢复其同侧精灵最大HP的1/8。
However, they also lose 1 PP from each of their moves. Cruel indeed.
但这也会让所有技能的PP减小，这就是其残酷的地方。
Tapu Koko's ability "Storm Totem" creates a "Turbulent Sky" upon entry that only affects its side and lasts for 6 turns.
卡璞·鸣鸣的特性“暴风图腾”，会在进入战斗时制造1个持续6回合，且只影响己方的“动荡之空”。
Pokémon on its side get a 30% move damage boost, but they are prevented from using moves that are the same type as the move they most recently used.
其同侧的精灵获得30%的技能伤害增加，但他们无法使用与最近使用的技能相同属性的技能。
Or, to state it another way, they can't use the same move type twice in a row.
只要上回合使用了某种属性的技能，下回合同属性就会被禁止。
Tapu Bulu's ability "Wild Totem" creates a "Primal Forest" upon entry that only affects its side and lasts for 6 turns.
卡璞·哞哞的特性“荒野图腾”，会在进入战斗时制造1个持续6回合，且只影响己方的“原始之森”。
Whenever a Pokémon on its side is hit by an offensive attack, it becomes enraged.
每当其同侧的精灵被攻击命中时，它会陷入狂暴状态。
Thereby, its defense stats are both lowered by 1 step and its attack stats are both raised by 1 step.
这会使其减小自身的双防， 但增加自身的双攻。
Tapu Fini's ability "Fog Totem" creates a "Misdirecting Fog" upon entry that only affects its side and lasts for 6 turns.
卡璞·鳍鳍的特性“迷雾图腾”，会在进入战斗时制造1个持续6回合，且只影响己方的“迷惑之雾”。
Whenever a foe finishes attacking a Pokémon on its side, the attacker is forced to switch out of battle.
每当敌方攻击其同侧的精灵后，攻击者会被迫替换出战斗。
Unlike moves such as Roar or Whirlwind, however, the trainer has enough time to select the replacement themselves.
不过跟吼叫之类的技能不同，对方可以自行选择要上场的精灵。
You put down the book.
你放下这个本子。
Think you can handle whatever strategy I'm hiding?

Get ready to unravel the enigma of my team. Will it be a treat or a trick?

Warning! Battling me may cause trembling, excessive sweating, and a memorable defeat.

No point in saying much. I've come to expect this sort of performance from you.

I'll try to laugh about that loss. It's the best medicine, right?

Well, at least I'll be known for being a unique individual.
好吧，至少我会以独特的个性而出名。
I must confess, you're like a puzzle I just can't solve. Kudos for the mind games!
我必须承认，你就像我解不开的谜题，必须为你的聪明才智点赞！
Ouch! That defeat hit harder than a Hyper Beam.
诶哟，这一击比破坏死光还猛！
Defeat stings like a Poison Jab to the heart. Time to reevaluate my strategy and lick my wounds.
失败就像毒刺一样伤着我的心，是时候舔舔伤口，重置战略了。
You've shown me the true meaning of humiliation. Frankly, it does stink.

Sometimes I regret deciding to never use held items.

The surprise play must have worked, since I took some of yours down with me!
出其不意的战术奏效了，毕竟我也得到了一些成果！
Oh, well, my perfect plan went awry. Time to recalculate.
好吧，我的完美计划出了差错，是时候重新计算了。
Defeat? No worries, I'll just add it to my collection of almost-perfect victories!

Bravo! Your team concoction was like a spicy curry that set my taste buds on fire.
太棒了，你的队伍就像辛辣的咖喱，让我的味蕾受到火热的炙烤。
\PN, your battles are a roller coaster of emotions.
\PN, 与你战斗就像过山车一样，起起伏伏，情绪不定。
Sometimes even the best fall short. I'll dust myself off and try again!
有时，最优秀的人也会失败，我会重新振作，再试1次！
Looks like you're still a worthy rival!
看来你是个值得尊敬的对手！
Well, that was a close call! My heart was pounding with each move.
真是千钧一发啊！每一步都让我心脏狂跳。
I gave it my all, but luck wasn't on my side. At least I'm gonna blame that one on luck.
我全力以赴了， 但运气不在我这边，至少这把就是运气的事。
A loss? How unexpected! It's not like I meticulously planned for this scenario.
