即時新聞！
I'm live here at <imp>Tri Island</imp>, a mysterious island discovered recently off the coast of Makya.
最近在馬凱亞附近的海域，發現了一座新的島嶼，我現在就在這座<imp>三相島</imp>。
Trainers from all over the world are making their way over as there have been sightings of extremely rare Pokemon and resources.
因為這裡發現了極其罕見的精靈，目前世界各地都有訓練家向此地進發。
With no region claiming major jurisdiction over the island, there have been reports of multiple factions creating base camps in the area.
由於目前沒有任何一個地區，對此島嶼宣稱了主權，因此很多派別都於島上建立了營地。
The only thing that's certain here is the battling as Trainers duke it out over territory and access to these new wild areas.
我們目前唯一可以確定的是，這裡的訓練家們會為了爭奪領地，進入這片新世界而展開戰鬥。
But for now, we'll be providing live coverage of the event. Over and out.
這次的報道到此結束，謝謝大家的收看。
Uh -- yes? Did you want to ask me something?
啊...那個，你想問我什麼嗎？
Well then don't -- can you not -- I'm not a big fan of being stared at.
那你...能不能...不要這樣...一直盯著我看？我...不喜歡這樣。
I just like... I’m a wanderer. Or, rather, not a wanderer -- but I don't have a home -- or, well -- excuse me. I spend most of my time in caves.
我只是喜歡...我...是個流浪者。或者說...不是流浪...只是...我沒有家...我...抱歉，大部分時間...我都待在山洞裡。
I don't know? I mean -- no, I know, but rather I'm not sure why -- I mean, what kind of question is that? I'm a Pokémon trainer.
我不知道...不是，我是說...我知道...但是我不確定...不對，這是個什麼問題？我是個精靈訓練家。
Or I was. And I’m... rather good at it. And not much else.
或者說以前是...並且我...擅長這個。並且...其他方面不行。
A friend's. Just a friend's. I'm good at -- they entrust me with the training. I get results.
一個朋友的，只是朋友...我...擅長...所以他們...委託我幫忙訓練...我...有成績。
I mean, that sounds -- that's not what I really meant. I'm -- I'm -- I was -- let's move on.
我是說，這...不是我的想法...我...我...我...繼續前進吧。
Heyo, \PN. Hear you’ve been busy.
喂，\PN，聽說你很忙。
You’re just racking up badges like they’re nothing, huh? Mavis must be so proud.
你不會徽章都能堆成小山了吧？哈，梅維斯肯定會為你驕傲的。
It’s not a compliment. Just stating the facts.
這不是恭維，陳述事實而已。
And the fact is that you’re not getting anywhere now unless you come meet me, for reasons that make me too angry to explain.
但現在的情況是，你得來見我，不然你哪兒也去不了，至於原因，讓我氣得解釋不了。
I’ve got a <imp>gift</imp> for you.
我會給你帶一份<imp>禮物</imp>。
I’m literally friends with two - I mean ONE - of those gym leaders, and I was the commanding officer for half the people keeping track of Rafael.
我跟其中兩個...或者說一個道館館主是朋友關係，剛想到的另一個朋友，是拉斐爾身邊的義軍隊長。
Word gets around.
所以消息來得很快。
I also know that you’re gonna have some issues getting <imp>across that river</imp> without my help.
而且我清楚，如果沒有我的幫助，你沒有可以<imp>過河</imp>的方法。
Yikes.
啊。
Yeah, Mavis is… Mavis.
也對，梅維斯...是那個梅維斯。
You know, you… ah, nevermind. Eye on the prize and all that.
你知道你...啊，算了，總之你應該想要獎品吧。
Speaking of which, you need to get <imp>across the river</imp>, yeah?
你現在是不是在為<imp>過河</imp>的事發愁？
We might be able to reach an arrangement...
或許你可以試試完成我的安排...
But. But... you know how this works.
不過...我得先說清楚需要做什麼。
Quid pro quo, yeah? I know you’ve scratched a few avatars off of my hit list.
這算是交換條件？我知道你已經幫我把幾個化身，從我的“追殺名單”上劃掉了。
Gonna be clear as crystal here: you’re doing better than most of the rangers.
這讓我不得不說一句：你比大部分義軍做得更好。
Such as the ones that recently just got mauled by a particularly ornery Steelix avatar.
比如某個最近剛被大鋼蛇化身狠揍了一頓的人。
You know me so well. Put the thing in the ground – well, more in the ground.
你看來很懂我啊，把那個東西塞進地底...最好是塞進地心！
It’s ripping through the mine yard in <imp>Grouz</imp> at the moment, which is… a problem.
它現在正在<imp>古治鎮</imp>的礦場裡肆虐，這是個絕對的大麻煩。
If it goes down particular routes we could be facing a VERY uncomfortable situation.
如果它繼續這樣鬧下去，我們會陷入非常糟糕的局面。
The rangers? Dealing with rampaging Tauros and crossroads hauntings.
你說義軍？處理狂奔的肯泰羅和十字路口的幽靈。
Avatars are out of their paygrade. Not that we don’t send them in anyways and hope for the best.
化身並不屬於他們的工作範疇，當然也不是說完全不管，只是他們並不擅長做這些。
Speaking of which: <imp>Grouz</imp>. Squad went out and didn’t leave a scratch on the damn thing.
說到這裡：<imp>古治鎮</imp>那邊，義軍小隊也跟化身打了，但連一點劃痕都沒能造成。
You can split it right open, though, yeah?
你應該能解決掉它吧？
You don’t know what busy looks like, kid. You think I’m not trying to work here?
你知道真正的忙碌是什麼嗎？孩子，要不我們換換工作？
I know you cut a deal with Helena. Same here: you accelerate my timetable, I do the same for you.
我知道你跟海倫娜達成了協議，我這邊也一樣，你幫我，我也會幫你加快進度。
So make your way down to <imp>Grouz</imp> and turn that Steelix to slag. Please?
所以，去<imp>古治鎮</imp>把那個鋼鐵巨蟲轟成渣渣吧，靠你了。
I’ll check back in on you when I hear that behemoth’s gone. Promise I’ll make it worth your while, too.
等我聽到任務完成的消息後，我會來找你的，必不會讓你白白打工。
Capisce? Good. Bye.
沒問題了吧？那就拜拜。
…She hung up.
…她掛斷了。
Before you can put your phone away, it starts ringing again.
你還沒來得及收起手機，鈴聲又響了起來。
It seems like an important call.
看起來是個很重要的電話。
\PN, I need your help. It’s urgent.
\PN，我需要你的幫助，緊急！
You know the <imp>catacombs</imp> under Prizca?
你知道宏禮市的<imp>地下墓穴</imp>嗎？
There’s an entrance in the <imp>sewers</imp>. I need you here, now.
你可以通過<imp>下水道</imp>的入口進來，我在這裡等你，快點！
I’ll explain when you get here – this isn’t the most secure way to communicate.
等你到了之後我再解釋...電話通信算不上安全。
It’s bad, though. Real bad. I need a trainer of your caliber.
情況非常糟糕，非常非常糟糕！我需要你這樣的訓練家。
Thanks. I know this is sudden, but I can’t overstate how much I need your help ASAP.
謝謝，我知道很突然，但這邊說成多麼緊急都不過分。
Listen, kid, if I could call in a couple Chasm strike teams, I would.
聽著，孩子，如果我能指望義軍，早叫他們了。
But things change, and now all I have is you. You are NOT going to like the consequences if you don’t help me.
但是世事難料，現在只有你你，如果你不來，這個後果，我相信你也不會喜歡的。
Please.
拜託了。
Bring the best team you’ve got. It’s gonna get ugly.
帶上你最強的精靈，這不是能簡單應付的。
Hey, just checking in. What’s going on? Making progress?
嘿，日常檢查，情況怎樣？你不會一直沒進展吧？
Oh, wow. Really trying your li’l heart out, aren’t you? More than one gym!
好傢伙，你真是拼命了啊！打了不止一個道館！
Ah, don’t get all broken up about it.
哈哈，別在意這種事。
You could be in the big city with six badges under your belt and it wouldn’t matter.
只要到了大城市這邊，就能拿到六個徽章了。
Why, I never.
為什麼？隨便你。
Haven’t you heard blood’s thicker than water?
沒聽說過血濃於水嗎？
Practically a type advantage.
這就是一種屬性優勢。
Well, whatever -- keep your secrets.
不過，隨便你吧，保護好你的小祕密。
As for me, I’m taking a break before facing Noel.
至於我，打算在面對諾埃爾前，稍微休息一段時間。
You don’t know him -- and, let’s be honest, you probably never will -- but he’s kind of a big deal.
哦，你可能不知道他是誰...當然你可能永遠都不會認識他，那可是個大人物。
So while you’re scuttling to and fro like a Falinks without an officer, I’ll be relaxing.
所以，當你什麼時候，像個沒有頭頭的列陣兵一樣，四處瞎轉悠的時候，我就可以放鬆一下咯。
Wish you were here!
真希望你就在這裡啊！
He hung up…
他掛斷了…
Wow, that was… a complete breeze.
哇，真是…輕而易舉啊。
A joke, honestly.
當然，只是隨便說說。
That’s my sixth badge now. You?
這是我的第六個徽章了，你呢？
Wow. I remember that.
哦，我記得那個。
Wait, how did you even schedule a challenge?
等下，你怎麼預約到挑戰的？
I made an appointment before I got on the ship.
我當時在船上的時候就預約了。
You... you're serious about this, aren't you?
你...你沒糊弄我，對吧？
That can’t be right.
這不可能。
You’re better than that.
你肯定比這強。
Not by much, but if you’re lying, then… you’re taking this seriously. Huh.
你不可能菜成這樣，不過，既然你在撒謊，也就是...你對這場競爭很認真嘛。
Hah! That never gets old.
哈，我猜也是這種迴應。
You remind me of… I guess a Zangoose, right? So angry, but so normal.
你又讓我想起了...那個貓鼬斬對吧？火氣大得很，當然不是一般系那個。
But you are really angry, aren’t you?
但你火氣真的很大不是嗎？
Well, you’ve certainly made good time, but this is where things start getting harder.
哈哈，反正你的確趕上好時候了，現在，情況會變得越來越難。
You’ve still got a lot of ground to cover.
你還有很多事情要做。
See you at the championship!
競技大會上見！
I’ll make sure to look in the stands for you.
我一定會幫你留意看臺位置的。
He hung up… again.
他又掛了...
Hey, \PN. Things going well on your front?
喂，\PN。你那邊進展如何？
Good. You’ve got eight badges now, right?
很好，你現在有八個徽章了對吧？
That’s... it’s something. You’ll excuse me if I’m not too preoccupied with the whole gym challenge shebang.
我這邊可不像道館挑戰...已經忙得焦頭爛額了。
That makes one of us.
那，我們就一樣了。
Between the avatars and... recent developments... I’ve been swamped.
加在化身和...近期的事之間，我可是一直忙得不可開交。
Yeah, frickin’ tell me about it. I know exactly what you’re talking about, too.
是啊，我想你也知道是怎麼回事。
Listen: I know the stress is probably getting to you, but we’re in the endgame now.
我知道你可能也很有壓力，但我們已經快到尾聲了。
Be a hero, become Champion, go home to Mavis. Everyone’s happy, right? Smiles all round.
成為英雄，成為冠軍，回到梅維斯身邊，讓大家都開心地笑起來。
So, yeah, just a li’l bit longer.
所以...再成長一點就好了。
Take down those avatars if you can spare the time, come back to Prizca for the Championship, and... we’ll see about Yezera.
如果你能抽出時間，就去多解決幾個化身吧，然後回宏禮市參加競技大會，然後...再去處理葉澤拉的問題。
Thanks, \PN. I know it’s a lot.
謝了\PN，我知道事很多。
Thanks.
謝謝。
Whoever the hell it is helping Yezera, they’ve been making the rounds.
無論是誰在幫葉澤拉，他們一直在四處活動。
Good news is that you seem to be their priority. Haven’t been, y’know, rampaging. Which is good.
好消息是，你是他們的首要目標，這樣你可以順路解決一些問題。
I’ve had zero luck trying to track them down. I’d hire Alessa again if she’d return my calls – but, hey, that’s why I have you, right?
我不知道他們在什麼地方。如果阿萊莎能再接電話的話，我還會再僱她做些什麼...或許這就是我找上你的原因？
Yes and no. You’re gonna have to cut through some of the best trainers in the region, but it ain’t just busywork this time.
是，也不是，你得從本地區的訓練家中拔得頭籌，但這次不只是工作而已。
Not that it ever is – thanks, by the way – but this one should be especially interesting for you.
順便說一句，謝謝...不過這次你會特別感興趣的。
That’s what I like to hear. This ain’t gonna be an easy operation, but I trust in your abilities.
我就喜歡聽你這麼說，這次行動不會輕鬆，但我相信你的能力。
Mostly in committing violence. Lots of violence. Though, actually, maybe try talking this one out?
主要是得用暴力解決...一次接著一次地用暴力解決。當然，如果能說服他們最好不是嗎？
You’re gonna want to hear this one. Trust me.
我覺得你想聽我接下來的話。
I mean, you’ve got a minute before the Championship anyways. This op is... it’s pretty dire, importance- wise.
我的意思是說，反正你離冠軍就差最後一步了，這次行動...重要性非常高。
I’ve got a confirmed sighting on Yezera. She’s back in her hometown – <imp>Whitebloom</imp>.
我確定看到葉澤拉回家了，我是說她老家 – <imp>白花鎮</imp>.。
Yezera’s got a few titans on her and some kind of master plan, so she’s your first priority.
她身邊還帶著幾個巨人，看起來有某種計劃，再加上你是她的首要目標。
\PN... thanks in advance. Try and be understanding with Yezera. She’s... dealt with a lot.
\PN...我會提前向你表示感謝，試著去理解葉澤拉吧，她...承受了太多了。
But do what you have to do.
不過，按你自己的方式行動就好。
Do what you have to do, come back to Prizca for the tournament, and go home a Champion.
然後就做你該做的事情，來宏禮市參加競技大會，再以冠軍的身份回家。
Happy endings all-round, right?
皆大歡喜，對吧？
Right. Bye.
就這樣了，拜。
Hey-o! Been a lil' bit but I managed to pry your number from Zain.
喂！很久不見了啊，不過我從贊恩那裡要到了你的電話。
Sucks that I couldn't face you in the Tournament, but I've got a surprise to make up for it!
很遺憾沒能在競技大會上與你對決，但我這裡有個驚喜可以彌補。
Heard about this place called the <imp>Battle Monument</imp>.
聽說有個叫<imp>對戰紀念碑</imp>的地方。
The whole idea is that you can fight through a gauntlet of AI trainers. Neat, right?
核心玩法是讓你挑戰一連串AI訓練師。挺酷的，對吧？
They're weird about directly inviting people, but you're a champion so you should just waltz right in. It'll be fine.
他們邀請的人都是一些高手，而且你是冠軍，所以可以大搖大擺地進去。
I'll send the GPS coordinates to you so you can sail on over and give it a looksie.
我會把GPS座標發給你，這樣你就能開船去看看了。
Oh yeah, guess I didn't say before, but the Battle Monument is a big tower in the middle of the ocean.
哦，對了，我之前沒說，戰鬥紀念碑是海中央的一座高塔。
If I didn't know better, I'd think it was some evil villainous lair.
如果不是事先了解的話，我會誤以為那裡是什麼邪惡巢穴。
Anyways, I'll be hanging around the Battle Monument for the foreseeable future, so meet me here, ya hear?
總之，我接下來會一直待在<imp>對戰紀念碑</imp>附近，記得來找我，聽到了嗎？
I've got some new team configurations I really wanna try against you.
我組了些新隊伍配置，真想找你試試看。
...
。。。
...Ok yeah someone here just asked to battle me, and I'm not gonna turn that down, so I gotta end the call now.
...呃...有人來跟我對戰了，我不可能拒絕這個機會，所以我要掛斷了。
Hope you're doing well, be safe, make good choices, have fun, et cetera. Bye bye!
希望你們一切順利，注意安全，然後做出正確的選擇，並玩得開心。再見咯！
…They hung up.
…掛斷了。
They must really want to talk with you.
他們一定想和你談談。
A couple seconds later, you receive a text message with the coordinates to the Battle Monument.
幾秒鐘後，你收到了短信，上面有戰鬥紀念碑的座標。
Hello to you, young one.
你好啊，年輕人。
It is I, Dr. Hekata.
我是經方博士。
Do not worry about how I learned of your cellphone number. I simply divined it.
我怎麼知道你手機號碼的？別擔心，只是猜到了而已。
I have a topic to discuss of some importance.
我只是有件事要跟你說。
I beseech you—<imp>visit my abode in Grouz</imp>. There we shall discuss.
就當是我的懇求了...<imp>來我在古治鎮的住所</imp>面談吧。
Apologies for the interruption to your adventure, young master.
抱歉打斷你的冒險之旅，少主。
However, given that you've sent a number of Pokemon to Storage, I thought it best that I inform you of my project.
由於您寄送了很多的精靈，我覺得還是要跟您說一下我的計劃。
To make it short: Your family owns an unused Estate here in Makya.
讓我們長話短說 - 您名下有一處在馬凱亞的莊園。
Since you're taking on the Makyan Gym Challenge, I took the initiative to renovate the grounds for our use.
由於之前一直處於棄置狀態，所以我在聽說您要來這邊進行道館挑戰之後，便自作主張將其修繕了一番。
I've set up a system that sends the Pokemon you store in your PC to this <imp>PokÉstate</imp>.
這是我所寫的一個程序系統，您可以將存儲在電腦中的精靈送到這座<imp>莊園</imp>裡休憩。
I'll take care of them there while you are busy with your journey.
當您忙於旅途時，我會在那裡好好照看它們。
I love Pokemon variety, so I've prepared lots of <imp>EXP Candy</imp> to give you as your collection grows.
隨著莊園裡的精靈種類越來越多，我也可以給您提供一些<imp>經驗糖果</imp>，幫助您完成這次的旅程。
Once you've earned some, I'll send them to you through the PC.
我會將它們寄存在電腦中，您可以隨時取用。
I'll continue to wait for you on the boat. If you want to visit the PokÉstate, send me a ping at any PC.
我會繼續在船上等您，如果您想要前往莊園，只需要用電腦發消息給我就好。
I'll take you there immediately.
我會立即帶您前往那裡。
That is all. I will distract you no further, young master.
大概就這樣了，最後再次致歉，抱歉打斷了您的旅程，少主，祝您接下來一切都順利。
\i[TAROTAMULET]The Tarot Amulet spasms like something dying.
\i[塔羅護符]這個塔羅護符就像一個病入膏肓的人一樣在痙攣著...
You feel your pupils dilate and somewhere bleak and broken almost comes into view at the corners of your vision.
你的瞳孔逐漸放大，視野中出現了一個荒涼破敗的地方。
A woman’s voice whispers from that place – almost familiar, but not quite.
一個女人正在那裡喃喃自語...那聲音即熟悉，又感到陌生。
You shouldn’t have reversed that amulet, dearest.
你不該把護身符反過來的，親愛的。
The woman who gave it to you was trying to protect you.
把它給你的女人是想保護你。
Now, though, charms for safe beginnings turn to invitations of dire endings.
但現在，安全旅程的魅力，變成了可怕結局的邀約。
Maybe there’s something to learn from interlacing your journey with the path of ordeals, though.
不過，將你的旅程與磨難交織在一起，或許還能學到更多的東西。
Enjoy this brief, bitter taste of the end, darling, and I’ll try and pull some strings should you prove victorious.
享受這短暫而苦澀的結局吧，如果你贏了，親愛的，我會想辦法幫助你的。
\i[TAROTAMULET]Once again the amulet twitches.
\i[塔羅護符]護符再次抽搐起來。
Once again, you can almost make something out, just past your peripheral vision.
你又一次在視野之外，彷彿看到了什麼東西。
Once again, she speaks.
是她，她又說話了。
Oh? You’re back, dearest. Lovely.
親愛的，你回來了，真可愛。
These people are tied inextricably to this region’s secrets; its conspiracies.
這些人與這個地區的祕密和陰謀密不可分。
Let me implant a bit of my demesne into theirs, and I might be able to tease them open like a faulty lock.
讓我把自己的領地植入其中，或許能像打開一把壞鎖一樣，將一切變得透亮。
You want to know more, don’t you? Want them to trust you?
你也想知道更多對吧？你希望他們能信任你？
Then prepare to enjoy another trial.
那就準備享受另一場審判吧。
\i[TAROTAMULET]It’s the amulet again.
\i[塔羅護符]又是護身符。
It isn’t the thing itself that’s in pain. No, something else is – something larger.
痛苦的不是事物本身，是別的...更大的東西。
Something is wrong in this region.
這個地區出問題了。
Another challenge, another opportunity.
又一個挑戰，又一個機遇。
I never put much stock into mysticism until my hand was forced. I’m so glad to see my investment paying dividends.
在我被逼無奈之前，從來不相信所為的神祕主義，但現在很高興看到，自己的投資得到了回報。
These people don’t even know I’m threading their fate through yours!
這些人甚至都不知道，我把他們的命運，與你的命運緊緊連在一起了！
I paint an impressed expression on their malleable faces – so long as you can walk the walk.
我在他們那可塑性很強的臉上，畫上了印象深刻的表情...當然，只有你能做到。
Go on, dearest. You know the rules by now.
去吧，親愛的，你現在已經知道規矩了。
\i[TAROTAMULET]The reversed amulet spasms and the other place impends on you.
\i[塔羅護符]護符再次痙攣，又有一個地方逼近你了。
That voice… it’s painfully familiar.
那聲音...熟悉地令人心痛。
Oh, you already know who I am, child.
哦，你已經知道我是誰了，孩子。
I’m the one that’s waiting for you at the end of the line. The end of your line… and of every line.
我就是那個在終點等你的人...即是你的終點，也是整條線路的終點。
Makya is a place rich in history.
馬凱亞是個歷史悠久的地方。
That’s why you endure these tastes of my demesne, isn’t it? To learn history?
你在學習這裡的歷史嗎？這就是你忍受我的原因對吧？
Well, even history ends. You’ll understand eventually.
好吧，即便歷史就此終結，你也能最終明白。
Go on. Show me what a conqueror you are, darling.
繼續吧，親愛的，讓我看看你是個怎樣的征服者。
\i[TAROTAMULET]At this point, you can almost hear fate whimpering through the amulet.
\i[塔羅護符]此時此刻，你幾乎可以通過護身符，聽到命運的嗚咽。
Her voice shushes it, but does not comfort it.
她在安慰它，卻沒有安慰的語調。
Where did Imogene get this thing? I doubt she realized the significance of the sliver of stone she implanted within this amulet.
伊莫珍是從哪兒弄到它的？我猜她根本沒有理解，在這裡面植入那塊石頭的意義。
It was uplifted from a forbidden place where history is tortuous and frayed.
那時從歷史曲折的禁地中升起的。
Its latent power, the witch’s arcana, and, of course, my… expertise… all aligned to make my little bits of influence possible.
潛藏著力量、奧術，當然還有我自己的專長...所有這些結合起來後，讓我的影響力一點點變成可能。
I hope you feel lucky, darling: you are.
我希望你能意識到自己的幸運，親愛的。
Always.
你永遠都是幸運的。
\i[TAROTAMULET].....
\i[塔羅護符].....
There’s something calming about the hellscape you can almost perceive.
你幾乎可以感知到地獄般的景象。
It’s a calm hell; quiet and somber.
那時一個平靜、沉寂的地獄。
Her voice is much the same.
她的聲音也是如此。
If only I could twist these gym leaders’ roles without having to suffuse their arenas with my demesne and all its… antipathy.
如果我可以改變這些道館館主，讓他們的道館不至於充滿我的領地...那該有多好。
History ends quietly, but not kindly.
歷史的結局是平靜的，但並不美好。
Here, our day-to-day lives are much like what you endure in these battles.
在這裡，我們的日常生活，就像你們在戰鬥中經歷的一樣。
Oh, don’t pity me. My only point is that I would gladly spare you the intensity of fate’s dying gasps if I could, trust me.
哦，不用可憐我，我唯一想說的就是，如果可以，我很樂意讓你，免受命運臨終前的劇烈喘息。
Trust me, darling.
相信我，親愛的。
\i[TAROTAMULET]As the amulet twists and writhes, you can feel the tension of invisible threads being pulled taut.
\i[塔羅護符]隨著護身符的扭曲和蠕動，你感受到無形的絲線被繃到了最緊。
They are wrapped around the amulet, and around you.
它們纏繞著護身符，也同樣纏繞著你。
Somewhere behind you they frayed into thousands of strands, and ahead of you they extend to somewhere distant.
在你身後的某處，它們成千上萬，細如髮絲；在你身前的某處，它們交織綿延，直至天際。
There they all end.
最終在這裡結束。
You understand by now, don’t you? Makya is history.
你現在明白了吧？馬凱亞已經成為了歷史。
You, darling, are a history to me – a singular history.
親愛的，你對我來說也是...是一段獨特的歷史。
And I am a singular history projected forward.
我是一段向前投射的獨特歷史。
You have the benefit of what we’ll call a privileged reference frame, and I thank you dearly for letting me glimpse through your eyes at it.
你擁有我們稱為特權的優勢，感謝你讓我通過你的眼睛看到它。
Not to mention making a few… alterations.
更不用說...改動些許了。
Don’t think too hard on it, dearest.
別想太多，親愛的。
\i[TAROTAMULET]The amulet has gone still.
\i[塔羅護符]護身符不見了。
Something is changing – the threads are being woven back together, or severed, or both.
有些東西正在發生變化...絲線正在重新編織在一起，又或者被重新切斷。
Someone is taking matters into their own hands.
有人正在自作主張。
No, that isn’t me.
不，那不是我。
We both know who it is, though, don’t we?
我們都知道是誰，對吧？
You should probably stop her from doing that, or one of us could end up in the other’s place.
你也許應該阻止她這樣做，否則我們中的一個，可能會在對方的位置上就此終結。
You were not made for the terminus, and I was not made for a utopia.
你不是為了終結而生，我也不是為了美好而生。
And no human was made for the paradise she’s planning.
沒有誰是為了她的天堂而生。
…\PN, you know who I am, don’t you?
…\PN，你知道我是誰對吧？
We won’t be speaking for a little while, but know that I’m watching over you, child.
接下來我們有段時間沒法再交流了，但我會看著你，孩子。
My child.
我的孩子。
…Agonizingly familiar.
…令人痛苦的熟悉感。
But, still, she is a stranger to you, this woman who almost has your mother’s voice.
但，她對你仍是個陌生人，即便她有著與你母親幾乎一致的聲音。
No.
不想。
Why are you down here?
你為什麼在這裡？
Who are you?
你是誰？
Whose Pokémon are those?
這是誰的精靈？
How do you know?
你怎麼知道的？
I doubt it.
我很懷疑。

Hey champ, how's it hanging?
嘿冠軍，最近怎麼樣?
Recently got a few uhh... assets, that I'm looking to sell. Fell off of a Trainer's backpack.
最近搞到了點...好貨，都是從訓練家的揹包掉出來的，我想把它們出手掉。
I'm a nice guy, so I'll give you a nice price.
我這個人很好說話的，所以我會給你個合適的價錢。
You got $5000 on you? I've got a Numel with your name on it if so.
$5000有嗎？要是有的話，這隻呆火駝身上就寫你名字了。
You sure? You ain't gonna find a deal like this again.
確定？過了這個村可就沒這個店了。
Heh, pleasure doing business with ya.
呵呵，很高興和你做生意。
\PN hands over $5000 in exchange.
\PN 交給對方 $5000。
Well, gotta hit the road. Cash is only useful if you spend it, ya know.
好了，我得走了。畢竟，錢只有花掉時才有用。
You missing the cash? Hmm.
唔，你說你手頭緊？
You've... got your own set of problems, huh?
你…你也有自己的難處吧?
Formation 4C, Gurdurr!
鐵骨土人，4C陣型！
Get ready to block 'em!
準備好擋住它們！
Our defensive line collapsed...
我們的防線崩潰了...
We need to hit the gym. I hope Eko is taking challengers!
我們需要去道館，希望艾克會接受我們的挑戰！
Oh… you destroyed it.
啊…你把它幹掉了。
I was watching that avatar, and you just… dismissed it.
我正在觀察那個化身，可是你給它...唉...
Well, it couldn’t last forever.
也是，它也不可能一直存在下去。
Nice to meet you. My name’s <imp>Skyler</imp>.
自我介紹一下，我是<imp>斯凱勒</imp>。
You were superb, by the way. Fought like the sun against the morning mist.
你剛剛的表現就如刺穿晨霧的陽光一般耀眼。
And, I suppose I can’t complain. I can leave now, at the very least.
我也沒什麼可抱怨的。至少現在可以離開這裡了。
Skyler.
斯凱勒。
I don’t know what else you want me to say. I’m a traveler on a pilgrimage of sorts, which I can now continue.
我不知道你還想讓我說什麼，我只是一個正踏在朝聖之路上，並將繼續走下去的旅者而已。
All thanks to you, of course.
當然，多虧了你我才能繼續前進。
I’d opted to take a short nap before continuing my pilgrimage.
在朝聖的旅途中，我也需要在路邊小睡一會兒。
Hah. Bit of a mistake. The avatar showed up while I was sleeping, not that I minded.
哈哈，所以那個化身，是在我睡覺時出現的，不過我倒是不怎麼介意。
Makya’s a beautiful region, full of beautiful people. But I’m going to admit that I’m here for the avatars.
馬凱亞是個美麗的地區，有著各種各樣美麗的人們，不過我來這裡就是為了這些化身。
Everyone’s concerned with how dangerous they are, but I think they’re missing the point.
所有人都只考慮自己的安危，我認為他們忽略了最重要的事。
We’ve gotten jaded. Pokémon used to be magical. We used to worship them. I think we’ve forgotten that.
我們變得麻木了，傲慢了。精靈是多麼奇妙的存在，那時我們對它們尊之敬之。但現在的人們卻遺忘了這一點。
So are you! Look how you fought!
你也跟他們一樣！看看你戰鬥的樣子就能明白了！
But I’m interested in you nonetheless. Call it a dangerous obsession or a leap of faith – your pick.
但無論現在你怎麼想，我都對你很感興趣。至於是危險的執念還是信仰昇華，那要看你自己的想法如何變化了。
But were they always? You’ve heard legends of Pokémon raising mountains and oceans.
但它們一直都是現在這樣嗎？你應該也聽說過那些傳說吧？
We were created by Pokémon, and they’ll be the end of us someday.
我們人類是精靈創造的，也總有一天，它們會毀滅我們。
At least, that’s what they say of Arceus and Yveltal, not to mention all the rest.
這是人們對阿爾宙斯和伊裴爾塔爾的描述和看法，更何況傳說中可不只有這兩位。
I’m glad to hear you agree.
很高興我們擁有共識。
Maybe it’s a foolish endeavor, seeking these things out. I’m sure they’d maul me given half a chance.
也許去尋找這些化身是種愚蠢的嘗試，我敢肯定只要有機會，它們就會將我們撕成碎片。
But maybe reverence, not fear, is what they’re looking for.
但我在想有沒有可能，它們要的，是敬畏，而並非恐懼。
In any case, I’m glad I met you. Technically, I suppose you saved me.
總之，很高興認識你，嚴格意義上，也是你救了我。
I’ll be back on my little journey now, but, uh, I’ll see you again.
我要繼續旅程了，不過，我們會再見的。
A trainer like you must be seeking badges, right? So let’s meet in the <imp>town ruined by avatars</imp>.
像你這樣的訓練家一定是在收集徽章吧？那麼，<imp>被化身摧毀的小鎮見</imp>。
I hear there’s a gym leader there. So long, my knight in shining armor.
聽說那裡就有一位道館館主，就此別過，耀眼的騎士。
My grandpapa gave me this Tranquill. He's in the ground now. Wanna fight?
這隻咕咕鴿是爺爺給我的禮物，現在他不在，我們打一架吧！
Welp, I've gotta go! Grandpapa's gonna give me a tour of the mines today!
好吧，我也得走了！爺爺說今天要帶我參觀礦山!
Tranquill! No! Use your Tranquill powers! ...oh.
不！咕咕鴿！快使用你的鴿之力！
Swirlix goes bye-bye...
咕咕鴿...
You with the rangers? Ah, doesn't matter. No one's nabbing our haul!
你是義軍那邊的？哈，無所謂了，反正沒人能搶走我們的戰利品！
I swear, if our fourth was here, we'd kick your teeth in! Where'd that chick run off to, anyways? She needs some teeth-kicking too...
要是我們第四個隊友在這裡，肯定能把你打得滿地找牙！那小妞到底跑哪去了？也太無組織無紀律了…
I've taken worse! If you think I'm done protecting the boss, you don't know me!
我什麼局面沒見過啊？你別以為我就這麼放棄了，小瞧人也是有限度的！
Excuse me! We were about to settle this in battle.
不好意思，我們兩個本打算通過戰鬥來解決問題的。
But, fine, I guess we can find common ground in disposing of you.
但是現在，我覺得可以在先除掉你這件事上達成共識。
...Hmph. Very well. I suppose brute force is your people's specialty. Follow my lead.
哼...很好。看來你的強項就是蠻力？那就試試看吧。
Bah! I have nothing left, and now she is free to waltz on in to the College. Is that what you wanted?
嘿！你把我的精靈都打敗了，這樣我就沒法阻止她進入學校了，這就是你的目的？
No, you know what? I'm leaving.
誰稀罕？我要走了！
The only way I'm coming back is if it's with my dad and a few of his friends.
我會帶著我爸爸和幾個朋友，一塊來討個公道的！
I knew who you were the second I saw your last name on the role sheet.
哼，一聽到你的姓，我就知道你是誰了。
The last time I heard it, it had "Lieutenant" in front of it.
上次聽到這個姓的時候，後面還帶著“中尉”兩個字。
If only you'd inherited some of his prowess in battle, you might've made it past me. Go then, and don't come back.
哪怕只繼承他一小部分實力，你也早就大白我了。所以滾吧，別丟人現眼了！
Urgh... oh, shove off, why don't you?
啊啊啊啊...你這人怎麼這麼礙事？
You too, you old hag.
還有你，礙事的老太婆！
I think you'll find me back here so long as you keep trying to gain entrance, you entitled brat.
不管你以後來多少次，我都會在這裡擋住你的去路，自以為是的小鬼！
Makya's one of the few regions where creative archaeology is still legal. You're kinda lookin' like competition.
馬凱亞是目前為數不多，仍允許進行考古創新研究的地區。你...莫不是競爭對手？
Maybe that's my cue to try a different tactic. I gotta be more subtle than challenging random strangers...
這或許是讓我嘗試不同策略的預警，看來以後得更加謹慎地行事了...
Well ain't that a cryin' shame. Guess Makya's a bit rougher than I thought...
真是令人悲憤的恥辱感啊。看來馬凱亞比我想象中更棘手...
Those Evolution Stones are all ours! You can't have any!
那些進化石都是我們的！你一個也別想帶走！
Aagh! Fine! I'll leave! I've got my evolutions, anyways.
啊啊！行吧！我走我走！反正我已經拿到想要的進化石了。
...I'll be back. I'll be back, and if I ever see you again, things're gonna be different. I swear I'll...
...我一定會回來的。下次再見到你，一切都會不同。我發誓...我一定會...
The berry plant is growing.
樹果還在生長中。
Yo...so I heard there was like, some items to steal on this route?
聽說這是一條適合偷物品的路？
I got nothin' to say. You good at battling.
我無話可說，你很擅長對戰。
Bruh. Ok then, I guess.
我覺得，差不多吧。
I refuse to let someone like her into the Academy.
我不會允許她這樣的人入學的。
We have enough of her sort at the Academy as it stands...
學校裡她這樣的學生已經太多了...
Listen, kid, I'm gonna give you one last warning: you can either hit the road, or bite the dust. No? Fine. We'll do it the hard way.
聽著，小鬼，最後一次警告：要麼滾蛋要麼死！什麼？好吧。那我們就用硬的。
Hah, well, you win some, you lose some. I'm not so broken up about it.
哈，好吧，有贏有輸，也不是不能接受。
Helena can't afford proper guards for LuxTech's shipments, so there'll always be business for me. See you around, hero.
海蓮娜請不起稱職的警衛來看管光華的貨物，所以我一直都有生意可做。回頭見了，小英雄。
C'mon, kid. We're not giving up on this little nook unless we have to... and I'm not scared of your little posse.
來吧，小鬼。除非萬不得已，否則我們不會放棄這個地方…而且我也不怕你們這群人。
No thanks.
不要。
I'll take it.
我要了。
Hello.
啊，你好。
Who are you?
你是什麼人？
Why are you here?
你為什麼在這裡？
They ARE dangerous.
精靈很危險。

I imported all these Geodudes from Alola to study their geomagnetic properties, but the moment I let them out this avatar appeared!
我為了研究地磁性質課題，從阿羅拉進口了這些小拳石，但是我剛把它們放出來，那個化身就出現了！
I don't know what to do, it's made the Geodudes go into a frenzy!
我不知道該怎麼辦，它讓小拳石們都瘋了！
If you could defeat it for me, I'll be waiting over here.
你能幫我打敗它嗎？我實在解決不了這種問題。
If you could defeat the avatar over there for me, I'll be waiting here.
你能幫我擊敗那裡的化身嗎？我實在解決不了這種問題。
Goodness me, thank you. Here, take this Geodude.
天哪，謝謝你。來，這隻小拳石給你了。
You not only deserve a reward, but my hypothesis is that the avatar appeared when I had so many together in one place....
這是你應得的，另外我懷疑是不是有太多小拳石聚集在一起，才導致了化身的出現...
My hypothesis is that the avatar appeared when I had too many Alolan Geodudes together in one place....
我懷疑是不是有太多小拳石聚集在一起，才導致了化身的出現...

I was supposed to have a meeting with Kurt today about gracefully decommissioning some of the cluster, but he never showed up.
我今天本來要跟庫特開個會，討論如何從容地退役回家，但他一直都沒來。
Doesn’t he know that maintaining legacy systems adds unnecessary fragility?
難道他理解不了維護過去只會讓一切變得更脆弱嗎？
I really wish the vendor here would sell coffee.
真希望這裡的商店能賣咖啡。
There's a high demand for it, and no one wants to walk through an entire cave just to visit the cafe in Novo Town.
這裡的大家對咖啡的需求量很大，總不能天天為了買咖啡，還要穿過山洞去望新鎮吧？
You and Helena had something secretive to discuss, is that it?
聽說你和海蓮娜有祕密要談?
I'd love to ask, but, well, I need this job more than I need to satisfy my curiosity.
我很想問，但是，比起滿足我的好奇心，能留住這份工作更重要。
Either way, that was a great battle!
不管怎樣，那都是一場精彩的戰鬥！
A Shiny Corviknight!
是閃光鋼鎧鴉！
It's too busy watching the campus to notice you.
它忙著巡視校園，根本沒注意到你。
It’s hard to get promoted when the top level talent here are former Team Chasm lieutenants.
這裡的高級人才都是前裂隙隊的幹部，一般人很難得到晉升。
They're such good battlers. It makes one jealous.
他們太過優秀，讓人嫉妒。
We're trying to debug some major issues with the older supply chain databases.
我們正在針對舊供應鏈數據庫出現的嚴重問題進行調試。
Kurt and Pearce were talking about just wiping the thing.
庫特和皮爾斯正在討論要不要直接將數據庫清空重建。
Just because they used to be Helena's lieutenants doesn't mean she won't have their hide if she catches them cutting corners!
就算他們以前是海倫娜的副官，如果被發現失職行為，也一定會受到嚴厲處罰的。
Closed while Helena participates in the Makya Championship Tournament.
馬凱亞競技大會期間暫停營業。
You might be wondering how I nabbed myself a timeslot to fight Helena.
你或許想知道，我是怎麼預訂到挑戰海倫娜的時間的。
But I'll never tell, teehee!
但我不會告訴你的，嘿嘿！
My team, however, is an open book. Immunities to Water, Electric, and to stat lowering.
不過我會公開我用來挑戰的隊伍，一支抵抗水、電，來降低所承受傷害的隊伍。
Stick around to fight me, and I'll show it to you.
來跟我打一場，我就會讓你見識一下。
Third gym's the charm, or something like that. Fight me?
第三次道館挑戰之前，先跟我來一場？
Understood.
明白了。
I'll be here until you wish to battle.
我會在這裡等你準備好。
I'm gonna show you the difference between strategy and tactics!
讓我告訴你戰略與戰術的區別吧！
Just like that, my team's put to the sidelines.
我的隊伍就這樣被打敗了。
A knack for tactics, that's what you got. Helena'll be impressed, I know it.
這就是你的戰鬥訣竅？海倫娜一定會對你刮目相看的。
Healing centers uhh... to the west. So go off and do that now.
治療中心呃...在西邊，現在就去吧。
Healing center's uhh... to the west. So go off and do that now.
治療中心呃…在西邊。現在趕緊去治療吧。
She just switches around a lot? That's the "tactics" everyone around here's been hyping up?
她只是在頻繁的換精靈？這就是他們鼓吹的“戰術”？
I'm a bit dissapointed. Well, let's avoid getting too cocky. I should actually make my attempt before judging.
我有點失望...不過，也不能太自大了，我應該先試試，再做判斷才對。
Bye bye!
回見！

I can already feel the energy coursing through my body.
我能感覺到能量在我體內湧動。
I won't be needing to tide myself over with these anymore.
這樣我就不再需要這些東西了。
Well I don't see any on you. We don't pay you to waste our time with jokes!
到你身上沒有我想要的東西，我們僱你來可不是摸魚的！
This coffee ain't that great, kid.
這咖啡不太好喝，孩子。
In fact, it's awful. You're fired.
說實話，是很難喝，你被開除了。
Pack up your things and leave, wherever you work at.

You ever have someone bother you out of nowhere?
你有沒有被莫名其妙地打擾過?
Just have your Pokemon give 'em one of these, and they'll leave you alone quick.
只要讓你的精靈學會這個，他們就會主動遠離你了。
Yeah, that'll do.
沒錯，這樣就行了。
Either you give 'em one of those, or you bribe 'em with some stuff you don't need.
要麼給他們來一記這樣的技能，要麼用你不需要的東西賄賂他們。
I'm figuring out vacation spots here in Makya.
我正在選擇馬凱亞的度假地。

This park sucks.
這個公園簡直糟糕透頂。
I can't believe they even called it one.
就這，能被稱作公園？
The door is securely locked.
門被鎖著...
A sign reads "Schedule your gym appointments in the large building to the west."
一塊牌子上寫著：“請到旁邊大廈預約挑戰時間。”
Don't you think this wall is ugly?
你也覺得這牆很醜對吧？
Gigantic, and perfectly straight.
鋼鐵般冰冷的高大筆直。
Kind of ruins the natural beauty of this area.
完全破壞了這裡的自然風光。
LuxTech's Makya campus is more than just a workplace.
光華市對於馬凱亞來說，不單單提供了工作崗位。
We're also the undisputed capital of scientific research across the whole region!
還是當之無愧的科技之都！

Helena juggles leadership in this company with contract work for the Makyan government, and even then still finds time to train Pokemon for her gym.
海倫娜不僅要擔任公司的決策層，還得為馬凱亞政府提供各種協助，即便如此，她也能抽出自己的時間，為道館訓練手下的精靈。
If you plan on facing her, you best be wary of her hit and run tactics.
如果你打算挑戰她，一定要提防她的“打了就跑”戰術。
Most of her Pokemon use switch-out moves: Flip Turn, Volt Switch, or U-Turn.
她大部分精靈都會類似於快速折返，伏特替換之類的技能。
If you want a leg up, hazards like Stealth Rocks and Spikes can help a lot.
如果你想搶佔先機，可以用隱形巖之類的對付她。
Or you could trap her 'mons, so they just...can't switch out!
當然也可以困住她的精靈，讓其無法自由地進出戰場！
Oh, I see you have a MasterDex.
哦，你有大師圖鑑！
I have one of those myself. I got it from when I worked under Miss – er, Professor Tamarind.
我自己也有一個。這是我之前在塔瑪琳小姐...呃，塔瑪琳博士手下工作時得到的。
I used to help her keep the grunts from getting too rowdy.
我過去經常幫她管理手下的新兵。
As nice as my job is now, it's certainly less exciting.
雖說現在的工作也很不錯，但缺少了以前那種令人興奮的感覺。
LuxTech makes great products, and cheaply.
光華市生產的商品物美價廉。
Setting up an office in Makya hasn't helped their PR situation, though.
但是他們在公關上有大問題。
In theory, they're thoroughly vetting all hires for past Chasm ties, and Helena's just an advisor... but we all know she's running the show.
上面一直監視著有裂隙隊背景的人，雖說以前海倫娜名義上只是顧問...但大家都知道，她其實是管理層。
Not a good look for the company that recently switched mottos to "Innovation, Inspiration, Integrity."
就算公司的口號已經改成了“創新，靈感與誠信”，也不會對此有什麼幫助。
Yikes.
唉...

Even worse, I had to go down into the Cold Storage basement level to do the deed.
更糟糕的是，我的崗位還被調到冷庫去了！
My father insisted I take his Slowpoke with me from Galar when I got a job here in Makya.
我爸爸他堅持要帶著他的伽勒爾呆呆獸和我來馬凱亞工作。
I don't think it's going to become a financial sage here like he seemed to hope.
我不認為他能像自己預期的那樣，成為所謂的“金融聖手”。
I really want a Rufflet, but I don't want to make the trip over to Grouz.
我很想要一隻毛頭小鷹，但是我又不想去古治鎮。
If you could find one for me, I'd gladly trade over this slobbering, disgusting creature.
如果你能幫我找到一隻，我很樂意用這個流著噁心口水的傢伙跟你交換（在箱子裡選擇精靈）。
Unfortunate.
不幸啊。
Splendid!
太棒了！
Appreciated!
非常感謝！
I'm enjoying my little Rufflet immensely!
我的毛頭小鷹超——級可愛！
Get your lunches, imported premium from sunny Alola!
進口自陽光明媚的阿羅拉的優質午餐盒飯！
All of my test materials got stolen mid-shipment. Again.
我的考試參考書又一次在路上被偷光了！
Apparently not everyone got the memo that Makya shouldn't work that way anymore.
顯然即便到了今天，馬凱亞的治安依然問題不小。
I really hope that Helena can convince the Makyan Rangers to start patrolling our routes.
我真希望海倫娜能要求義軍，在我常走的幾條路上巡邏。

The Growlithe is cowering from everything.
卡蒂狗好像很害怕。
You notice a tag on its collar. Though it's moving around, you can just make out what's written on it.
你注意到它的領子上有個標籤，雖然它一直動來動去，但你還是能看清上面的字。
Its owner apparently lives in Novo Apartments, in Novo Town.
它的主人住在望新鎮的望新公寓。
Oh! It's the lost Growlithe you were told about.
哦，是之前聽說過的，那個走丟的卡蒂狗。
Remembering the instructions you were given, you pull a Milk Bone Treat from your bag.
你還記得那個人給你的提示，從包裡拿出了一個牛奶骨頭點心。
You hand the treat to the Growlithe. After a quick sniff, it eats the treat.
你把食物遞給卡蒂狗，它聞了一下後就將其吃掉了。
You use this opportunity to put Growlithe back into its ball.
你利用這個機會將其收回球裡。
You should return the Growlithe to its owner.

You want to know how my makeup stays fresh with all this ash?
你想知道在這種環境怎麼保持妝容的嗎？
The truth is that I am... a beast of the forest, come to take your soul!
其實我是...沼澤妖怪，來取走你的靈魂!
But, seriously, you don't want to know how this stuff stays on.
但是說真的，你肯定不想知道這東西是怎麼貼在臉上的。
And with that mystery left alluringly open, I will take my leave.
你就自己考慮下這個答案吧，告辭咯！
Hahaha! You should've seen your face! It was so... you.
哈哈哈！你真該看看你自己的臉！它是那麼的...像你。

Fighting alongside a Voltorb is a dangerous game, but I dribble nonetheless. It is my fate.
與霹靂電球並肩作戰是一場危險的遊戲，但我不會改變自己的想法，這，即是我的命運。
One day my children will ask me if I, too, had teachers, and I will say everyone who reminds me I don't explode regularly is my teacher.
總有一天，我的孩子也會問我，“我的啟蒙老師是誰，”我會告訴他，每個提醒我不要總髮脾氣的人都是我的老師。
This was not a failure, for I am unexploded, and every unexploded day is a blessing.
這不是失敗，因為我還沒爆炸，每個沒有爆炸的日子都是上天給我的恩賜。
My last batch of mushrooms went rancid.
我之前採的蘑菇都餿了。
Which stinks!
完了個蛋！
Well, to tell you the truth, I couldn't smell the difference.
說實話，我倒是聞不出什麼不對來。
So I need to get meself acquainted with the smell of healthy mushrooms.
看來我得熟悉一下，新鮮的蘑菇是什麼味道。
Could you do me a favor and bring me a mushroom Pokemon so I can get me a whiff?
那你能幫我個忙，幫我帶一隻蘑菇精靈來聞聞嗎？
I don't have much in the way of rewards.
我...沒什麼可以給你的。
Suppose I could give ya what I confiscated from my nephew.
要不就把沒收我侄子的那個東西給你吧。
He crafted something mighty gross outta my failed harvest.

Appreciate it. Now, lemme get this over with.

這位農場主正在猛吸你的精靈。
Hah...I can see it now. The cash rollin' in from a full healthy harvest.
哈...我看到了！豐收的喜悅正在翻湧！
Anyways, my side of the bargain...
總之，我之前說的...
Suppose I'll get outta yer hair now.
現在我該走了。
The true self can only be found by exploring the world, and beating the crap out of random people you find on the way!
只有通過探索世界，痛毆路上的訓練家，才能實現真正的自我！
After that thrashing I'm gonna have to self-actualize extra-violently to make up! See ya in Kalos!
在捱了那頓揍之後，我要更加暴力地去彌補自我的實現！我們在卡洛斯再見！
Ah, a fellow seeker of enlightenment. Best of luck!
啊，一位追求覺悟的同道！祝你好運!
This is a premiere Bug-type training ground! Samorn told me herself!
賽蒙告訴我說，這裡非常適合訓練蟲系精靈！
Maybe I'm the worm...
或許我才是那隻蟲子...
Down but not out! The true power of the Bug-type!
敗而不倒，這才是蟲屬性真正的力量!
Samorn trains Dragon-types as well! How cool is that!
賽蒙竟然同時訓練龍屬性！這真是太酷啦！
Not as cool as bugs though.
但龍怎麼能跟蟲比！
I saw a band of troubadours in that cave beyond the fence.
我看到一些穿著奇怪的演員進到那個被圍著柵欄的洞裡了。
Do you know anything about them?
你知道他們在幹什麼嗎？
I heard boisterous exclamations of wonder.
我聽到了一些奇怪的聲音。
It's ever so compelling, don't you agree?
你也注意到了，對吧？
Maybe they're up to something...something suspicious?
或許他們...有什麼陰謀？
No
沒
Yes
找到了
[Map8]
Hey there. Miss me?
嘿，想我了嗎？
I finally got here – all thanks to you. I have to say, you don’t look a mite worse for wear considering how much wilderness you trekked through.
終於到地方了...再次感謝你之前幫我脫困。不過我很意外，穿過了一大片沼澤，你看起來卻並無疲憊感。
I can’t cope as well as you can – I need a hot bath and soon.
沒想到你竟然這麼強...我不行，我得找地方洗個熱水澡。
This is the place to be if one’s looking for avatars, or so I heard.
我聽說這裡是尋找化身的好去處。
I must have heard right, because I’ve already found more than I can count on both hands.
顯然這並不是謠言，來到這邊之後，我見到的化身已經超過兩手之數了。
Are you in a rush?
你在趕時間？
All business and no pleasure might not make you dull, but it does make you a bore.
如果人沒有時間娛樂，早晚有時間生病。
So come on – we’re young and free. You can take a few minutes off, can’t you?
盡請揮霍年輕帶來的自由吧，在這裡歇歇腳不好嗎？
Skyler, at your service. We met back in the grassland, between a few avatars.
我是斯凱勒，之前在草地那邊見過，當時旁邊還有一個化身。
The sun and moon were smiling on us, you came to my rescue…
當日月都對我露出微笑時，是你來救我於水火之中...
I could exaggerate further but the truth is striking enough.
我可以用更誇張的方式形容我們之間的相遇，不過事實就已經很夢幻了。
But enough about the two of us. Let’s talk about the specters roaming the town.
關於我們的事情，差不多就聊到這裡吧，現在說說這鎮子上的幽靈。
They’re so… arrogant. Have you ever noticed that?
你注意到了嗎？它們簡直...太傲慢了。
They just don’t care about us fleshy creatures – human or Pokémon. All they seem to notice is the land, each other, and a few very specific objects.
它們根本不在乎我們這些還擁有血肉的生物，它們似乎只在意彼此的領土，以及某些極為特殊的東西。
I know this asking a lot, but… can I borrow a Moon Stone from you?
我知道這個要求很過分，但我…能問你借一塊月之石嗎?
The avatars seem to notice the incredible power inside those stones.
化身們似乎注意到了進化石中蘊含的驚人力量。
Unless you’re asking me why a Moon Stone, in which case, well, I decided apropos of nothing.
至於為什麼是月之石...好吧，我隨便選的。
That’s not entirely true – I don’t want to offend them with a clashing element.
倒也不是完全隨意選的...我不想用相沖的能量激怒它們。
Fire, Water, Sun, the like. And Moon just fits the ambience.
像是火、水、太陽那些...月亮剛好符合這個氛圍。
Safe bet, hmm? So if you have one to spare, please let me know. I’ll pay you back with interest later.
這是個很安全的決策，對吧？所以如果你可以借我，那麼將來，我會連本帶利還給你的。
Ah, fair. I am bringing business into pleasure again, aren’t I? I’m horribly bad at this.
啊，也對。我又把工作和私人生活搞混了，我也對自己這個問題很頭疼。
Well, if you change your mind, you know where to find me.
如果改變主意了，你知道到哪裡能找到我。
I assure you, I’ll pay you back eventually, plus extra.
我向你保證，將來會連本帶利還給你的。
Well that was quick. Honestly, you shouldn’t be so generous! Someone could take advantage of that.
嗯？這麼爽快？老實說，你不該那麼大方，很容易被別人利用的。
I’ve never turned down someone’s hospitality, especially someone like you, but take a minute.
我從不拒絕別人的好意，特別是你，但請先思索一下。
Think about it. I’ll make sure to pay you back, but don’t rush into this.
思索一下是否要借給我這麼貴重的物品。當然我肯定會還給你的，但請不要隨隨便便做出決定。
So, care to part with a Moon Stone?
那麼，你能把一顆月之石借給我嗎？
Just come to see me, then? I appreciate it – and I appreciate seeing you, too.
也就是說，你是來看我的？我真的很高興。
You’ll have to teach me how you stay so composed in places like this. Sometime later, hmm?
晚些時候，能不能教教我怎麼在這種地方保持淡定，好嗎？
You hand over the Moon Stone.
你將月之石交給他。
Thank you very much. I understand these are valuable, even leaving evolution out of the picture.
真的太感謝了，我知道，即便你不需要它，它的價值也不會因此降低。
If one of your Pokémon passed up evolution for this, give them my regards.
如果你的精靈因此放棄了進化的機會，那請代我謝謝它。
I’ll be sure to tell you the results of this offering next we meet.
再次見面時，我肯定會給你帶來好消息的。
And repay you, of course! What do you say to dinner? There’s a place in <imp>Prizca East</imp>.
當然是報答你啦！請你吃頓晚飯咋樣？<imp>東宏禮市</imp>的美食挺不錯的。
Well, you can think on it – I need to track down an avatar, and you need to beat some gym leaders.
不過現在，是時候行動了...我得去追蹤一個化身，而你得打敗一些道館館主。
Until we meet again.
下次再會。
I hate to be a spoilsport, but, uh, that isn’t a Moon Stone.
我實在不想掃你的興，可這不是月之石。
I appreciate the effort, trust me – you’re very generous. I just can’t work with it, though. You keep it.
我很感激你的心意...你真的很大方。只是這個對我來說沒什麼用，你還是自己留著吧。
Avatars seem to care about these stones.
化身似乎對這些石頭很感興趣。
I want to see if I can’t make an offering. Perhaps placate them?
我想試著能不能用這種方式，安撫一下它們的情緒？
And a Moon Stone seems the least likely to offend the ones here in Velenz.
在夜幽市這種地方，月之石應該不會冒犯到它們。
Something like a Fire or Sun Stone would clash, and a Leaf or Dusk Stone is more of what they already have.
而火之石、日之石這些就跟這裡的氣氛相沖了，至於葉之石或暗之石...貌似它們已經有了。
I promise it’s a good cause.
我相信自己的判斷沒錯。
My cousin and I like to hang out here. Take in the cool atmosphere and the night sky.
我和表弟常在這兒發呆，感受清涼夜風和星空。
We still battle people, but like... in a chill way...
我們也會對戰，不過…主打一個佛系…
I'm gonna leave now. Don't like your vibes.
我要走了。你氣場好怪。
Can you feel the energy given off by those evolution stones?
能感受到進化石散發的能量嗎？
It's doing wonders for my stress.
對緩解焦慮有奇效。
Is life worth living if you can't take time to be transfixed by the beauty of nature?
如果連駐足感受自然之美的時間都沒有，活著還有啥意思？
A notice about the Makyan Regional Tournament has been hastily scribbled over.
一張關於馬凱亞競技大會的通知，被潦草地塗抹後扔掉了。
A note added below reads "Not Taking Challengers"
下面增加了一行註釋："不接受挑戰者"
Velenz Gym
夜幽道館
Leader: Rafael
館主：拉斐爾
...
。。。
It seems like the Gym Leader was supposed to write a title here, but the space has been left blank.
按照慣例，館主應該在最後一行寫些什麼，但這裡被空出來了。
Temporary Velenz Ranger Outpost
夜幽市臨時義軍哨所
"Velenz, proud home of-"
"夜幽市，我驕傲的故..."
Claw marks on the sign render the text unreadable.
上面的字跡被爪痕破壞得難以識別。
Don't tell the others, but I'm getting bored of waiting.
別告訴其他人，但我等得有點無聊了。
Well, might as well battle you before <i>they</i> arrive.
算了，在<i>他們</i>來之前，不如和你打一場。
I saw a light come down from the sky and land west of Velenz.
我看到一道光從天而降，落在了維倫茲的西邊。
I was hoping these stones would draw the aliens out, but it's been a week and nothing.
我本來指望這些石頭能引出外星人，但一週過去了，啥也沒有。
Since that failed, you can just take them. Good luck.
既然失敗了，你就拿走吧。祝你好運。
Losing? Now that's an alien feeling.
輸掉？這還真是種陌生的感覺。
That mansion near the menagerie must have something to do with the light I saw.
那座靠近動物園的豪宅一定和我看到的光有關。
My cousin says I'm paranoid, but I definitely saw the place glowing last night.
我表弟說我多疑，但我昨晚確實看到那地方在發光。
I thought this place was supposed to be scary.
我以為這地方會很可怕。
Just seems peaceful to me.
只不過是比別處安靜罷了。
Eek! You're the scary one here!
哎呀！你才是最可怕的!
I'm afraid of bugs, but not ghosts.
我怕蟲子，但不怕鬼。
To be honest, this town hasn't been that scary.
說真的，這裡真沒什麼嚇人的。
I'm having a good time, so I'll hang out here for now.
我在這裡玩得挺開心的，所以我會多呆一陣子。
Got some rare things on sale, stranger!
陌生人，我這裡有東西要賣！
Come back anytime.
隨時再來哦。
East: Repora Forest
東：枯槁森林
South: Barren Crater
南：荒莽火山
No earthlings allowed: that's the rule.
地球人禁止入內：這是規矩。
By the power of the Moon Stone, I will punish you!
以月之石的力量，我將懲罰你！
What? Friendship wasn't enough!?
什麼？友情還不夠嗎！？
You're really gonna invade our special space like this?
你真要這樣闖入我們的專屬空間嗎？
I haven't been a real sailor since they scuttled my ship.
自從他們鑿沉了我的船，我就不算真正的船員了。
I just like the clothes.
我只是喜歡這身衣服。
Hey again. Bet you didn't expect to see me in a place like this, eh?
又見面了。沒想到會在這兒見到我吧？
I'm good at battling, less so at cryptic riddles and haunted towns.
我擅長對戰，但對解謎和鬧鬼小鎮可不在行。
But, let's not let my failures go to waste.
不過，別讓我的失敗白費了。
Put the searching on hold for now, and engage in a little sparring.
先把搜索放一放，來場小對戰吧。
Talk to me again when you see the value in that idea.
等你覺得這主意不錯時，再來找我。
Fighting me's better than fighting any of those Avatars, I'd wager. Prove me right?
我敢說，和我打比和那些化身打有意思多了。證明我說得對吧？
Understood.
明白了。
I'll be here until you wish to battle.
我會一直在這裡，直到你想對戰。
Boo!
嚇一跳吧！
I bow to thee, oh masterful one.
向您鞠躬，哦，大師。
Eh, that was pretty good, I guess.
嗯，還不錯吧。
Some rangers set up a rest spot in the southern part of Velenz.
一些巡護員在維倫茲南部設了個休息點。
Check it out, heal up your party, get back to me.
去看看，治療你的隊伍，然後回來找我。
Some rangers set up a rest spot to the south.
一些巡護員在南邊設了個休息點。
You unlocked Rafael's front door?! That sure saves me the time and frustration.
你打開了拉斐爾家的前門？！這可省了我不少時間和麻煩。
Much appreciated, fellow trainer! Off I go!
非常感謝，訓練家朋友！我走啦！
Rafael may have a layer of earth protecting him from the surface, but it doesn't protect him from my astral projection.
拉斐爾可能覺得在地底可以安然無恙，但這並不能保護他不受我的探測。
I've been watching his battles with some fervor. I wish to grasp the essence of his strategy.
我一直在關注著他的戰鬥，希望自己能掌握他的精髓。
It is, at its core, about dancing.
他的對策核心是舞蹈。
His Oricorio and Alolan Marowak both gain power from dancing done by their allies.
他的花舞鳥跟阿羅拉嘎啦嘎啦，都能從同伴的舞蹈中汲取力量。
If one was feeling particularly devilish, one could aquire a Hattrem.
如果一個人覺得自己特別邪惡，就能得到一個提布莉姆。
That witch has a special ability which can prevent Pokemon from utilizing dance.
而這種精靈有一種特殊能力，可以阻止精靈使用舞蹈。
There's supposed to be a gym leader around here, but he's not keen on taking challengers.
據說這裡有一位道館館主，但他並不喜歡接受挑戰。
He lives <imp>underground</imp> like some hermit.
他就跟個隱士似的住在<imp>地下</imp>某處。
Even locked himself up to make it harder to get in.
為了不被外人打擾，甚至把自己鎖了起來。
Apparently the <imp>lock combination code</imp> is somewhere in the town.
而那把鎖的<imp>密碼</imp>，就在這座廢棄城市的某個地方。
This is all a bit too mental for me right now, so I'm taking a break.
但這周圍的一切讓我有些神經過敏，我得休息一會兒了。
A small handmade sign. It lists an eight-digit code in a big, blocky style.
一個手工製作的小牌子，其中內嵌了一個八位數的密碼鎖。
Why are you here?
你為什麼在這？
Is this going somewhere?
你來這裡幹什麼？
Who are you?
你誰？
Why?
為什麼？
No way.
不給
Sure.
行吧
Not yet.
還不行
Here you go.
給你。
Why do you want it?
為什麼要這個？
Maybe later.
也許晚點吧。
Sure, let's go.
當然，走吧。
[Map9]
STAY AWAY FROM MY PLANTS!
離我的花草遠點!
I give up. My plants are doomed to die.
我放棄了，我註定無法保護它們...
To be honest, they're not even my plants. I just wanted to make a nice bouquet for Lainie.
其實這些花草並不是我種的，我只是想給蘭妮做一個花束。
I just want to protect my plants.
我只是想保護我的植物。
To be honest, they're not even my plants. I don't know who left them here.
其實這些花草並不是我種的，我也不知道是誰留在這裡的。
I was looking around the sinkhole for the Gym Leader, but he wasn't anywhere around there.
一開始來這裡是找館主的，但他貌似不在這附近。
[Map10]
I'm training for my doctorate in Pokemon Biology.
我在攻讀精靈生物學博士學位。
"Do some field work!", they said. "It'll look great on your CV!', they said.
他們都說，“去實地調研吧！這會讓你的簡歷看起來更棒！”
Now here I am, battling the Raikou down there every day to prevent a rampage.
所以我才來到這裡，為了防止雷皇暴走，每天都在與它進行對戰。
Can't say I'm learning nothing though...
基本什麼都沒學到...
Phew... Glad that's over. I've had enough battling to last a lifetime.
唉喲...終於結束了。我已經把這輩子的對戰都打完了。
Time to transfer all my notes to PDF format. Hope the scanners aren't reserved today...
是時候將所有的記錄轉成PDF格式了。希望掃描儀今天沒有被人預約......
Novo College sends us a daily batch of healing items to keep us going.
望新大學每天都會給我們送來一批治療藥物，用來維持我們精靈的健康。
It's useful, but I don't think my team appreciates getting revived four times a day...
這雖然很有用，但我覺得我的隊伍不喜歡一天被複活四次...
Sheesh, felt the shockwaves all the way back here.
天啊，我甚至在這裡也感受到了震顫。
Must have been rough. Glad you showed up.
這一定很艱難，但你成功了。
The only thing that's kept Novo safe from this Avatar is us members of the Battle Club.
唯一保護望新免受化身威脅的就是我們這些對戰俱樂部的成員。
The regular folks sure are lucky so many skilled trainers decided to concentrate there...
這裡的居民太走運了，有那麼多實力高超的訓練家都聚集在那裡...
Wowie, now that was a battle!
哇，這才叫戰鬥!
The club's gonna love to hear about this one.
俱樂部會很高興聽到這個消息。
You should totally come give a talk sometime.
你應該來給我們做個演講，效果肯定很不錯。
[Map11]
Since the Eleig River is in the halfway point of Makya, it's become quite the gathering spot for Trainers.
由於埃利格河位於馬凱亞的中心，因此成為了訓練家們的聚集地。
The trainers on the long stretch of river to the East are relatively casual.
東部河道上的訓練家相對隨和一些。
That is, until you reach the desert research station.
朝那個方向可以直接到沙漠研究站。
The trainers to the west are a bit more serious, especially as one approaches the Cave of Hatching.
而西邊河道的訓練家就嚴肅多了，尤其是啟明之窟附近。
The berry plant is growing.
樹果還在生長中。
Hey, yo. Remember me?
嘿，你還記得我嗎?
Eifion – guy with the Phione? How you doing?
我是艾維恩，帶著霏歐納的那位。你最近怎麼樣?
Awesome. You doing the gym challenge?
太好了，你是在挑戰道館？
Ah, what am I asking – of course you are.
我在說什麼啊...這不是肯定的事嗎...
Nobody hauls around a killer team like that just for fun. Good luck on that.
沒人會為了好玩帶著這麼強力的隊伍。祝你挑戰順利。
Sure, sure. Don’t mean to pry or anything. Happy to see you’re holding up.
啊，我不是想打聽什麼。只是很高興看到你過得不錯。
Yeah, I get that. I’ve been, uh, yeah, through the wringer, y’know?
啊，大概能理解。呃，我也曾經歷過...類似的狀況。
But you just gotta keep your head up.
但你微笑著面對一切，挺過難關就好。
Anyways, how about a quick match?
不管怎樣，來一場速戰速決如何?
Phione here hasn’t been slacking, and I want to show it a proper duel.
霏歐納可不是吃素的，我要好好展現一下它的實力。
You down?
你準備好了嗎？
Oh, yeah, take your time. I think I might need a few minutes to get Phione psyched up anyways.
哦，沒問題，慢慢來。我也得花一些時間讓霏歐納準備準備。
Thanks. Don’t go easy on me, OK?
謝謝，請不要手下留情。
Whoa. We actually did it.
哇，我們真的做到了。
Not without some scrapes here and there – wait, let me heal you.
有些磕碰也是在所難免的...稍等，讓我幫你治療一下。
Figure I might as well pay you back, huh?
我一直覺得，該報答你一下。
Uh, kinda? I’ve trained worse, but, uh, this little fella isn’t exactly a juggernaut.
呃，還好吧？我見過更難對付的精靈，而且...呃...這個小傢伙也不是啥凶猛巨獸。
I wouldn’t be quaking in my boots if I had to face one.
我之前對上的要是這小傢伙，也不會被嚇得瑟瑟發抖了。
OK, I think Phione’s good to go. Ready to fight?
好了，我感覺霏歐納準備好了，可以開始戰鬥了嗎？
Good fight, good fight! Phione, you did great.
打得好，打得好！霏歐納，幹得漂亮。
I mean, \PN, you obviously did way better, but, hey, that’s how it goes.
雖然\PN，你的表現更好，但嘿嘿，事實就是事實。
I used to do a lot better than this. Was pretty good, if I do say so myself, but, eh, it wasn’t really worth it.
要我來說的話，我以前那會兒更強呢，但是....呃，過去就不提了。
You ever run into someone yelling at his Pokémon after he loses and just think, like, who raised this guy?
你有沒有遇到過那種輸掉比賽後對自己的精靈大發雷霆的人？你會不會覺得那些傢伙...很沒教養？
Like, yeah, you get results, but it’s not really sustainable.
或許那樣能讓他們多贏一場，但並不利於長久發展。
They have to feel like living, feeling beings first, and tools of battle second.
培育精靈就要讓它們意識到自身存在的重要，其次才是把它們當作對戰工具。
Or, like, fifth.
呃...感覺還要往後排...
You get what I’m saying, right?
你能明白我什麼意思吧？
Figured as much. Look at me talking at you as if you aren’t obviously a better trainer than me.
我覺得也是，這麼跟你說話，搞得好像我比你優秀一樣。
I’m OK, but I make a lot of sloppy mistakes. Still trying to learn that whole positive reinforcement thing.
我的水平也就...那樣吧，經常犯一些粗心大意的錯誤，最近才開始學習心理強化。
You just gotta make them feel loved, and then they’ll try their best.
只要讓它們感受到愛，它們就會全力以赴。
Pushing them hard wrings potential out of them faster, but it burns them out.
對它們過度施壓雖然能更快地榨取出潛力，但也會讓它們身心交瘁。
Eventually they’ll snap back, or just give up. Or leave you.
最終只會反噬到自己，要麼乾脆擺爛，要麼永遠離開你。
Well, sure, but they’re more than tools. They’re alive, and they have their own wants and needs.
好吧，當然，但它們不僅僅是工具。它們也是生命，它們也有自己的慾望和需求。
And if you kinda lean into that, it works so much better than ordering them around.
如果你能稍微順應這點，那比直接命令它們效果好得多。
Or… maybe not. Obviously you know what you’re doing. I’m not gonna preach to you.
或許…也不一定。顯然你知道自己在幹什麼，我就不對你說教了。
I’ve talked enough. Probably should be listening more, but, uh, I gotta go.
我說得已經夠多了，也許你並不介意，但是...呃，我得走了。
Makya’s a big place, and Phione and I are gonna tour the whole thing.
馬凱亞地區面積不小，我和霏歐納要遊遍這裡的每一處角落。
And the rest of us, of course. So, uh, see you. And thanks again.
當然，還有我的其他精靈，那麼，呃，再見，再次謝謝你啦。
I totally lost my surfboard!
我的衝浪板丟了！
At least I can swim.
好在我會游泳。
Li'l bit of havoc going down around here, just like the good ol' days! I'll show ya why we used to be the top dogs!
最近這裡有一些小騷動，就像我所懷念的以前一樣！我會向你展示我們曾是頂尖訓練家的原因！
Beaten by another freakishly-talented kid? Deja vu, that's what that is...
又被另一個天賦異稟的小鬼打敗了？怎麼總是這樣…
Ah, you ain't nothing. I could beat you any day of the week. Just not... today.
啊，你什麼都不是。我哪天都能贏你。只不過不是…今天。
Prizca Sewers Auxiliary Entrance
宏禮下水道輔助出口
A line which might have read "Authorized Personnel Only" has been crisscrossed with crude graffiti.
下面大概寫著“僅限工作人員”，但被粗暴地劃掉了。

宏禮大橋
North: Prizca West
北：西宏禮市
South: County Park
南：國立公園

西：風霜農場
East: Eleig Stretch

I was thinking of bringing my toddlers to see the bridge. Guess that plan is ruined.
我本來想帶孩子們來大橋這邊玩的，現在看來計劃泡湯了。
Field trip's cancelled!
活動取消！
I'll look on my phone for anything interesting nearby.
我該去網上查查，周圍有什麼其他有趣的地方。
Maybe I schedule a trip to the Gym?
或許...道館一日遊？
Why'd they send a waitress to keep watch when an avatar's on the prowl? This is why!
為什麼在化身四處遊蕩時派一名女服務員來看守？這就是原因！
So, uh, when I said "this is why!" I was supposed to then beat you, and that, uh, didn't happen. So... I'm just gonna go now.
所以，嗯，當我說“這就是原因！”的時候，本該揍你一頓，但是...好吧...我現在得走了。
Well, uh... I guess you're gonna have to cover my shift, 'cause I gotta go hit the Pokécenter.
呃，嗯…你得替我值班了，因為我要去精靈中心。
Now that the bridge is gone, I can swim in peace. Or I could if it wasn't for kids like you!
現在橋沒了，如果不是因為你這樣的小孩，我早就能安心遊泳了！
Wow, you're just as annoying as the cars. I'm out.
哇，你跟那些車一樣討厭，我得走了。
Cool surfing kid, but don't put me in the splash zone next time.
小子，衝浪很酷，但下次別濺我一身水。
No one else comes here, so I guess we're just a little strange.
居然沒有人來這裡，這也太奇怪了。
Great.
很好
Fine.
還行
Could be better.
不太好
Let me prep.
稍等一會兒
Sure, let's go.
好，來吧
Aren't Phione strong?
霏歐納很強嗎？
Of course.
沒錯
I guess?
大概吧
They make good tools.
工具，好用

A locked door. It has a slot for a keycard.
一扇帶有鑰匙卡插槽的門，並且鎖得很牢。
You insert the Team Chasm ID Card.
你插入了裂隙隊身份卡。
The door unlocks with a click.
門咔嗒一聲開了。
Hey, Trainer. You seem like the classy type.
嘿，訓練家，你的氣質很非比尋常嘛。
Let me guess. Born rich? Toxic family relationships? Rampant imposter syndrome coupled with a crippling need to define yourself?
讓我猜猜...出身豪門？家庭關係不合？強烈渴望成功的靈魂？對自我價值實現的強烈需求？
Well, you look like the perfect fit for this Skitty I've managed to get.
你看起來很適合我搞到的這隻向尾喵。
For the absolute steal of $200,000, I'll let you get your hands on one. And guess what -- it's shiny.
只需要$200,000，它就是你的了，而且你猜怎麼著 - 它是閃光的！
Show that to your... mom? Dad? No, definitely mom. Probably a sibling in there as well, huh?
拿給你的…媽媽或爸爸看？不，絕對是媽媽，估計還有一個兄弟姐妹吧？
I'm sure you'll get at least a week's worth of self- worth flaunting that to them. All that quality time for just $200,000.
拿這個跟他們炫耀後，至少能獲得一星期的昂首挺胸權。只要$200,000哦，心動不如行動！
Hah! That's what they all say. You'll be back, sooner or later.
哈！大家都是這麼說的，但早晚會回來。
The Pokemon is all yours, enjoy it while you can.
這精靈是你的了，盡情享受被尊重的感覺吧。
And with that, my early retirement has been secured.
有了這筆錢，我就可以提前退休了。
Tata suck- uhh, client.
再見了，冤大...咳，客人。
With that trifling sum? Surely you can do better than that.
只不過是一筆小錢而已嘛？你得到的可遠超這個價值。
Ah, so you've finally caved? $200,000 for the shiny Skitty. No more, no less.
啊，終於想通了？$200,000買這隻閃光向尾喵。
Are you going into the sauna?
你要去蒸桑拿嗎?
Careful to not go into the underground area. It's where we keep the wild Pokemon that heat up the place.
請不要進入地下區域，那裡關著我們用來發熱的野生精靈。
Unless you want to catch said wild Pokemon I guess...
除非你想抓幾隻…
Well, if you get hurt down there, that's on you.
但是受傷了概不負責！
The sauna is only available to the Rangers and their families.
桑拿房只對義軍和其家人開放。
You'll need a ID Card to get in there.
沒有身份卡不能進。
I'm good.
我不需要
Sure, I'll pay for that.

I got some extra dynamite. Want it for $5000?
我有些多餘的炸藥。5000美元要嗎？
Eh, I can't blame ya. It's dangerous stuff.
呃，我不怪你。這東西確實危險。
Hey, I'll be glad to be done with it.
嘿，能處理掉它我就很高興了。
You hand over $5000 in exchange.
你遞出了5000美元作為交換。
Well, the clock waits for no one. Work calls!
時間不等人啊。工作來了！
You playing at something?
你在打什麼主意嗎？
Walking through Makya really makes me appreciate the drive of some folk.
在逛完馬凱亞之後，我是真的欣賞某些人的決心。
They basically looked at a spot, decided they wanted to build an entire tech campus over it, and they did it.
他們一次次地在荒蕪之地，憑空建立起一座座城鎮，甚至還有這個科技園區。
Wild stuff.
太瘋狂了。
No
沒有
Yes
是的

A home review show is playing on the television.
電視上正在播放家庭節目。
The host is obviously enthused, but the sound is muted, so it's hard to tell what specifically she's excited about.
主持人的表情顯得很興奮，但電視的聲音太小了，你根本聽不清她在說什麼。
A dim light shines from the computer.
電腦指示燈亮著。
Hey y'all! We've got a super special report on the latest in Pokemon!
大家好，我們將在此，為大家報道最新的精靈新聞！
Today we're doing a report on Traits!
今天，是關於“性情”的報道！
What do they mean? What do they do? Which ones are the best?
性情是什麼？有什麼用？哪些性情的精靈相對更好呢？
Well...
嗯...
Traits are little parts of a Pokemon's personality that you might discover after spending some time with them.
每隻精靈除了外在的性格外，還有更為內斂的性情區分，因此剛剛被捕捉的精靈，是不會立即表露它們的性情的，
Pokemon don't always show their hand as soon as you catch them, you need to bond with them to learn more about them!
訓練家們需要與它們建立起更緊密的感情紐帶，才能一點點深入地瞭解它們！
They don't do anything in battle! Any Pokemon can learn to battle just the same!
性情在對戰中並沒有什麼作用，
When it comes to battling, no personality is better than the other!
所有性情的精靈都可以學習各種各樣的戰鬥技巧！
All that matters is finding the right Pokemon for you!
最重要的，是找到與你性情相合的那一隻哦！
That's all for today, ciao!
今天就到這裡，再見！
Well, this will probably be my last entry here.
這可能是我最後一篇日誌了。
Mine's been closed.
礦場已經關閉了。
Permanently, this time. Can't say why.
這一次將是永久關閉，至於原因，我不能說。
Team Chasm has been sending people in and out of the mine every few hours for the last three days.
過去三天裡，裂隙隊每隔幾小時就會派人進入礦區。
It sucks that they're doing this, but they've offered jobs to everyone in the crew.
他們這種做法真的很討厭，可這份工作又是他們給的。
I wouldn't be allowed to turn down that offer, even if I wanted to.
即便我想拒絕他們，也不能這樣做。
Guess I'll have to relocate. Sounds like they'll be putting me somewhere in Southwest Makya.
我估計要搬家了，聽說他們會把我安置在馬凱亞西南方的某個地方。
Gonna miss little Braden. He's a good kid.
我會想念小布雷登的，他是個好孩子。
Oh, hello there.
哦，你好。
No doubt you can hear my child upstairs, shouting and running around dressed up in that stupid Pikachu costume.
你肯定已經聽到了吧，我兒子正穿著傻里傻氣的皮卡丘服，在樓上大喊大叫，跑來跑去。
He never shuts up about becoming a Pokemon master. Those cartoons must have rotted his brain.
他已經被那些動畫片洗腦了，總是嚷著要稱為精靈大師。
He needs a reality check. He should find better career paths, like a doctor or lawyer.
該讓他清醒清醒了，當個醫生或者律師不更好嗎？
You look like a competent trainer.
你看起來很厲害。
If you utterly destroy whatever stupid 'team' he's assembled, I'll give you a reward.
如果你能徹底擊敗他，我會給你一個獎勵。
Have him make a fool of himself, that might set him straight.
讓他出進洋相，才有可能改邪歸正。
I can still hear his incessant screaming. Please, just stop the kid already.
你聽，現在他還在樓下不停地叫，求你了，讓這熊孩子安靜下來吧！
I'm sure crushing him in a battle will be enough to make him stop.
只要你能在戰鬥中徹底擊敗他，他才能明白什麼是現實。
Thank you. Now that his childish dream is done, we can finally get him to sit down and learn something useful.
謝謝你糾正了他那幼稚的想法，這樣他就能安靜地坐下來學習一些有用的東西了。
Here, take this as payment. I'd offer money to anyone else, but Trainers like these sort of things.
給，這個是你的了。本來想給你些錢的，不過訓練家應該更喜歡這個。
One day, that kid will enroll in a college and get a degree that makes some good money.
等那孩子長大，進入大學，拿到一個能賺大錢的學位後，
I'll be proud of him then.
我會為他感到驕傲的。
Traits: Pokemon and You!
性情：精靈與人類

I've always dreamed of being a Pokemon Trainer! Yesterday I went out and caught some. Now my mom HAS to let me be a trainer!
我一直都想成為一名訓練家！昨天我出去抓了一些精靈，現在我媽媽肯定會同意了！
You understand right? If I do well in my first battle, my mom will see what I'm capable of!
你明白我的意思吧？只要我的第一場戰鬥能夠表現出足夠的潛力，媽媽就不會再阻止我！
Battle?
來戰吧！
You just don't get it.
你根本不懂！
LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!
讓我們開 ---- 始吧！
I'm down but not out. You can't ever put me down.
雖然輸了，但我不會氣餒，我永遠都不會放棄！
...

Get lost kid.
小孩別擋道
Sure.
來吧
[Map19]
Be wary of Abilities that grant a Pokemon an immunity they might otherwise not have.
要警惕那些賦予精靈免疫能力的特性。
You might think that a Ground-type attack will knock out your opponant's Eelektross, only to find out that it has Levitate!
不要以為地面系的攻擊可以解決對手的麻麻鰻魚王，因為它們有漂浮特性！
Abilities that grant resistances, such as Realist and Tough, should also be respected.
像現實主義和堅不可摧這種，可以賦予精靈抗性的特性，都應當重視起來。
I live for trash TV.
我超愛看肥皂劇的。
Last week Kimberly slapped Evan because she caught him reading a romance novel that featured a cycling couple.
上週埃文在讀一本自行車情侶的言情小說時被金柏莉發現了，然後就捱了一個響亮的耳光。
They got into a huge fight and ended up breaking all the furniture.
然後他們就大打出手，幾乎幹碎了所有傢俱。
Here's the catch -- they aren't even dating. They knew each other for four days.
但是...他們還沒有約過會，甚至才認識了四天。
She was jealous because she thought Evan was hinting that she needed to work out more.
金柏莉生氣的原因是她覺得埃文在諷刺她缺乏鍛鍊。
How dramatic!
什麼狗血劇情！
Anyways, thanks for letting me share my passion for a bit.
總之，感謝你聽我說這麼多。
Here's how I enjoy these shows to the max, you should try it too.
這就是我充分享受這些電視劇的方式，你也可以試試。
Trash TV really is the best. Can't wait for the next episode.
肥皂劇真是太好看啦，下一集什麼時候播啊！
The TV shows a Dragon-tamer breaking up with a Lady in what seems like a staged moment.
電視上正在播出一位馴龍師和一位女士鬧分手的劇情。
If your Pokemon attacks the same target with the same attack, the damage will always be the same!
如果你的精靈以相同的技能，攻擊同一個目標，那麼傷害將始終一樣！
That means that if you're able to crunch the numbers, you can figure out how many attacks it'll take to knock out an opposing Pokemon!
所以你可以計算出需要多少招，才能擊敗對方的精靈!
Critical hits are the exception to this, of course.
如果擊中要害了另說。
It seems like Ribombee is helping organize the books!
蝶結萌虻正在幫忙整理書籍！
A book called "Gangs of Castelia" lays on the table.
桌上放著一本名叫《卡斯蒂利亞黑幫》的書。
A sticker on the front states that it was adapted into a major motion picture.
根據封標顯示，這本書曾被改編成電視劇。
Oh hello dearie, you wouldn't happen to be a Trainer would you?
哦，你好，你不會碰巧是訓練家吧？
My husband and I have decided to get another Fairy- type friend for our Ribombees and Cutieflies.
我和我的丈夫決定為我們店裡的萌虻們，找一隻新的妖精系夥伴。
We managed to go and catch a Milcery, but it's a little too shy for how busy we are.
我們抓了一隻小仙奶，但因為沒時間照顧它，導致相處得不算很親密。
If you have another Fairy-type, I think it'd be nice to have a little trade.
如果你有另一隻妖精系精靈，那我覺得來一次小小交換也很不錯（在箱子裡選擇精靈）。
Oh, alright. You tell me if you change your mind now.
哦，好吧。如果你改變主意了再告訴我。
Come back if you can find a Fairy-type!
你找到妖精系精靈後再來吧!
Oh this little one is perfect, I'm sure our regulars will love it.
哦，這小傢伙簡直完美，我相信我們的常客會喜歡它的。
Thank you dear, people will be excited to meet the new face here.
謝謝你，大家肯定會喜歡這個新面孔的。
Things are going well dear, your Pokemon has been quite the hit with our customers.
 一切都很順利，你的精靈很受我們顧客的歡迎。
Take care of the old mascot dear, I'm sure it hates being cooped up in a place like this.
另外還請你照顧好那隻小仙奶，或許它只是不喜歡被關在這裡吧。
Hey, you want a cup of coffee?
你好，要來杯咖啡嗎？
It's gonna cost you $250.
一共$250。
Sounds good. Come back when you want a cup.
什麼時候想喝了再來吧。
Thank you for your patronage.
謝謝惠顧。
Wow, you are broke. Go get some cash.
你破產了嗎？這裡需要現金支付。
Ribombee seems to really be enjoying the TV show.
蝶結萌虻好像真的很喜歡這個電視節目。
Me and my Obstagoon love to come here to read.
我和我的堵攔熊喜歡來這裡讀書。
Many people are surprised that an Obstagoon would like reading.
很多人對此感到吃驚。
I tell them not to judge a book by its cover!
我總是教訓他們不要以貌取熊！
It's a TV guide.
電視節目表。
You're surprised they still make these.
什麼年代了還有這玩意！
I hate reading. I don't even know why I come here.
我討厭讀書...我都不知道為什麼會來這裡。
The coffee isn't even that great...
咖啡也不怎麼好喝…
I have a younger brother who is very, very dense.
我弟弟真是太太太太奇怪了。
He's obsessed with water and the ocean. And especially with making metaphors about them.
他腦子裡全是水啊，海啊之類的東西，並且總喜歡拿這些做比喻。
He constantly talks about super weird stuff like "darkness" and "crushing pressure".
還老是講一些很怪的東西，比如“黑暗”“壓強”什麼的。
I'm not gonna rain on his his parade. It's just really weird that --
我不想潑他冷水，但這也太古怪了，畢竟...
...
。。。
Did I just use a water metaphor? Ugh, maybe it's rubbing off on me...
我剛剛是不是也用了水的比喻？我也要變奇怪了嗎...
Hundreds of comic books, magazines, and graphic novels line the shelves.
書架上擺放著數以百計的漫畫書、雜質和小說。
The adults don't let me swim in the pond, so I like to run down to the Eleig River.
大人們不讓我在池塘裡游泳，所以我就常去埃利格河。
But my shortcut there, the Gigalith's Guts, has a bunch of Avatars now.
但是現在怪巖腸道里有很多的化身，這條捷徑已經沒法走了。
It stinks!
好煩！
Many Trainers starting their Gym Challenge know that Burn can reduce an enemy Pokemon's Attack.
很多訓練家都知道。燒傷可以降低對手的攻擊。
But some Trainers still don't know that Frostbite reduces an enemy's Special Attack.
但是有些訓練家還不知道，凍傷會降低對手的特攻。
On top of this, Numb reduces all of a Pokemon's damage while being coupled with a Speed reduction.
此外，還有麻痺這個狀態，不只是減少精靈的速度，還能降低它所造成的所有傷害。
While it might be appealing to utilize Numb's flexibility, the specialized effects of Frostbite and Burn are stronger than that of Numb's.
雖說麻痺的效果聽起來厲害，但凍傷和燒傷的針對性更好。
Hey, interested in the Novo Battling Club?
嘿，對望新對戰俱樂部有興趣嗎？
If you haven't met him already, you can speak with Louis to participate in the battles.
如果你有興趣的話，可以去找路易斯談談。
Otherwise, take this, courtesy of the Café.
無論你的答覆為何，都請收下咖啡廳的心意。
Use that cookie to heal your Pokemon of any status condition -- even those that are Dizzy or Leeched!
使用這塊餅乾可以恢復你精靈的異常狀態 - 其中包括混亂和寄生！
Dizzy and Leech both have their uses, though some cases are better than others!
混亂和寄生都有各自的用處，在某些情況下起到逆轉戰局的效果！
Dizzy Pokemon have their abilities surpressed and take extra damage!
混亂狀態下精靈會失去其特性，還將受到更高的傷害！
Leeched Pokemon have their health stolen by their opponent! In a double battle, the healing is split between both opponents.
而處於寄生狀態的精靈將會被吸走自己的HP！如果是雙打對戰，這部分HP會平均分給兩個對手。
The atmosphere here is nice.
這裡的氛圍很好。
I should really come more often.
我真該多來幾次。
It seems like the Riolu is trying to reach for a book, but it's too short to grab it on its own.
利歐路好像想拿一本書，但以它的身高根本夠不到。
Do you want to help the Pokemon?
要幫利歐路嗎？
Maybe it'll figure a way out on its own.
得讓它學會自己想辦法。
You grab a copy of "The Adventures of Mighty Morpeko 6: Golduck's Great Revenge".
你順著它的目光拿了一本《強悍莫魯貝可歷險記6：哥達鴨的大復仇》。
The Riolu gives a polite bow while you hand it the book.
當你把書遞給它時，利歐路禮貌地鞠了一躬。
Riolu is really enjoying its comic book!
利歐路真的很喜歡這本漫畫。
No
不換

I can sense the life force of all living things.

What makes this chamber so fearful is that... I cannot sense a thing.

I'll have to report this failure back to my master.
我必須要跟我的主人報告這次失敗。
I could not find the elixir of legends.

I have vanquished all manner of monster to arrive here.
我戰勝了所有怪物，才來到這裡。

你的技術足以打敗我，我對你深表敬意。
But nothing happened...
但是什麼都沒發生...
I am camped out here.
我是在這裡紮營的。
There is no reason to be suspicious.
你不用懷疑我。
I had forgotten, but my camping spot is actually elsewhere.
哦，忘了，我的露營點不在這裡。
Please do not follow me.
不要跟著我。
Roasting smores. That is an aspect of camping that I enjoy.
露營最吸引我的地方，就在於營火！
I love flowers. Do you love flowers?
我很喜歡花，你喜歡嗎？
I must go. The reason certainly involves aromas, for that is what category of person I am.
我必須得走了，原因當然是跟花香有關，因為我就是這樣的人。
Smelling flowers. Their aroma. It is simply the best.
聞著花香，感受這種每秒。
The hike out here was quite nice. A battle will be a good way to end my trip. Let us begin now.
來這裡徒步旅行可太爽了，正好用一場戰鬥做個完美的收尾吧。
I assure you that my interest in hiking is very normal.
對遠足感興趣是件很正常的事。
To prove it, I will now hike away from here.
為了證明這一點，我現在就徒步離開這裡。
Battling is very similar to rock climbing, in that I partake in both.
戰鬥與攀巖，我都會參加。
Dialogue here.
說啥？
Trimmed metallic vines hang from the wall. There's not enough material to make anything further.
修剪過的金屬藤蔓掛載牆上，沒有足夠的材料製作更多東西。
Stop! The law states clearly that this is an illegal action!
停下你的違法行為，這裡暫時不允許通行！
A ranger station is above us, in Grouz. I know that because I saw it myself.
我們頭頂上就是古治鎮，因為我親眼看到了。
I will go there to report your illegal activities.
我會去舉報你的。
As an agent of the law, I am dissapointed that I was not able to overpower you.
很遺憾，作為執法者，我卻沒辦法制服你。
There was an entire cave of iron plants and no one mentioned it to me?
這麼大一個鐵樹洞，就沒人跟我講過？
Isn't that a little suspicious?
是不是很可疑？
But who among us knows the truth about what happened here?
但是，誰知道這裡的真相呢？
This whole place shouldn't exist. I can't find words to describe how I'm feeling.
這個地方感覺都不該存在，我無法用語言來形容這種感受。
It's like, a feeling of dread. That something is about to happen.
這就像是一種恐懼感，有什麼事情要發生一般。
That a few words could cause something to wake up.

Early Chasm reports talk about a metallic giant lurking among the trees.

Something they didn't expect to see here, so, I don't mean Registeel.
我覺得他們在這裡看到的事雷吉斯奇魯。
Maybe you'll be able to find it. Good luck.
或許你也能遇到，祝你好運。
Collecting a loss like that wasn't on my agenda.
我沒有把這種小損失放在心上。
[Map21]
One moment – there we go. I’m going to take notes this time.
稍等...好了，這次我會做筆記的。
I’ll admit it: I’m curious. What do you bring to the table that no other challenger does?
我承認，我很好奇。你身上有哪些其他挑戰者所沒有的點？
No matter what praise Tamarind or the others heap upon you, don’t let it go to your head.
無論塔瑪琳或者其他人對你的評價有多高，也不要被讚譽衝昏頭腦。
I’m rather more rigorous in my analyses.
我會更嚴謹地分析你的能力。
Let’s begin.
現在開始吧。
All of that work to get here and now you test my patience?
事已至此，你卻來考驗我的耐心？
Ugh. Go. I can work while you’re gone.
呃...行吧，我要繼續做工作了。
I reared Team Chasm from its infancy.
我把裂隙隊從襁褓中養大。
I turned this place from wilderness to a modern region.
在這個地區的荒郊野嶺裡，建立了一座座城鎮。
I am the beating heart of Makya.
我就是馬凱亞跳動的心臟。
Fine! One of us needs to be humbled. Show me which one of us it is.
看來今天我們之間，得有個人被搓搓銳氣了，你覺得會是誰呢？
Don’t expect this to be easy simply because I work from behind the scenes.
別以為我在幕後工作就好對付了。
I made this region what it is today.
是我讓這個地區變成了今天的樣子。
Show me what you can do – or are you just what you’ve inherited from Mavis? Show me!
你到底是有真材實料，還是僅靠梅維斯的名聲被吹捧出來的？就讓我好好見識一下吧！
No! I can’t – how? Eight years and I still can’t beat an arrogant child!
不！不可能！怎麼會...八年了，我竟然還是打不過一個狂妄的小鬼！
No, no, you and your Pokémon deserve the Patience Badge.
算了，算了，你和你的精靈配得上耐心徽章。
No, no, you and your Pokémon deserve that victory.
算了，算了，你和你的精靈配得上這場勝利。
Just do me a favor and beat Tamarind just as badly someday. You’re not the only one with a childish rivalry.
另外，答應我一件事，回頭找個時間，像今天打敗我一樣，狠狠地教訓一頓塔瑪琳，不是隻有你才有所謂的勁敵。
Although – and you may know where I’m going with this – there is one other thing...
另外...你可能已經知道我要說什麼了，沒錯，還有一件事...
My decision to not employ gym trainers is paying dividends.
看來不僱傭道館訓練家，的確有很多好處。
Now there’s no one to watch me keep losing.
起碼沒人會看到我輸。
Your victory was unexpected, but not undeserved.
你的勝利出乎意料，但又在情理之中。
You’re not the child I thought you were.
與我之前的想法多少有些不同。
I’m happy to give you this badge.
我很樂意給你這枚徽章。
Oh, and I would be very interested in another duel – there’s more for me to learn from you.
我很願意與你再來一場決鬥，這對我來說也很有幫助。
I’ll make the time, whenever you want to give me yours. Good day, \PN.

A screensaver image of a Luxray bounces lazily around the screen.
倫琴貓的屏保在屏幕上跳來跳去。
Yo, champ in the making!
你好，未來的冠軍！
Helena runs a tight ship around here.
海倫娜對這裡的管理非常嚴格。
Even I can't get away with just standing around all day!
就算是我也不能整天站著做招待！
Helena understands that efficiency comes from information, and information from the flow of communication.
她的理念是“效率來源於情報，情報來源於溝通與流動。”
That's why she's focused her gym around Electric-type and Water-type Pokemon!
因此，作為她的道館，這裡專精的也是電系和水系精靈！
They're a strong pair in battles, sharing no weaknesses.
這是兩種配合起來很強力的屬性，它們沒有共同的弱點。
Firstly, Grass-type Pokemon are your best bet against her, since they're strong against Water- types, and resist Electric.
草屬性精靈一定是最優選，既能剋制水系，也能抵抗電系。
Secondarily, Dragon-type Pokemon will resist both Water and Electric.
再就是龍屬性，可以同時抵抗水系和電系攻擊。
Finally, mirroring her with Electric-type Pokemon of your own can work well too.
再有，如果你也使用電系，或許也能很好地反制她。
They're strong against Water-types, and resist Electric.
在某些情況下，電系也能起到與草系差不多的作用。
Hope that helps!
希望這些對你有用！
You out-maneuvered Team Chasm's best strategist!
你靠著策略擊敗了裂隙隊最強的戰術家！
Congratulations, I hope you feel good about that one!
恭喜啊，希望你能好好享受此刻的心情！
We were initially hesitant to partake in constructing gyms, but we chose to do so for two reasons.
我們一開始對是否建造這座道館有些猶豫，但考慮到兩點還是這樣做了。
Firstly, it provided legitimacy.
第一，是為了合法性。
Secondly, it allowed us to find exceptional trainers such as yourself.
第二，是為了能夠遇到一些，像你這樣優秀的訓練家。
I would like you to take this key, with the understanding that through the door it unlocks is a particularly dangerous avatar.
我希望你能拿上這把鑰匙，同時你也要清楚地意識到，門後面是一個格外危險的化身。
Obliterate it. Show me that our search is over.
只要將它消滅掉，這裡的危機就解除了。
You'll find the problem at the north wall of Team Chasm HQ. Well, former HQ.
你可以在裂隙隊前總部的北牆上找到一扇那種特殊的門，記住，是前總部。
The avatar still exists. I’m patient, but I would be lying if I said I didn’t yearn for the day it was gone.
這個化身不會脫困的，雖然我有耐心，但也想盡快消滅它。
It is my most-despised responsibility.
我很討厭這種責任。
Search the north wall of Team Chasm HQ.
記得去查看裂隙隊前總部的北牆。
It’s gone?
把它消滅了？
I never thought I’d share Andris’s joy in seeing a problem -- how would he put it? -- deep-sixed, but this does feel good.
沒想到我會跟安德里斯一樣，在問題解決時感到這麼興奮...用他的話怎麼說來著？啊，終於搞定了，舒暢！
Thank you. That’s a weight off of my shoulders, not to mention proof my idea worked.
謝謝你讓我卸掉了身上的負擔，同時證明了我想法的可行性。
Good day, \PN.
祝你好運，\PN。
And thank you.
謝謝。
Oh... good. You.
哦！哦...是你。
I’m going to be honest: I’m not really a fan.
實話實說，我並不是很想看到你。
Oh, don’t take it personally. I don’t like anyone around here.
別想太多，我只是討厭這裡的一切罷了。
As soon as I’ve got my fortune, I’m leaving this damned region behind.
等我攢了足夠的錢，就會離開這個該死的地方。
I’m going to live on a megayacht in the warm Alolan waters, writing semi-autobiographical erotica under a penname.
我打算隱居在溫暖的阿羅拉，在附近買一艘遊艇做住所，取個筆名寫寫半自傳體的小黃書。
And I never have to think about any of you ever again.
這樣我就不用想起包括你在內的，這裡的所有人了。
Well, maybe I’ll invite Tamarind. Just to rub it in her face, of course. Of course...
呃...或許我會寫塔瑪琳？當然，她必然是丑角，必然...
Not yet.
稍等
Let's.
來吧

Dialogue here.
在此停下。
Your Pokemon are now healed.
你的精靈已經痊癒。

[Map25]
Presenting, my very own Normal-type attack!
介紹一下，這是我的獨創的一般系技能！
Is it Physical, you ask? Special, perhaps? It's both, of course!
物理還是特殊？那當然兩者都有！
Your Pokemon uses whichever is best for their stats!
適應之力聽說過嗎？這招會根據精靈的能力值以更高傷害的形態出擊！
Is there a catch, hmmm? ...Yes...the move misses 30 percent of the time.
有沒有什麼副作用？嗯…有，失手的機率略高一點。
Whaddya say? Nearly every Normal-type Pokemon can be taught this move, and even a few others.
你覺得怎麼樣？幾乎每隻一般系的精靈都可以學會這個技能，某些別的精靈也能學。
Truly you've struck the motherload of moves!
你可是學到了一項前所未有的神技！
Fine... I just wanted something to do now that the mine's closed...
好吧…現在礦場關了，我只是想找點事情做罷了。
What're you doing?!
你在幹什麼？
You're \PN, right? The trainer the Professor called in?
你是\PN，對吧？博士叫來的訓練家？
So go destroy that Avatar before we're all killed!
那就在大家被殺死前，幹掉那個化身吧！
I used to use a lot of Life Orbs. Didn't care if my Pokemon got hurt so long as they did the work.
我以前只在乎能否完成任務，不在意精靈們是否會受傷，所以經常使用生命寶珠。
But I'm not that kind of person any more. I'm looking to rid myself of them.
但我現在變了，我不想再那樣做了。
I've just got one left. I'll sell it to you for $6,000. Fair market value.
我只有一個了。6000美元賣給你，市場價。
Sounds good. I'll be on patrol for awhile now, so hit me up if you change your mind.
好的，如果你改變主意了，可以再聯繫我。我現在要進行巡邏了。
Here ya go, pleasure doing business.
很高興能與你達成這筆交易。
\PN hands over $6000 in exchange.
\PN遞出了6000美元作為交換。
Guess I'll go back on patrol now.
我要回去巡邏了。
Looks like you're a bit short on cash.
看來你手頭有點緊啊。
I get that, wasn't in the best financial spot myself before I joined Chasm.
我能理解，在加入裂隙隊之前我也沒啥錢。
Despite their pain, my team still loves battling.
曾經我的精靈們都生活地很痛苦，但它們依然在奮力戰鬥著。
To be honest, I don't deserve their forgiveness. I hurt them, but they still forgave me.
說實話，我不值得它們寬恕，我傷害了它們，但它們還是選擇原諒我。
I get a bit emotional everytime I think about it, haha.
每次想起這些都有點感慨，哈哈。

My my, I hope you aren't here to battle. I won't be able to tell my Pokemon anything if you keep taking my breath away.
你不會是來找我戰鬥的吧！連個喘氣的時間都不給，我還怎麼跟精靈們培養感情。
Oh, you are? Ah, I suppose a rose as pretty as you would have some very sharp thorns...
你的確是為了戰鬥而來嗎？好吧，但要小心哦，漂亮的玫瑰都有著銳利的尖刺...
I laid out each of these starter tokens to maybe attract someone suitable... for battle.
我在這裡留下了三枚代幣，來作為對戰的獎勵。
Perhaps you'll be able to satisfy both criteria...
就看你能不能達成我的條件了...
The top of the sign is labeled "Grouz Mine Bulletin."
最上面一層是“古治礦場公告。”
Remnants of old, yellowed papers are still stapled to the rest.
邊邊角角處還能看到一些老舊發黃的殘留碎紙片。
What a disgrace.
真丟人。
We're supposed to be keeping this area safe.
我們應該保護這裡的安全的。
A call for you, Trainer.
你的電話，訓練家。
The ranger hands you a cell phone.
義軍成員將手機遞給你。
Heard a certain metal worm is no longer with us. You won’t see me at the funeral.
聽說某條金屬蟲子已經被解決了？它的葬禮我就不出席了。
Anyways, I’m a woman of my word – I’ll be your friend in high places.
總之，我是個言而有信的人，我會以我的身份給你些幫助。
I’m holed up in <imp>Helena’s place</imp>, west of the LuxTech eyesore.
我現在在<imp>海倫娜的地盤</imp>，從礙眼的光華市往西走。
North-west of the lake, can’t miss it.
這裡的東南方向有個湖，應該挺好找的。
Oh, and bring your team. I invited another guest.
對了，帶上你的精靈隊伍，我還邀請了另外一個客人。
Ah, where were you in the good ol’ days? You would’ve made a great grunt!
啊，為什麼那時候你不在這裡。你一定是一個優秀的士兵！
...That’s a compliment, by the way. See ya there.
...聽不懂無所謂，總之是句誇獎，到時再見。
You gotta keep sharp! Don’t tell me you’re sick of fights.
保持敏銳和警惕，別告訴我你已經厭倦對戰了。
Our guest’s pretty good, too. She might teach you a thing or two.
這個客人可是不可多得的，或許她還能教你兩招。
Well, see ya.
到時再見。
You think I’M bad? Try working with Helena for a few years. Especially back when she had strike teams at her disposal.
你覺得我很難相處？試著跟海倫娜公事幾年吧，尤其是她手下有軍隊的時候。
You’re strong. You’ve proven that. This’ll be a piece of cake. Trust me. So I’ll see ya there.
你已經證明了自己的實力，我覺得這場戰鬥對你來說不過小菜一碟，到時候見。
…She hung up.
…她掛斷了。
Thanks for the help.
謝謝。

The door is boarded up.
這扇門被木板封死了。
Hello, \PN. It’s been quite some time!
你好，\PN，好久不見!
Though I’ve heard tales of someone that looked like you talking to someone that looked like me by a certain river that I know a certain Ditto appreciates.
我聽說有人看到兩個長得很像我們的人，在那隻百變怪經常出沒的河邊聊天。
Well, I say that, but I suppose I’ve never verified that she is, in fact, a Ditto.
嗯，說歸說，但我還沒確定她到底是不是百變怪。
I have never seen her un-transformed, specifically.
我並沒見過她的原形。
I have tried tossing a Poké Ball at her, with no effect other than a withering glower.
之前朝她扔精靈球，除了得到了一個鄙視的眼神外，沒有任何效果。
She could be anything, I suppose, but what else can take human form for so long with such accuracy?
理論上講她可以是任何生物，但除了百變怪外，還有什麼能像她這樣維持這麼久的人形態？
A particularly persistent and vocal Zoroark? Perhaps some other Pokémon that learns Transform?
一隻能長時間維持變身且會說人話的索羅亞克？還是其他會變身技能的精靈？
Or perhaps she really is simply a doppelganger of eldritch origin, or a spirit haunting me for some forgotten transgression.
還是說她真的是來自另一個世界的我？又或是某個因為我的過錯而一直糾纏不休的鬼魂？
The one that gave you that amulet – not that it matters.
因為我給了你那個護身符...算了這不重要。
Don’t worry, I don’t take any offense! My doppelganger and I are more alike than we are different.
放心，我不會因為這而生氣，畢竟大家分不清也實屬正常。
How, precisely, would a Ditto learn to imitate my manners with such care...?
不過...百變怪又是怎麼模仿我的行為舉止的呢？
I suppose it bears little tangible relevance to my situation, though.
討論這些對我現在的處境並沒有實質性的意義。
Oh, I’m sorry I’m such a glum philosopher archetype.
抱歉，我是不是表現得太沉悶了？
If I must play a stock role in your story, I would prefer to be an oracle distributing wisdom, or a magical creature bestowing some blessing or artifact.
如果我真的要在你的故事中扮演一名角色，我更願意做散播智慧的先知，或是賜予祝福的精靈。
I hope you’re not expecting any wisdom or artifacts from me.
當然，希望你不要指望我真能提供什麼智慧或祝福。
I fear I’m far too invested in my own quest for self- discovery to aid you in yours.
我怕自己過於投入在自己的探求中而忽略了對你的幫助。
...Oh, that isn’t true. I can’t maintain a charade of indifference half as well as my companion. I am rather invested in you and yours.
不過實際上，這種可能不大，我對你的事情很感興趣，沒辦法像她那樣故作冷漠。
Thank you.
謝謝。
I could easily take the simple explanation afforded to all diviners: that I am interested in you because I have foretold some matter of interest in your future.
我只能簡單地告訴你：我預見了一些你未來會遇到的事。
Unfortunately, I am insufferably honest, so I must confess that I simply enjoy your company.
可惜，我實在不擅長撒謊，其實我只是喜歡與你一起的時光。
Indeed. You are plainly at the center of a whorl of causality here – it takes no arcana to determine that.
你現身處於因果漩渦之中，即便我不借助占卜也能看得出來。
I cannot ascertain the future with any degree of certainty, but I can plainly see which way the river cuts.
雖說我無法確定未來的結果，但能清楚地看到事物的發展趨勢。
I would like to liberate its path of hindrances if possible.
要是可能的話，我會試著掃平前方的阻礙。
Oh! Excuse me, I refer merely to my interest in seeing your rather unique path through fate’s weave come to pass.
啊！不好意思，我只是想見識一下你獨特的命格。
Well, that and a respectable appreciation for the quality of your character and company.
再就是我對你自身個性與品格欣賞。
It was not my intent to imply an interest in an... assignation, if that was what you were asking. Such passions are not my lot in life.
我沒有在暗示…感情方面，我的人生也不會有這種強烈的感情。
Consider it a professional curiosity, if that might ease your concerns... or insecurities.
如果我說這只是職業上的好奇...能緩解你的焦慮和不安嗎？
You are of note not merely for your personality and character –
不僅只是因為你的個性與品格...
though I confess some partiality to both – but for the briar-knot of fate you are embedded within.
我承認我的確喜歡你的這些特質...但關注你更多是因為你正深陷在命運的泥潭之中。
Many lives are wound around you. Around your fingers, or your throat, I wonder?
許多生命正與你緊密連結在一起，究竟是被你握於手中呢，還是緊緊地扼住了你的喉嚨呢？
Put plainly, you’re important, I’m curious, and I like our conversations.
簡單來講就是 - 你很重要！而我，對你這份重要感到好奇，再就是我也很喜歡與你交流。
Even the ones I am not privy to I imagine are enlightening for my other half, and her revelations may lead to my own.
即便是命運中無法得知的細節，也會作為對她的啟示而存在，我也可以在其中參悟良多。
Speaking of which, I am not merely here for pleasure. I had returned home for the express purpose of finding some clue as to my past.
其實，我到這裡，並不是來旅行的。大部分內容，我都記不起來了，只知道這裡是我的故鄉...
I... cannot remember it. That this is my hometown, yes, and stray faint recollections from my youth, but beyond that nothing.
我只保留著一段模糊的，青年時期的回憶，而我回來這裡，就是為了找尋關於我過去的線索。
Not until a comparatively luminous memory of riding on a train with my imitator at my side.
直到在來這邊的火車上與我的模仿者並肩而坐時，我才想起一段相對清晰的記憶。
Whatever had happened before that leg of our journey, I do not remember.
但在這段旅程之外的內容，依然是一片空白。
I only know that I am real, she is false, and I journey to prove such.
我只知道我是真的，她是假的，我接下來的旅程，也是為了證明這一點。
Not at all. But I must keep the faith.
沒有任何證據，但我必須堅持這個信念。
After all, if I am merely some animal that has deluded itself into humanity... well, the ethical quandaries alone would drive me mad.
畢竟，如果我只是某種...把自己視為人類的動物...單是倫理問題就能把我逼瘋。
Oh, plenty. Scraps of childhood, as I said. Being on the train is the first full memory of my modern era.
就像我之前說的那樣，有一些關於青年時期的零散片段，而火車上的相遇是第一段完整的記憶。
And from there, my memory is mostly whole – though the persistence and clarity of memory is something ethereal and unquantifiable.
從那之後我的記憶就基本正常了，當然，這只是我自己的感覺，我也不確定其他人的記憶是不是更穩定、清晰。
Perhaps mine are fragmented and faded compared to most.
畢竟我們永遠都沒辦法對此做出準確的比較。
She likes to elude me, and, though I am loathe to admit it, I her.
她總喜歡躲著我，雖然我不願承認，但我也躲著她。
It is rare we get more than a fleeting moment alone. Things are now... different, however.
我們很少會單獨待在一起，不過，現在...或許不一樣了。
Being here has driven my thoughts to doubt and darker places than that. I have found now answers.
來到這裡之後，我的思維就在懷疑之中，逐漸被引導進更為黑暗的地方，並找到了現在這些答案。
The other Imogene has already left, unable to bear it any longer.
而另一個伊莫珍受不了這些，便選擇離開這裡。
She left a note stating simply that she knew what she must do, and that she goes now to a place of death and quiet oblivion.
她留下了一張寫著去處的便條 - 去一個死亡之地，靜靜地等待被人遺忘。
I choose to interpret it as guidance to find a <imp>burial ground or mausoleum</imp>, and not as her last goodbyes...
我覺得她是打算前往<imp>類似墓地的地方</imp>，並不是做最後的告別...
I’m unsure if there is a difference for us.
我...我不確定我們到底有多少不同。
\PN… I don’t know that we should exist.
\PN…我甚至不知道我們是否應該存在。
There is something fundamentally wrong with us. Our state is not natural, nor is it tenable.
我們的本質存在著根本性的問題，我們的狀態既不自然，也難以為繼。
...Ignore my macabre ramblings.
...別在意我的胡言亂語。
I will follow her, and find the proof of my true existence.
我會跟著她，找出我是真實存在的那個的證據。
If you wish to bear witness to these revelations and watch as her lies crumble around her, come find us.
她知道的比我更多，所以我必須要弄清楚！
She knows something dire that I do not. I must know what it is.
如果你想親眼目睹真相，看到她的謊言四散瓦解，那就來找我們吧。
I'm trying to figure out why certain Avatars appear where they do.
我一直嘗試著弄明白，為什麼那些化身會出現在這裡。
They're often species that'd make sense for the local ecology, but not always.
它們看起來都是正常的物種，當然也不能這麼說。
Sometimes they're just.... somewhat off.
有時候它們只是...有些小變化。
Beats me.
想不明白。
I heard the stories, but it's still hard to believe that Avatars just... fade from existence when they're defeated.
雖然之前聽別人說過，但我還是很難相信，化身在被擊敗後就會消失。
When I saw that you were winning, I was mentally prepared to grab a pickaxe and begin the cleanup efforts.
看到你取得勝利之後，我就做好重新回到崗位上的準備了。
Ohoh, does another fly enter my trap?
哦，又有獵物飛進我的陷阱了？
Watch yourself, you may find yourself mesmerized.
小心，不要入迷了哦。
Tsk! It seems like you were too hot to handle.
嘖嘖，已經熱得有點受不了了。
Ah well, I suppose I could always ask Lainie to console me.
啊，我需要蘭妮的安慰。
A spark. A flash. A line of roses.
旋轉，跳躍，我閉著眼。
We should take our tango once more from the top.
或許我們應該再舞一曲。
But later, my dear.
但不是現在，親愛的。
I've found myself as a bit of a historian.
我算是一個歷史研究者吧。
I'm learning about important dates in history. The founding of Prizca, the fall of the monarchy.
我正在學習和研究這裡的史詩，比如宏禮市的建立、王朝的隕落。
All of them are fascinating, but I believe my favorite is the one we'll have, no?
歷史有著獨特的魅力，但我還是更喜歡即將擁有的未來，你呢？
I wanted to be a Water-type trainer before, but now I don't.
我之前想成為一名水屬性訓練家，但現在我改主意了。
That's because I caught this Tentacool. It's super dumb. It's so dumb that I quit being a Trainer.
就因為我抓到的這隻瑪瑙水母，它真是...蠢到我連訓練家都不想當了。
Maybe I'll want to be a Trainer again if I see a cool Water-type Pokemon, but if any Pokemon is as dumb as this Tentacool, I might die.
如果我能得到很酷的水系精靈，或許還會重燃夢想，但要是跟這瑪瑙水母一樣蠢，我可能剛進草叢就要死翹翹了。
Do you have a cool Water-type Pokemon that you could show me?
你有很酷的水系精靈嗎？可以給我看看嗎？
I'll give you my dumb Pokemon if you do.
只要你給我看看，我就把這隻水母送你了。
That's cool, maybe.
好的，我就稍微抱有一絲希望吧。
Oh. That's dumb. You are dumb.
呃，什麼蠢東西...跟你看起來一樣蠢！
Wow. That Water-type is pretty cool.
哇，這隻水系精靈也太酷了！
I still don't want to be a Trainer anymore.
但我還是不想當訓練家。
Take this dumb Tentacool because I don't want to see or think or hear or touch it again.
把這隻蠢貨水母帶走吧，我再也不想看到、想到、聽到或者觸摸到它了。
It is your dumb problem now.
現在這是你的蠢貨了。
Ok. I'll keep holding on to this dumb Pokemon.
好吧，就讓我繼續跟這個蠢貨待在一起吧。
Yeah.
好耶！解脫了！
Yes
學
No
不學
No thanks.
不買
Sure, I'll pay.
要了
Sure thing.

What do you mean?
什麼意思？
What else?
所以？

會不會你才是？
The feeling's mutual.
我也不能忽視你
Oh?
哦？
In... what way?
具體...哪方面？
Please don't be.
別別別
How sure are you?
你有多確定？
Any other memories?
你還記得些什麼？
Where is she now?
她現在在哪兒？
I'll show you one.
給你看看
Some other time.

What the...
真特麼...
Nevermind. Kid, I need some help.
小傢伙，我需要協助。
That thing needs to go down, and I’m fresh out of Pokémon.
我們必須趕快解決那東西，但我已經沒有可以出戰的精靈了。
Please. We can’t let it escape.
交給你了，絕不能讓它跑掉。
Don’t underestimate it.
還有，不要輕敵！
You'll need to send out <imp>two Pokemon at a time</imp> to even stand a chance.
只有<imp>同時派出兩隻精靈</imp>，才有擊敗它的機會。
I don’t have anything left. This is all on you.
我現在幫不上什麼忙，只能靠你了。
I can’t thank you enough. Honest.
真是非常感謝。
That thing was what we’re calling an <imp>Avatar</imp>.
那東西就是我們所說的<imp>化身</imp>。
They started showing up a few months back.
幾個月前，它們突然出現在野外...
It's rare to find a trainer that can take one on in a straight-up fight.
只有很少一部分訓練家有實力與它們正面相持。
I heard one showed up in here and figured I had to do something before it hurt anyone, but I got cocky.
之前聽說有這裡一隻化身，便打算在它傷人前消滅它，但我的準備沒有做足...
Lemme heal your Pokemon.
讓我幫忙治療你的精靈吧。
Anyways, the name’s Lambert.
還有，我叫蘭伯特。
I’ve got a feeling I’ll see you around the gym sometime soon, yeah?
想必我很快就會在道館見到你了，對吧？

You have me to thank for that, I put a decade of work into that beautiful machine.
這可都是我的功勞！我可是為了它付出了十年的心血。
My magnum opus. I probably don't have another one of those in me.
這是我的生涯中最傑出的作品，此生都很難再超越的作品！

I caught a Meowth during my tour to Galar, to build my cat collection.
我在去伽勒爾地區旅遊時捕捉了一隻喵喵，用來豐富我的貓咪收藏。

I've been thinking of adopting a new Pokemon. Another cat.
我一直在考慮領養一隻新的精靈，收集另一隻貓咪。
If you happen to have one, I'll trade you for this Galarian Meowth.
如果你正好有一隻，我可以用這隻伽勒爾喵喵跟你換。
Ah well. I guess I'll have to try finding a new owner online.
唉，看來我得試著在網上給它找個新主人了。

你覺得能打贏我了？希望你真的做好準備了！
You really are incredible! I'm bummed out after taking a stomping like that.
你真的很厲害，都要把我的自信給打沒了！
Seems like I bit off more than I could chew, but that isn't anything new. I'm off to find somewhere else to shack up.
或許我不該把自己逼得這麼緊？管他的，是時候前往下一站了。
A promise is a promise, have a grab at my loot. I'm down to rematch if you swing by again.

在這附近轉了好久了，一隻都沒能遇到！
If I had my <imp>MasterDex</imp> with me, I'd be able to find the exact spots where Pidgey gather.
可惜我沒帶<imp>大師圖鑑</imp>，不然就能查看它們的棲息地了。
If you can find one for me, I'll trade you this Pidove.
你能幫我找一隻嗎？我可以用這隻豆豆鴿跟你換。
Back to searching then!
那我自己慢慢找吧！
I just know there's got to be one somewhere on this island!
我只知道它們的棲息地在這座島上！
My collection grows!
收藏增加！
Well, time to head back to the mainland. I gotta remember to bring my MasterDex next time.
好了，是時候回大陸了。下次得記得帶上我的大師圖鑑。
Thanks for the help.

Makya has so much to offer a nature enthusiast like me.
馬凱亞對我這種自然愛好者來說，可是難得的寶藏。
Every place has a whole new batch of Pokemon to see!
每個地方的精靈都不同，有太多驚喜待我發現了！
This is a marked trail? Oh, well that ruins the fun.
一條標記好的小道？噫，那可就沒意思了。
Today, nature has brought a Trainer to clobber me.
今天，大自然派了一位訓練家，來這裡挑戰我。
Makyan biodiversity is amazing! It's a Pokéwatcher's dream!
馬凱亞的生態系統真是太頂了！對於精靈觀察家來說，這裡簡直是夢想中的世界！
Wow, you found me!

I'll be on the beach, see if you can... follow me and my trail!

Oh, look, another renegade to suppress.

Well, my beautiful arsenal? Are you ready to indulge yourselves?
好吧，我的軍械庫，你們準備好盡情放縱了麼?
...I don’t feel right. Something isn’t... I’m remembering things that I... didn’t do.
…我總感覺....哪裡不對勁…我想起來了...還沒有完成的事...
Come on, friends, weapons. I don’t want to... be a tyrant... tomorrow...
快點，夥計們，準備武器。我可不想…明天成為一個暴君…

How d’ya do, stranger? Sorry. Wish it didn’t have ta be like this, but… trainers are worth a pretty penny.
你好，陌生人，我也不想這樣，但…現在的訓練家真的很值錢。
Need to bring you in alive, so make it right easy for me, y'hear?
所以我要活捉你，請你配合，聽清楚了嗎？
You... I remember...
你…我想起來了…
Yez. \PN. I ain’t gonna beg... but... don’t let this happen... don’t let it have happened. I... I...
葉澤拉...\PN，我不會求人…但是...請阻止這件事發生...我...我...
Heh... if I’d caught ya, could’ve paid my debts. Gotten back in their good graces.
嘿...如果我抓到你，就可以還清我的債了，然後重新獲得他們的青睞。
Ah well. That ball won’t contain Eternatus long anyways. Gonna break out and end me sooner or later. Never had much of a hope...
哎呀，反正球也困不住那隻無極汰那太久。它遲早會逃出來殺了我的，我從來沒抱什麼希望…

There's nothing for you down there anymore.

My parents were really excited for my first Pokemon. They gave me a few Pokeballs and sent me on my way.
當我爸爸媽媽得知我即將擁有第一隻精靈時，都非常非常高興，還給了我好幾個精靈球。
But they were expecting me to get a Buneary or a Yamper or something, not a Vulpix.
但他們希望我得到的是卷卷耳或者來電汪之類的精靈，而不是六尾。
Apparently the Vulpix in this region are really mean. But not this one though, it's really nice!
聽說這個地區的六尾好像都很壞...但是這只不同，它很友好！
Even if it's nice, my parents aren't letting me keep it...
可就算是這樣，爸爸媽媽也不讓我留著它…
Can you trade me for a Buneary or a Yamper? I want a Pokemon my parents are happy with.
你願意用一隻卷卷耳或來電汪和我交換嗎？我想要換一隻能讓我爸爸媽媽滿意的精靈（在箱子裡選擇精靈）。
I don't want to just release this Pokemon into the wild...
我不想把它放生...
This Vulpix needs a good home! I'll be here if you change your mind!
這隻六尾需要一個溫馨的家！我會在這裡給它找一個好的主人！
Thank you thank you thank you!

Thanks, now I have a Pokemon my parents will be happy with.

Hey, you're a Trainer right? Please, I need your help.
嘿，你是個訓練家對吧？拜託我，我需要你的幫助。
My Growlithe got spooked when I was talking it for a walk.
我的卡蒂狗在上次出去散步時受到了驚嚇。
He ran off, and I wasn't able to find him again.
然後他就跑了，現在也沒回來。
He's lost somewhere in Repora Forest.
他有可能在枯槁森林裡迷路了。
Please find him, we've been together our entire lives.
請你幫忙去找找他吧，我這輩子不能沒有他！
Here is his Pokeball, and his favorite type of treat.
這是他的精靈球，還有他最喜歡的食物。
He's a smart boy, so all you need to do is show him the treat and he'll return to his Pokeball.
他是個聰明的孩子，只要你給他這些吃的，他就會自己回到精靈球裡去。
Have you found my Growlithe yet?
你找到我的卡蒂狗了嗎？
I'm sure he's just cowering in some corner...

You saved Growlithe! Thank you thank you thank you!

Trainers are amazing, aren't they Growlithe! Don't you want to become big and strong just like their Pokemon?
卡蒂狗，你也想要變強大嗎？或許...我也可以成為強大的訓練家！
Yeah! One day, I'll grow just as strong as you! I'll help people just like you did.
沒錯，總有一天，我會變得像你這樣強大，有能力去幫助別人。
Maybe the Rangers that are stationed here will help me get stronger!
或許我可以找這裡的義軍幫忙，他們應該有辦法讓我變強！
They fought tons of battles back when Team Chasm was around. They must be total vets!
裂隙隊還在的時候，他們打了無數場仗，個個都是戰鬥好手！

Lots of Pokemon that live in the sewers help with waste treatment.
許多生活在下水道中的精靈都可以協助分解廢料。
Too many Pokemon though, and the ecosystem might collapse.
但如果它們的數量過多的話，生態系統就有崩潰的風險。
We try to divert some waste to other places if we get too much of an influx.
所以我們會試著將一些廢料轉移到其他地方。
That way the population stays steady.
這樣就能維持種群數量的穩定了。
I like to spend time here instead of the breakroom.
相比於休息室，我更喜歡呆在這裡。
It's a lot quieter.
這裡安靜多了。

Bikes! Every Trainer worth their salt has a bike!

Using my bike to blast off at the speed of sound!

You see all those bikes behind me? They're the best you'll find, ever.
你看到我身後那些自行車了嗎？它們是馬凱亞最好的車。
I've been attending the festival every year since it was founded!
自從慶典開辦以來，我每年都來參加!
The Trainers here get better every year...
是這裡的訓練家一直在進步...
Or am I losing my edge?
還是我的實力下降了?
My my, you're a special one. Have you considered entering into the Tournament?
天啊，你很特別，考慮過參加競技大會嗎?
The Trainers this year are so intense.
今年的訓練家真是太捲了。
This person is too focused on watching the battle to notice you.
這個人看得過於專注，沒有注意到你。
West: Prizca West\nEast: Prizca East

Cool Trainers are so... cool!

I wanna be one someday!
我以後也要這樣！
Whoa whoa whoa there! You can't just stroll up to The Bench like that.
喂喂喂！你不能坐這把長椅！
This is The Bench, haven't ya heard? It's only got room for one winner, and that winner... is me.
你沒聽說過？這把長椅是屬於這裡的勝者的，而這個勝者...就是我！
Now I know that The Bench might be a bit intimidating for ya, so I've sweetened up the competition with a nice little relic I found.
我知道這長椅對你們來說，有很強的吸引力，更別說我還添加了一下小獎勵。
Heard it goes for a pretty penny, so it might be worth taking me on. Wanna go at it?
看起來價格不菲哦，你就不想試試嗎？
I've been stationed here to help in case of injury.
我被派到這裡是為了防止有人受傷。
Oh, I'm finally getting paged!

Something about a Bisharp.

I am at the World Tournament Festival, in Prizca.
我正在宏禮市參加世界錦標賽。
This plaza, right here, in the middle of Prizca, is where excellent Trainers come to battle, because it's cool.
在宏禮市中心的這個廣場，與來自各地的訓練家決一勝負。
Nobody, not me, not locals, not tourists, wants to stop battling.
無論是我，還是其他參賽者，沒有人想要就此止步。
Excellent shots. Check online in a few days, you might have just battled in front of a few million viewers.
這個鏡頭真不錯，過幾天去網上看看，說不定你就火了！
We have some good footage, but lets stick around to make a B-Roll.
雖然我們已經拍了一些很棒的鏡頭，但還是再多補拍一些吧。
Professional Trainers from around the world are gathering here.
來自世界各地的職業訓練家匯聚於此。
I'm technically a bit early, but it's worth it to see the best Makya has to offer.
雖然我來得早了些，但能看到馬凱亞最好的一面還是很值得的。
I'm a former Makyan Tournament Champion.
我曾是馬凱亞大賽的冠軍。
No no, not in my youth--the festival has only been going on for eight years!
不，我不是說年輕的時候...這個節日慶典才舉辦了八年!
You never know when you'll reach your prime.
你永遠不知道什麼時候是你的巔峰狀態。
Anyways, name's Ansel.
忘了介紹，我叫安塞爾。
It's just a hunch, but you seem like a Trainer that's looking for a good fight.
我感覺你很想來一場酣暢淋漓的對戰。
You might want to check in on the other Champions.
那你應該去周圍逛逛。
There's a few of us here in town.
這座城市除了我之外還有幾位前任冠軍。
Scilla's at the Ironclad Dojo, and Elise is always holed up in the Castle...
希拉在鋼鐵武館，而伊莉莎一般都在城堡裡...
Tell you what. If you manage to beat one of them in battle, I'll bring my team out of retirement for one last fight.
這樣說吧，如果你能打敗其中一人，那我就會叫回我退休的隊伍，與你一決勝負。
Until then, enjoy your journey! You only get to do it once.
在那之前，好好享受你的旅程吧！你只有一次機會。
You might want to check in on the other Former Champions. There's a few of us here in town.
如果你對其他前冠軍感興趣的話，可以在這座城市找找看。
Scilla's at the Ironclad Dojo, and Elise is always holed up by the Castle...
希拉一般在鋼鐵武館，而伊莉莎則通常在城堡裡...
If you manage to beat one of them in battle, I'll bring my team out of retirement for one last fight.
如果你打敗其中任意一人，我就會召回我的隊伍，與你一決勝負。
I've heard the news. A Trainer beating any of the Former Champions makes waves in our circles.
我聽說了，打敗任何一位前冠軍在我們的圈子裡都會引起轟動。
I've got a promise to keep \PN. Got my team back from a cushy retirement -- no small task!
我答應過\PN你。不過讓我的隊伍從舒適愜意的退休生活中回覆戰鬥狀態...這可不是件容易的事啊！
Wouldn't want to keep them waiting for too long. Fancy to give us one last skirmish?
我不想讓它們等太久，願意與我們一決勝負嗎？
I'm as antsy as a Durant. Get ready soon!
我跟杜蘭特一樣沒什麼耐心，快快準備好！
Then let's waste no time. Ready yourself!
那我們就別浪費時間了！
Ha! Haha! What a rush!
哈哈！太暢快了！
Two years of sitting on my bum would do that! I think my whole team is gonna feel sore tomorrow!
兩年沒訓練輸了也是正常！我感覺我的老夥計們明天都得腰痠背痛了！
You've done well, \PN. Any longer and I might have needed to call it quits early. Don't handle adrenaline well in my old age.
打的真不錯，\PN。要是再打久點，可能就得中間叫暫停了，我年紀擺在這裡，心臟受不了。
I'm sure you're not satisfied just a single battle from me, but that's all I got in me. Retirement's just a little too comfy!
我知道你還想多打幾場，但我只能奉陪到此，畢竟退休生活實在是太安逸了！
Let me make up for it. I'll ask Praveen to take my place.
不過作為補償，就讓普拉文替吧。
Child's got no respect for elders, but he's not a bad battler.
那小子雖說不尊重長輩，但他打得還不賴。
He'll probably be training in the Sandstone Estuary. No doubt he'll stop whatever he's doing to face you.
他現在可能在沙岩河口訓練，不過你放心，有架打的話，他肯定會立即停下手頭的事。
In the meantime, I need a nap. Farewell!
現在我要休息一會兒了，再見！
I love watching all the friendly matches that happen during the festival.
我喜歡戰鬥節慶典。
You get to see all sorts of battle strategies and team compositions.
在這裡能看到各種各樣的隊伍組合和戰鬥策略。
There's always something to learn.
總有能學到的東西。
I have more Flying-type Pokemon, but I left them back at home so I could diversify!
我有很多的飛行系精靈，但我把它們都留在家裡了，這樣增加我隊伍的多元性！
Actually, I should stick to types that I know...
或許，我應該堅持使用自己熟悉的屬性...
Maybe I need to find even more types!
也許我需要收集更多其他屬性的精靈！
Should I branch out into Electric-type? Fire-type?
電還是火呢？
The Tournament has been growing in size and prestige every year.
戰鬥節慶典的規模和聲勢每年都在上升。
Makyans have been battling here ever since Trainers became a thing.
自從訓練家這種職業出現，馬凱亞人就一直在這裡戰鬥。
However, it got seriously large and respected once LuxTech started pumped in a bunch of sponsor money.
當然那時候還沒有慶典這一說，聲勢和規模，自然是光華科技參與之後，逐年打上去的。
Wow, a wallhacker! #content
哇哦，穿牆哥！ #content
Any non-Trainers who walk through this Plaza, by accident of course, is in for a shock once they realize where they are.
任何非訓練家誤入這個廣場，一旦意識到自己在哪兒，肯定會大吃一驚。
Most Pokemon who wander through here are caught by Trainers unless they were already part of another Trainer's party.
如果是野生精靈出現在這裡，那它很快就會被抓住。
Evolution Market
進化市場
I'm trying to set up my stall, but this crowd won't leave!
我想擺攤，但這群人不肯離開!
Hopefully it'll all disperse eventually.
希望他們快點走。
Now that I'm done handing out those inventions, I can just relax here at the Battle Festival.
發明都已經分發完了，終於可以到戰鬥節慶典放鬆一下身心了。
I hope they have those new 3D Printers I saw advertised!
至於廣告上的新款3D打印機...大家應該都有吧！
I've got a whole fireworks thing planned for the Tournament.
我為大賽準備了一整套煙火表演。
This booth is a little side thing.
這個攤位是我的副業。
You cheated not only the game, but yourself.
你不僅欺騙了比賽，也欺騙了你自己。
You didn't grow.
你沒有成長。
You didn't improve.

You took a shortcut and gained nothing.
你走了一條捷徑，卻一無所獲。
You experienced a hollow victory. Nothing was risked and nothing was gained.

It's sad you don't know the difference.
可惜你理解不到其中的區別。
You're a natural on camera kid.
你在鏡頭前表現得很自然。
At least you seem like it.
至少我是這麼覺得的。
If you aren't, you better get used to it fast if you want to do well at the Tournament.
如果你只是在強裝鎮定的話，最好儘快適應它，不然很難在競技大會中取得好成績。
I always look forward to battling here each year.
我每年都在期待著今天。
Your team is so exciting to see! I'll be looking out for you.
你的隊伍真的很棒！我會關注你接下來的比試。
A fun battle! I hope we can do that again.
真是有趣的對戰！希望我們能再打一場。
You should come around again, I'm itching for a rematch.
你應該再和我打一場，我已經迫不及待了。
Hey hey, how's it hanging?
嗨，最近怎麼樣?
After taking that slamming I gotta go hit the routes for some training.
我剛剛被打擊到了，現在正考慮外出歷練。
But for now, I'm just a part of the crowd. Maybe you'll fight me again during the Tournament.
如今我只是一位普通觀眾了，或許我們之後還會在賽場上見面。
What about The Bench? Ah, I wouldn't worry. The Bench calls to people. Someone will answer The Bench eventually.
至於這張長椅？哈哈，它的吸引力會引誘下一個勝者來佔有它！
Hey, 'miring my team?
對我的隊伍很好奇？
Of course you are. You're looking at the current ruler of The Bench.
難怪，畢竟你現在面前的，就是長椅的現任統治者。
OK! OK! We got a winner here!
好！好！好！現在這裡出現了一位新的勝者!
The Bench is yours, treat it well. Feel the comfort of superiority flow through that seat.
這長椅是你的了，請善待它，感受這種上流的優越感吧。
Eyo, you beat me. But you didn't get me.
哎呀，你打贏了，但並沒有完全擊潰我。
Let's see if we can't get another round in. I ain't about to cede The Bench to any ol' schmuck.
找個時間我們再來一場吧，我可不想把長椅讓給一個弱者。
Hit me up again whenever, I'll be ready.
過會兒再來，我準備一下。
Alright, that'll get you sorted.
你現在可以自主行動了。
Crowd should disperse soon enough once the other guys tell 'em that the coronation is on hold.
只要大家得知加冕儀式暫停，人群很快就會散去。
Anyways, you should head over ASAP.
總之，你還是儘快過去吧。
Tamarind doesn't like when her requests take too long, believe me.
塔瑪琳一直不喜歡等別人。
It looks like it's resisting an urge to ignite the fireworks!
看樣子它在強忍著點燃煙花的衝動！
Seeing all kinds of Pokemon in one place is so cool!
能看到各種不同的精靈聚在一起真是太酷了！
Whew, that's enough battling for now. I'm gonna go sit down somewhere.
呼，打累了，我要找個地方休息下。
Your Pokemon are awesome! Let's battle again later.
你的精靈很厲害！我們待會再戰吧。
Your Pokemon are rad, I need to see them agian.
你的精靈太酷了，我想要再見識一次。
Aw man, I was late for the tournament and missed all the cool battles!
我了個大天了嘞！我遲到了，已經結束了！
At least the shops here in the Plaza are still open...
好在商店還營業...
Not right now.
稍等一下
Ready.

I was gonna just throw some Normal-types at you and call it a day, but I'd feel bad.
我本打算隨便給你幾隻一般系精靈應付應付的，但又覺得過意不去。
I had Andris pull some strings and... and that name means nothing to you, so forget I said anything.
所以就讓安德里斯托關係……反正你不認識這裡的人，我說了也沒用。
Point is, surprise! You get two starters: One standard three-stage Grass, Water or Fire, you know the drill, but also a Normal-type.
重點是，你的待遇比預想中要好，你可以獲得兩隻初始精靈：一隻是水火草屬性任選，還有一隻是一般系的精靈。

What are you waiting for? I got them laid out all nice and everything!
該給的該說的我都已經做完了，還不趕緊開始你自己的冒險去？
Didn't I say to leave me alone?
我說了別來打擾我！
Don't bother. I didn't have time to grab any room service.
裡面是空的，不用費盡心思找食物了，
Not that I'd let you have any either way.
就算有我也不會給你。
No
算了
Yes
選它
Not Now

I've been trying to learn every sport lately.
我最近一直在學習各項運動。
Judo, baseball, tennis, even lacrosse. I've managed to hold my own against players in each of them.
我會柔道、棒球、網球，甚至學會了長曲棍球 ，我現在在這些項目都有準職業水準。
It's a long but rewarding process. My next project is figure skating.
這是一個漫長但有回報的過程，我的下一個項目就是花樣滑冰。
That lady over there is killing it, so I'm trying to copy her movements.
那位女士的表現太出色了，所以我在試著模仿她的動作。
The lake here used to be pretty. The ice rink is nice, but it just doesn't have the same appeal.
以前這個湖非常漂亮，雖說天然的溜冰場也不錯，但我覺得沒有之前吸引力大！
I remember this place started freezing a few years back, right before Team Chasm disbanded.
大概是幾年前開始結冰的...就在裂隙隊解散前夕。
I wouldn't put it past them to be behind it, they got their hands in everything.
我懷疑是他們搞的鬼，畢竟他們什麼事都要插兩手。
I used to be a hockey player, so ice skating is something that was natural to me.
我以前是個曲棍球運動員，所以滑冰對我來說毫無難度。
But I have to admit, figure skaters have something figured out.
但我必須承認，花滑運動員還是有點東西的。
Doing tricks on the ice feels great.
在冰上做出那些動作真的很帶感！
Hey kid. If you're looking for your next adventure, I wouldn't advise going this way.
嘿，孩子，如果你準備前往下一站，那我不建議你走這條路。
An Avalugg avatar has appeared in the Ice Cave.
冰之洞穴裡出現了冰岩怪化身。
If you do go in, you legally absolve the Rangers and the Svait Rescue Operation of responsibility.
如果你執意要這麼做，那麼在你進去的一瞬間，義軍和霜皚救援隊就不需要再對你的人身安全負責了。
"Svait, experience an eternal snow season!"
"霜皚鎮，雪花市的姊妹城！"
"Sister of Icirrus City."
"體驗永恆的雪季！"
The Ice Cave is really a unique phenomenon. It spews out extremely cold air.
冰之洞窟裡噴出的寒冷氣流，改變了附近區域的氣候。
It cools the area down so much that we get snowfall most of the year.
所以這裡才會一年四季被冰雪覆蓋，這也是馬凱亞下雪最多的地方，必基爾納山山頂上還多。
In fact, we get more snow even than Mt. Kilna.
至於冰之洞窟形成的原因，只能說是大自然的鬼斧神工了。
East: County Park
東：國立公園
South: Repora Forest
南：枯槁森林
North: Ice Cave
北：冰之洞窟
I've been coming to this lake once a year for over thirty years now.
三十多年了，我每年都會來這個湖一次。
Seeing this place grow and change has been both strange and exciting.
看著這個地方不斷變化成長，感覺既奇怪又興奮。
The ice rink used to be a lake, yet it's entirely frozen now.
這個溜冰場以前是個湖，現在已經完全凍結實了。
This little pond stays unfrozen however.
但旁邊這個小池塘卻始終沒有結冰。
What could have caused such an abnormal change in temperature in such a concentrated area?
到底是什麼原因才讓這裡的氣候出現異常的？
Ugh. I don't really get how to do this whole ice skating thing.
啊...我真的不會滑冰...
ACHOO!
啊嚏！
I think I've also caught a cold...
好像還感冒了…
There you are.
給你。
I’ve had a chance to look more at the data on that USB.
我本有機會進一步查看U盤上的內容。
The people you got this from really didn’t bother to scrub anything off of it, huh?
我很懷疑之前拿到它的人，真的沒有刪除些什麼嗎？
I feel a little silly for spending all that time in the stacks.
我真是...太傻了，竟然在書堆裡花了那麼多時間。
All these findings and life's work worth of knowledge makes you feel very, very, small.
所有畢生心血換來的發現和知識，讓我覺得自己...非常...非常渺小。
Are they satisfied to just, never act on the knowledge that they’ve obtained?
難道他們就能忍得住，不去就這些知識而採取些行動嗎？
Hey. This might be an odd question, but…
哈，你或許覺得這個問題有些奇怪，但是...
Could you come and talk to me again when you have 4 or less Pokemon in your party?
這樣，你先放下至少兩隻精靈，然後再過來跟我談談吧。
I think it’d be best if you come back when you have 4 or less Pokemon in your party.
我覺得你最好先確保，隊伍裡少於四隻精靈再過來。
Great. Sorry.
非常抱歉。
Most trainers I’ve seen around the region only use parties of 4, so I felt a bit… Intimidated by your overwhelming strength.
因為我看到附近的訓練家，大多數都只有四隻精靈的隊伍...所以我對你壓倒性的力量有點...怕。
I have another possibly odd question for you.
另外...有個奇怪的問題要問你。
Have you ever caught a Legendary Pokemon before?
你抓到過傳說中的精靈嗎？
I was dreading that.
我擔心的就是這個。
I don’t think I have it in me to let you become a hoarder like Team Chasm was.
我不認為我希望你成為像裂隙隊那樣的“收集者”。
These are forces of nature you’re messing with. And they need to be respected as such.
我們既然要應對大自然的力量，也應當儘可能地尊重它們。
You need to know where you stand.
你要明白自己的立場。
You need to know your place.
你要明白自己的位置。
Oh, good. Right, yeah!
那太好了，真的！
That’d be ridiculous if you did. It’d be like owning an Avatar.
如果你真的得到那些力量，誰知道什麼時候又會有新的化身，或者類似化身的存在出現。
But… The Seekers were able to work with The Crafter to attain some sort of harmony with those.
不過...那些探索者如果...能夠跟它們打成某種合作關係...
Even if I can find beauty in the primalness… Somehow, humanity managed to take control.
那究竟是依靠什麼，才讓人類在自然的力量面前，逐漸掌控了一切的呢？
…If anyone should be worthy of inheriting the legacy of the Seekers, it's me.
…哼哼，如果有誰，有資格繼承他們的遺產，那非我莫屬了！
I’m the one who put in all the time reading the research here.
花了那麼多的時間研究報告，才使得一切得以重見天日。
I’m the one who picked their bones clean.
這一切都是我一直以來的努力！
If anyone should be worthy of inheriting the legacy of the Seekers, it's me.
…哼哼，如果有誰，有資格繼承他們的遺產，那非我莫屬了！
Even when I pull out all the stops, when I try my best to defang you, you bite down anyway.
我知道，即便我使盡渾身解數，想盡一切辦法要阻止你，你依然會跟過來的。
You’re not human… You know, for a moment, it really flashed in my mind that maybe I could do something with all of this.
我腦海中有一瞬間，甚至懷疑過，你到底是不是人類...甚至還考慮過能不能利用這一點。
That I could attain my own facsimile of overwhelming power...
考慮能不能得到這一份，能夠碾壓我的力量的摹本...
But you’re just too strong.
但你還是太強了。
I’m all bark and no bite…
而我，就是個只會叫的弱者…
I’m so sorry.
抱歉。
I don’t know what came over me, \PN. I really lost myself for a moment.
其實我也不清楚到底怎麼了，\PN，剛剛一瞬間...我彷彿失去了自己的意志。
Shows how easy it could’ve been for the Seekers and Team Chasm to let this go to their heads.
難怪當年的裂隙隊...還有探索者，有那麼多令人感覺疑惑又莽撞的行為。
Here, let me heal your team up.
來，讓我治療你的精靈。
Let’s go find what we came here for together.
然後一起去找這次的目的地吧。
Yes
抓過

You know what? I'd best be spending me money instead of losin' it!
早知道我就把錢花掉了，現在都便宜了你！
Well, there goes me shore leave money.
完了，休假資金沒了。
I developed a multi-hit attack during Lambert's self-defense course.
我在蘭伯特的防身術課堂上，學會了多重攻擊。
I don't get much chance to battle, though.
不過我根本沒什麼用上的機會。
Would you allow me the chance to teach my Multi Strike attack to your Pokemon?
需要我將多重攻擊教給你的某隻精靈嗎？
It should be simple enough for many Pokemon, mostly Normal-type.
很多精靈都能學會這招，尤其是一般系的那些。
Ah, excellent!
啊，太好了!
Ah, pardon my indulgence in even asking.
啊，打擾了。
Wait a minute sis! This loser doesn't even have two pokemon!
等下妹妹！這個菜雞連兩隻精靈都沒有！
Really? Teeheehee, get lost, loser.

我覺得自己還是很擅長對戰的！要不要見識一下？
You... You're quite the battler...\wt[20]

I-I'm going to leave now.
我...我得走了。
You, defeat me? My goodness!
這...怎麼可能？我...輸了？
Wow, you found me again!
哇，你又找到我了！
A loss is a loss, I guess I owe you that second TM now.
輸了就是輸了，這個技能機也給你了。
I'll head back to town now. That was a fun game. I'm pretty worked up, hehe.
真好玩！嘿嘿！不過現在我要回去了，今天好開心！
Wow, you got here fast!
哇，你來得真快！
It's me again, with another sweet invention.
又是我，帶著另一個酷炫的發明。
This one goes back to the Team Chasm days.
這東西可以追溯到裂谷隊的時代。
Found a bunch in an old storage container.
我在一箇舊儲物箱裡找到了一堆。
It’s a way to <imp>read up on an opponent’s team</imp> before trying to take them on.
它可以在挑戰對手之前<imp>查看對手的隊伍</imp>。
I know, I know... the name is a bit silly. The thing doesn't even use X-rays.
我知道，我知道……名字有點傻。這東西甚至不用X光。
Anyways... my next stop will be on the mainland.
總之……我的下一站是大陸。
Here's hoping we run into each other there.
希望我們能在那裡再見面。
See ya.
再見。

Each Pokemon has their own Personality Traits.
每隻精靈都有自己的獨特之處。
Bonding with a Pokemon, and discovering what makes them unique, can be such a source of joy.
發現它們的優勢，與它們建立起緊密的羈絆，就是旅途上最快樂的事。
Don't worry about your battles. No matter the personality, any Pokemon can be an excellent battler.
另外，不要畏懼對戰，無論你擁有怎樣的精靈，它們都可以在戰鬥中發揮作用。
Use whatever Pokemon you connect with the most.
所以盡請使用你更喜歡的孩子吧。
Hello, and welcome to the Casaba Villa Pokécenter!
歡迎來到甜瓜精靈中心！
Oh, you're new to Makya, are you?
你是剛剛來到馬凱亞嗎？
An emergency measure was introduced recently to help trainers who might be in danger from avatar attacks.
因為最近化身肆虐，為了幫助訓練家們應對威脅，上面出臺了一項緊急政策。
According to that new measure, I'm supposed to give you this.
根據規定，這個是你的了。
Use this Aid Kit to heal your entire party!
這是一個急救包，可以讓你的精靈恢復健康！
Fainted Pokemon will be revived, their statuses will be healed, and their PP will be restored as well.
瀕死狀態的精靈會恢復活力，其他的異常狀態也可以消除，就連技能PP也會回滿。
It has a limited number of uses, but any nurse or other healer you meet will restore its supplies back up to full!
雖然使用次數有限，但每一位醫護人員都會幫你恢復它的使用次數。
Thank you for your patience while I explained all of that.
感謝你配合我的工作。

接下來我會繼續我的本職工作。
Oh, a trainer are you?
哦，你是訓練家嗎？
Would you be interested in taking my Sandshrew?
你有興趣收下我的穿山鼠嗎？
I brought it here from Alola, but I'm far too old to travel now, and it's getting restless.
我從阿羅拉帶來了它，但現在我年紀太大沒法旅行了，它也開始焦躁不安。
I'd need $5000 in return. Sorry, but I've got to survive somehow!
我需要5000美元作為回報。抱歉，但我得想辦法活下去！
What do you say?

After beating the seventh gym, I decided that me and the team needed a vacation.

我真的很抱歉，但你有多餘的藥嗎?
I’ve got a Pokémon that needs fixing up, and, uh, it’s pretty bad.
我有隻精靈需要治療，它現在的情況很糟糕。
Uh, well – listen, if you promise to share I’ll let it out of its ball.
呃...好吧，只要你答應幫忙，我就把它從球裡放出來。
I can’t take it to a Pokécenter because… you’ll see.
我沒法把它帶到精靈中心，因為...你會明白的。
You hand over some of your Aid Kit medicine.
將急救包裡的一些藥遞給他。
You hand over a Fresh Water.
將一瓶美味之水給他。
Oh, uh, you, uh… you don’t have any either.
哦，呃，你，呃...好吧，你也沒有。
Sorry to bother you. Guess you’ve got your own issues. G’luck.
抱歉打擾了，我猜你也有自己的難處，祝你好運。

I gotta figure something out now. I’ll – I’ll get by.
我現在得想個辦法，我...我會熬過去的。
G’luck.
祝你好運。
This is why I didn’t just go to a Pokécenter.
這就是我沒有直接去精靈中心的原因。
It’s a Phione. Don’t bother looking it up in your 'dex – they aren’t even real.
它是一隻霏歐納，不用在圖鑑裡找了，它們理論上只存在於神話中。
Least, that’s what people say. Just a myth.
反正大家都這麼說。
And, y’know how Makya is – I wasn’t about to show it off in public.
你應該大概知道馬凱亞的風氣是什麼樣的了吧？我可不想讓太多人看到它。
Here, let’s get ya fixed up…
來吧，讓我包紮一下…
Dumb luck. Stumbled across a Manaphy one night and it gave me an egg.
純屬運氣，那天晚上，我偶然遇到了一隻瑪納霏，它給了我一枚蛋。
Didn't know if I was cut out for that, but couldn't exactly turn it down.
我不知道我能不能照顧它，但是也說不出拒絕的話。
Figured it was a chance to do right, y’know?
我覺得這是做好事的機會。
Phione? They’re the children of Manaphy.
霏歐納？它是瑪納霏的孩子。
That’s what I’ve heard anyways. Can’t find any solid records online of someone catching one.
反正我也是聽說的，在網上找不到什麼可靠記錄。
Not everyone even believes they exist. But, uh, hey, this one’s real.
甚至很多人都不相信它真實存在，但顯然，它是真實的。
Well, you helped me out, didn’t you?
對，並且你也幫助我了，不是嗎？
Don’t really seem like a Pokémon thief to me. So, yeah, I guess I trust you.
我看得出你不像那些小偷，所以就向你尋求幫助了。
I was trying to train it up, but it’s a pretty fragile little thing.
我試著訓練它戰鬥，但是它好像並不擅長這些。
Didn’t hatch all that long ago, and, well… I’m used to training hardier Pokémon.
一是它剛孵出來沒多久...二是我習慣了訓練強大的精靈。
Still trying to learn to be a li’l more gentle, you know?
我應該試著變得溫柔一點。
Wait, guess I haven’t actually introduced myself.
對了，我還沒自我介紹呢。
My name’s <imp>Eifion</imp>, and this is my Phione. How about you?
我叫<imp>艾維恩</imp>，它你已經知道了，我的霏歐納。你呢?
…Well, \PN, it’s nice meeting you.

You too, \pfp. I should be heading out, but thank you, seriously. You bailed me out big time here.

Won’t forget it. See you around!
我不會忘記今天的一切，後會有期!

Sorry, I thought you were an Avatar!
抱歉，我還以為是化身...
I was so stupid, I thought I could win against the Beartic that's blocking the way down there.
我真是太自大了，本以為能打敗那隻凍原熊。
It wiped out my whole team.
結果我的精靈都失去戰鬥力了。
You handled that Beartic with ease, incredible!
你竟然能解決那隻凍原熊，真是太厲害了！
You didn't risk it just to help me, did you?
你冒這個險不是為了幫我吧?
Well, this is awkward...
嗯，這可真是尷尬啊...
Abraporter, activate!
凱西傳送器，啟動！
You really did a number on that avatar.
你解決了那隻化身？
Can't afford to be trapped in here, since I got this Origin Ore to fence.
我可不能被困在這裡，我還得賣了這塊起源礦石。
Yeah, I stole it. What of it?
你沒猜錯，是我偷的，但是又能怎樣？
Or maybe you're interested?

一口價$5000，因為我看你還挺順眼的。
Your loss.

You looking for the missing package?
你在找丟失的包裹？
Too bad, I'm gonna find it first!
哼，我會率先找到的！
I'm here unofficially, so there won't be any paper trail linking me to this fiasco.
一次非正式的戰鬥而已，不會有任何一張紙記錄我的敗北。
Wait, paper trail? Hmm...

All of this could have been avoided with better planning...
如果我再考慮地周密一點...

一些散落在地上的紙張，上面印有光華科技的標誌。
I've been waiting for days to do maintenance on these lights.

Wasn't gonna risk it with that Avatar making its home here.
我可不想冒險靠近那個化身。
I appreciate you taking care of that for me!
謝謝你幫我解決掉它！
Leaving through -- oh. You -- you’re looking for something down here.
我正要離開這裡——哦。你——你在這裡找什麼東西。

嘿，未來的冠軍！
Lambert's gym is inspired by his old days of breaking up brawls and knockin' skulls!
這個道館是館主蘭伯特根據以前在街頭幹架的親身經歷設計出來的！
Therefore his gym focuses on Fighting-type and Dark-type Pokemon.
所以，這裡是格鬥和惡屬性的道館。
You're new to Makya, right? Focusing on two types is standard for gyms in this region.
你是剛來馬凱亞的吧？這個地區道館一般都會使用兩種屬性的精靈。
If you want to take Lambert to task, Fairy-type Pokemon are your best bet.
說回到蘭伯特這邊，要想更輕鬆地對付他，妖精屬性無疑是你的最佳選項。
Bug-type and Flying-type Pokemon are also useful!
當然蟲系和飛行系也不錯！
Hope that helps!
希望這些情報能幫到你！
You knocked some sense into him.
你把他打醒了。
Congrats!
恭喜！
Hey! We've got standards here, so show me some real talent or get out!
在這裡就要遵守規矩，向我展示你真正的實力，不然就滾蛋！
Oh, Lambert's in for a real shock when he faces you! Wish I could see it!
哈，蘭伯特肯定會對你的實力大吃一驚的，有好戲看咯！
Ouch! You didn't have to go that far, y'know...
呵呵，顯然你沒必要繼續前進了…
Go on! I'll be back after I'm done pitying myself!
走開！讓我自己緩一會兒！
You looking for a rematch? I’ll oblige you.
想要再來一局嗎？
Ah, so you made it to me. Congrats.
啊，你終於來了，首先恭喜你。
Now, uh, things work a little differently ‘round here. Us gym leaders ain’t about to pull any punches.
其次，這裡的道館挑戰稍有些不同，我們可不會吝惜自己的拳頭。
Our teams have some bite to them, so make sure you’re ready before you try and take me on in a brawl.
我們的隊伍肯定有很強的攻擊力，所以你在挑戰之前，一定要做好相應的準備。
So, what can I do you for? You ready for a proper fight?
現在，你準備好了嗎？
Ah, you’re killing me. Well, c’mon back when you’re ready.
哈？那你來幹什麼？等你做好準備再來吧。
Oh, I’ve got a good feeling about this bout.
我對這場比賽很有信心。
You ain’t facing Gym Leader Lambert today.
你今天面對的不是道館館主蘭伯特。
No, this is former Team Chasm Captain Lambert, at your service.
前裂隙隊部長蘭伯特，接受你的挑戰。
Let’s dance!
讓我們起舞吧！
Good choice. Well, up until now we’ve been best buds, but it’s time to show you what Makya’s taught me.
明智的選擇。在此之前，我們是並肩作戰的夥伴，但現在，我要向你展示我在馬凱亞的畢生所學了。
I haven’t gone soft just yet.
燃燒吧，我的鬥志！
Ready? Go!
準備好了嗎？
I don’t know what to say. That was -- you’re the best trainer I’ve ever faced, and that’s including the kid that dismantled our entire Team.
我不知道該說什麼好了。你剛才的表現簡直離譜，比我見過的任何一位訓練家都要強，包括那個解散我們組織的臭丫頭。
You <i> dropped </i> me, like it wasn’t even a struggle.
整場戰鬥都在你的<i>掌控</i>之中，我現在馬後炮都找不出獲勝的可能。
Take it -- it’s the Loyalty Badge.
收下它吧 - 這是忠誠徽章。
I’ll heal up your Pokémon and get out of your way.
我會幫你的精靈恢復狀態。
Actually... let's go talk at my house.
另外...去我家聊聊吧。
Well, you sure proved yourself this time. Feels like you could take on my entire team and then some.
哇，你現在也太特喵強了。我感覺就算再多幾隻精靈也不夠你打的。
Want me to call up some of my old buddies next time? Oh, whatever.
下次需要我召集一些老夥計一起嗎？算了，那不太好...
Let me heal your Pokémon, and why don’t you let me brood over how humiliating this is.
讓我來治癒你的精靈吧，順便體味一下今天有多丟人。
Impressive. You’re a damn sight better than most of the folks ‘round here.
真不錯，你的實力已經足夠強了。
Might even be Champion material.
說不定你還真是冠軍的料。
Let me get your Pokémon back into tip-top shape.
但現在還是先讓我幫你治療一下精靈吧。
As for you, here: the Loyalty Badge. It ain’t much, but you earned it.
給，這個就是忠誠徽章，雖說不是什麼大不了的東西，但也是你用實力贏得的。
Come see me again some time. I’m itching for a rematch.
什麼時候有空了可以再來找我，不再來一場可沒法讓我滿足。
The door is securely locked.
這扇門上鎖了。

Is what I would say. In the modern day my services are no longer needed by trainers.

她平時總一個人呆著洞穴裡，直到有天她後面跟著一隻小幼基拉斯。
That little bastard grew up to be Autochthon. The others she caught who knows where.
那個小混球長大後就是現在的泥蛋了，至於她自己收服的精靈我就不清楚具體狀況了。
Oh, that. Yezera never did get along with humans so well.
說到這個，葉澤拉從來都不太喜歡和人們相處。
Could barely handle going to school. It wasn’t until she started adventuring that she made a friend.
她完全無法適應學校的生活，直到開始冒險後，她才交到了一個朋友。
Alessa – maybe you’ve seen her? Good kid.
阿萊莎...或許你見過她？她是個好孩子。
Yezera always did disappear when she got stressed, though. Nowadays is no different.
不過在葉澤拉有壓力的時候，她總會突然消失，包括現在。
Wish she could talk to me... but I’m no different than every other human, I s’pose.
我也希望葉澤拉能和我多聊聊她自己的想法...但我想我和其他人類似乎並沒有什麼不同。

Woah there Trainer, you're 'miring Makya's top professional fish wrestler.
哇哦，訓練家，你正在和馬凱亞最頂尖的職業魚類摔跤手打說話。
I'm all the brawn I'd ever need, but my operation could use an injection of brains.
我的肌肉已經足夠發達了，但我終於意識到在行動中還需要一點頭腦。
I'm thinkin' a Psychic-type 'mon might do the trick.
也許那些超能屬性的精靈就能幫到我？
You got one of those on hand? I'll trade you my latest dub: a Remoraid.
你有這樣的精靈嗎？我可以用我最近捕獲的鐵炮魚和你交換（在箱子裡選擇精靈）。
Your loss. There's more fish out there. And I wrestle them for a living.
那就算了吧，那裡還有很多魚，而我靠與它們摔跤為生。
You ain't got a smart-pants to part with?
你就沒有一隻聰明的精靈嗎？
A damn shame.
真是太遺憾了。
How do I make a living wrestling fish?
我怎麼與魚靠摔跤為生?
Hah, that's a good question.
哈，這是個好問題。
Farewell, my friend. I'll be out in the waters.
再見了，我的朋友。我要到水裡去了。
I wonder if I can teach this 'mon how to wrestle...
我在想能不能教這隻精靈摔跤...
I don't want to be picking flowers! I want to be ominous and creepy for a villainous master! Here, let me show you!
我不想再做摘花的小女孩了！我要變成陰森可怖的邪惡大魔王！來，讓我給你瞧瞧吧!
Wow! Do you, by chance, have need of an ominous fighting maid for your mansion? No? Fine, I'll go.
哇！你需不需要一位神祕的戰鬥女僕來保衛城堡呢？不需要？那...好吧...那我走。
Aww. Maybe if I was a better trainer Team Chasm wouldn't've collapsed...
唉，如果我能更強一些，裂隙隊就不會解散了...
These graves have been here since before Team Chasm. I didn't let them poke around here, and I won't let you!
這些墳墓早在裂隙隊成立之前就存在了。我不允許他們來冒犯這裡，還有你也一樣！
Maybe the spirits would return to their slumber if I stopped attacking people in their home... my apologies.
也許如果我停手，那些幽靈會回到它們的安息之地……對不起了。
Fine! If the spirits take you away, don't come crying to me!
好啊！如果鬼魂把你帶走，可別來找我哭!！
Behold! The power of sea, air, and land!
見識下海陸空的力量吧！
The way I see it, the ocean is surrounded. What's under the ocean? That's right, more earth.
在我看來，海洋才是被包圍的，你想想，在海底更下面是什麼？沒錯，是更多陸地！
Woe befalls me! Even with the power of nature at my call, I still fail!
真不幸，即便有大自然的力量，我還是輸了！
To become a true master, one must bond with mons from all walks of life.
要想成為真正的高手，就必須對各方各面都有所瞭解。
Or swims of life, or flaps of life.
無論是生命的遊動還是翻飛。
Guarding the bridge seems kinda pointless now that you can do that, huh?
既然你能做到這種地步，那我守橋就沒有任何意義了。
Hey, no trying to distract me from my job!
嘿，別想讓我分心！
Call me the 'sue' chef, because I'm gonna sue Helena for damages... or something...
叫我"起訴"大廚吧，因為我要起訴海倫娜賠償我的損失…
Are you just -- fine, yeah, go on ahead. Just don't step on the bridge!
你...還好吧，那你快走吧。別待在橋上了!
Helena's instructions were quite clear. Try to cross the bridge, we battle you.
海倫娜指示我們在這裡，阻擊所有試圖過橋的訓練家。
When we've healed up, you'll be sorry for crossing us--er, the bridge.

She knows what she's doing... right?
她知道自己在幹什麼…吧？
Sure she does! We get to guard an entire bridge! Speaking of which, depart the bridge at once!
她當然知道！我們要守好這座橋！說到這，你給我趕快下去！
I'm really starting to think we aren't cut out for this.
我覺得我們真不適合幹這個。
Yeah, if she thinks we'll stay out here for another week, I've got a bridge to sell her... did that even make sense?
嗯，要是她要求我們在這裡待幾周，那我到時是不是能把這座橋賣給她...真夠可笑的。
...Let's just go double-check.
...再仔細檢查一下情況吧。
Oh, shut up. Let's just get back to the Pokecenter.
哎呀，別說了。我們趕緊回精靈中心吧。
Ehehe, the water is so muddy!

I get why Magikarp and Feebas use Splash a lot. It's fun to see all the water fly everywhere!
我知道為什麼鯉魚王和醜醜魚這麼喜歡用水濺躍了，因為濺起水花真的很好玩！
I hear a Meowth makes you 33% luckier -- so now I'm guaranteed to win!
聽說喵喵會給我帶來三分之一的幸運，所以現在我肯定能贏！
Was that 33% increased luck or 33% more lucky? Maybe it isn't linear...?
是增加了三分之一的幸運還是變得更幸運三分之一了呢？所以到底是怎麼算的...
Heads you win, tails I lose, huh...?
正面你贏，反面我輸...誒？哪裡不對？
My shoes...even my socks are soaked.
我的鞋...連襪子都溼了。

Huff...huff...

Yezera never gave up, so neither will I!
葉澤拉從未放棄過，所以我也不能放棄！
No thanks.
算了吧
Sure.

They say that he can hatch any Dragon Egg. I seek him to hatch a few of the eggs I have collected myself.
據說他可以孵化所有的龍蛋，我也想找他幫忙孵化一些我的收藏。
I bought this outfit and everything. It would feel quite strange were I to remain Dragon-less...
畢竟我都已買好了這身衣服，結果還沒有龍精靈，也太尷尬了……
My peaceful stroll through the park is ruined by all this racket!

I'm not sure how I did it, but my bike is up there, and I am down here.
我也不清楚發生了什麼，只知道我的自行車在那上面，而我卻站在這裡。
It's all a blur. I was in the moment. A flow state.
當一切發生時，我便完全沉浸在這種感覺之中，進入了一種忘我的境界。
It was magnificent.
這一定是什麼啟示！
But now I am down here, and my bike is up there.
所以現在我還在這裡，我的自行車也還在上面。
I miss my bike.
我的車！
I can't decide where I want to battle.
我不知道該走哪條路了。
The Trainers to the east are easier.
東邊的訓練家比較簡單。
But if I don't go west now, I'll have to go counter-clockwise around Mt. Kilna.
但是西邊是近路，不需要繞基爾納山逆時針走一圈。

You might not be a dragon by type, but you may be a dragon by heart!

Hey, Trainer. I've got an offer you might want.
嘿，訓練家，有興趣跟我做一筆買賣嗎？
My Pokemon breeding company has been producing too many Eevees.
最近我的飼育屋裡降生了太多的小伊布。
They're a popular request, but market fluctuations left us with a bit too much excess.
雖說這種精靈一直很受歡迎，但最近的市場新規弄得很麻煩。
Contractually, I'm not allowed to give them away, but trading? A loophole covers me there.
我們之前的渠道基本都被鎖死了，現在只有精靈交換這一種方法，還有些許空子可以鑽（在箱子裡選擇精靈）。
I'll trade you for any Normal-type Pokemon.
你可以用任意一隻一般系的精靈來交換它。
And pass up on a good deal like this? Where else can you get an Eevee this easy?
不換？真的假的？別的地方能這麼容易弄到伊布？
Well, I'm not really going anywhere till I get rid of this Eevee.
行，在處理掉這隻伊布之前，我哪兒都不會去。
Pleasure doing business with you.
很高興與你交易。
Take care of the little guy, ya hear?
好好照顧這個小傢伙，沒問題吧？
How's the little guy treating you?
那個小傢伙現在怎麼樣？
If you're looking for a stone for it, you might be able to find one if you go off the beaten path a bit.
你如果在找進化石的話，可以去附近的小路上看看。
Who knows? Just a hunch.
指不定哪兒就會有別人不小心掉的。
Ohoho, so you've beat everyone in the club have you?
哦吼吼，所以說...你已經打敗了俱樂部的所有人對吧？
Well, everyone but me.
呃，是除了我以外的所有人。
I used to be quite the battler, but that was a while ago, both me and my Pokemon have retired.
我曾經是位很強的訓練家，不過那是很久以前的事，現在我和我的精靈都退休了。
We don't have enough energy to hike a route to find fights, but we always have enough for a good fight. Never did outgrow battling.
我們已沒有精力四處尋求戰鬥，但熱情卻從未減退。
Will you entertain an old man like me?
你想陪我這個老傢伙過過招嗎？
I look forward to being able to battle another accomplished trainer.

I maybe old, but I'm still got fight in me yet.

Amazing! I haven't felt that enthralled since the Shuppet incident! You've done me a great favor.
在怨影娃娃事件過後，我已經很久沒這樣心潮澎湃過了，你幹得不錯，年輕人！
More than you know. Much more than you know.
這讓我重燃了青春的熱血。
My my, what a great fight that was. You gave me quite a battle.
呦吼吼，那場戰鬥真是太棒了，真讓人神清氣爽啊！
You've taught me that I might just have my hardest battles ahead of me yet!
後生可畏，後生可畏啊！不過對於我們這些老傢伙來說，將來還會有更艱難的戰鬥在等著呢！

These beasties ain’t anything special – students want their Pokémon to stay in fighting condition, but exams are hell.
這裡的學生為了通過考試，必須讓這些精靈們保持戰鬥狀態 - 即便它們並沒有什麼特別之處。
That’s where I come in. Wallet a little lighter, mind at ease.
這就是我在做的事情，當然，也是有代價的。
Great. Let’s keep these things fighting fit.
太好了，讓它們保持最佳的戰鬥狀態吧
You down to help me train these?
你願意幫我訓練它們嗎？
You ain’t just any two-bit tourist, are you?
你並不是一個普通的遊客，對吧？
Tell me: you got a rival? Someone that you keep running into at the worst times? Pushes you to your limit?
或者說 - 你有勁敵嗎？就是那種總在最糟糕的時候出現，將你逼到絕境的人？
Oh, I’ve heard that one before. Family drama. Tale as old as time.
嗯，我聽說過這個故事。家庭紛爭，老生常談了。
Best of luck with that, I s’pose.
那就祝你好運吧。
Great.
好的。
Ya don’t have to tell me. Not important.
你不用告訴我細節，不管他是誰，這不重要。
So long as you’ve got someone – you need somebody.
只要有就好 - 這樣就會有動力。
Really? Nobody good enough for ya?
真的？其他人都不配做你的勁敵？
Well, s’pose it don’t matter too much. You’ve done plenty fine without one so far, right?
嗯，倒是也沒什麼所謂，反正你一個人也可以做到這種地步。
Hah!
哈哈！
Nah, kid. I already crossed that bridge, and it’s the kinda road ya don’t walk twice.
算了吧，小傢伙。我已經走過那條路了，絕對不想再走第二次。
'Bout wore me out, too.
那可是很累人的。
You’re good, though, and I’m bein’ genuine.
不過，有一說一，你真的很強。
Ya beat my friend and now ya beat me.
你之前打敗了我的朋友，現在又打敗了我。
Ain’t half-bad. I ain’t paid to gab, though.
好吧 - 可惜沒時間閒聊了。
Gotta get movin’ – Trubbish needs training, and the <imp>sewers 'neath LuxTech</imp> are the place to be for it.
我得繼續訓練破破袋了，<imp>光華市的下水道</imp>很適合它。
Here ya go, though, for your troubles.
這是給你的，麻煩你了。
See ya 'round. And, hey, you run into my friend again, beat the tar outta her, alright?
回頭再見，哦對了，如果你再遇到我那個朋友的話，就狠狠地揍她一頓，好嗎？
Hey-yo!
嘿 - 呀！
Hope you still remember me. I was the good-lookin' trainer camping out in front of the gym in Casaba Villa.
你還記得我嗎，我是凡雅。之前在甜瓜道館門口的訓練家。
Well now I'm here, and the story's the same. Honing my skills with a team custom-built for the gym leader here.
現在我也來這邊了，當然還是同樣的事，訓練一支專門為館主準備的隊伍。
Though I'm looking forward to it, it'll also be a little bitter-sweet having to take out a fellow enby.
雖然我很期待這次挑戰，但要打敗一個曾經的同窗，絕對不是一件簡單的事情。
Anyways, I'll be here for now, ready and willing to battle you as much as you want!
總之，我會在這裡待一段時間，只要你想，隨時可以開始訓練！
Wanna go?
開一局？
Understood.
明白明白。
I'll be here until you wish to battle.
我會在這裡等你回來。
Glorious combat!
為了榮耀！
Ouch. That one hurts. Gotta get used to the pain, though, or else I won't stand a chance against Eko!
誒喲，好疼啊！不行，我得習慣疼痛，不然怎麼可能打贏艾克！
A good fight, really got the blood flowin'.
真是熱血沸騰的一戰！
Return later for a rematch.
先休息一下，回頭再打。
I can tell from the scorch marks that you went up against Eko, and from the gym badge...that you won!
從這些痕跡可以看出...你已經跟艾克打過了，並且你拿到了道館的徽章！
That means the time for procrastinating is over, and the time for courage is nigh. Allons-y!
看樣子不能再拖延下去了，是時候鼓起勇氣面對他了。勢必達成！
No.
等下
Yes.
行
No
不換
Yes
換
Not right now.
現在先算了
What exactly do you need?
你到底需要什麼
Sure thing.
行吧
My brother.
我哥
Someone.
的確
You offering?
要不你來？
Maybe later.
稍等一下
Sure, let's go.
開就開
[Map57]
I get to go home... doesn’t even seem real yet.
我要回家了…這簡直太不真實了。
I guess I’m still the gym leader.
我覺得我還是道館館主。
Gonna need to find someone else to take the job, eventually. But for now I get to go home.
到頭來還是需要找其他人來接替這份工作...管他的，我終於可以回家了！
And maybe I’m gonna have a talk with Andris and the rest of them, about what happened.
也許我該和安德里斯他們好好談談發生了什麼。
And about sticking me in a cave for a few years to deal with the consequences...
還有把我關在山洞裡處理了幾年爛攤子的事…
The Aether Foundation, from Alola, is looking to establish a branch in Makya.
來自阿羅拉的以太基金會正計劃在馬凱亞設立分部。
I'm here to do some location research for that, but I also have a secret project of my own.
我來這裡是為了做選址調研，不過我還有個祕密項目。
To help me along, think you'd like to buy this Alolan Meowth?
為了幫我一把，你想買下這隻阿羅拉喵喵嗎？
For a low, low price of $5000, you could help me along.
只需5000美元的低價，你就能幫我大忙。
Sure, I'm certain another Alolan Meowth will just stumble into your hands.
當然，我相信另一隻阿羅拉喵喵會自己跑到你手裡的。
Why thank you, stranger. Rest well knowing that you are a patron of science.
太感謝了，陌生人。安心休息吧，你可是科學的贊助者。
\PN hands over $5000 in exchange.
\PN遞出了5000美元作為交換。
Well, not gonna waste any more time here. I've got science to do.
好了，不在這兒浪費時間了。我還有科學要搞。
Hm? Pay? With what cash?
嗯？付錢？用什麼現金？
Oh, sorry about the wait, I was just preparing to go back on duty.
哦，不好意思久等了，我正準備回去值班呢。
I've been investigating a group of thieves.
我在調查一個偷進化石的盜賊團伙。
They're hiding out in the \c[2]Kilna Turf\c[0], the route to the east of town.
聽說他們逃到鎮子東邊的\c[2]基爾納草徑\c[0]了。
The tall grass makes a good hiding place for criminals and their stolen goods.
那些高高的草叢為罪犯和贓物提供了絕佳的藏身之處。
If you decide to go over there, you could nab yourself some items which have been forgotten by their owners and those thieves.
也正因為如此，那邊總會有一些實力一般的訓練家，
No need to worry--the trainers there aren't too strong.
抱著碰運氣的態度，在草叢裡尋找小偷遺留的物品。
Have a good one!
不多說了，再見！
No thanks.
不了，謝謝。
Sure, I'll pay.
當然，我付。
[Map58]
[Map59]
A Bicycle. It looks slightly dinged up.
一輛看起來有些舊的自行車。
Young master, before you head out!
少主，稍等一下！
I should have told you this while we were sailing-- your family owns an unused Estate here in Makya.
我路上忘了告訴您 - 您名下有一處在馬凱亞的莊園。
Since you're taking on the Makyan Gym Challenge, I took the initiative to renovate the grounds for our use.
由於之前一直處於棄置狀態，所以我在聽說您要來這邊進行道館挑戰之後，便自作主張將其修繕了一番。
I've set up a system that sends the Pokemon you store in your PC to this <imp>PokÉstate</imp>.
這是我所寫的一個程序系統，您可以將存儲在電腦中的精靈送到這座<imp>莊園</imp>裡休憩。
I'll take care of them there while you are busy with your journey.
當您忙於旅途時，我會在那裡好好照看它們。
I love Pokemon variety, so I've prepared lots of <imp>EXP Candy</imp> to give you as your collection grows.
隨著莊園裡的精靈種類越來越多，我也可以給您提供一些<imp>經驗糖果</imp>，幫助您完成這次的旅程。
Once you've earned some, I'll send them to you through the PC.
我會將它們寄存在電腦中，您可以隨時取用。
Would you like to view the PokÉstate? I can take us over there for a visit.
現在要去莊園看看嗎？
Understood, I'll wait for you on the boat in the mean time.
是，我會在這裡隨時恭候。
If you want to visit the PokÉstate, send me a ping at any PC.
如果您想要前往莊園，只需要用電腦發消息給我就好。
I'll take you there immediately.
我會立即帶您前往那裡。
Understood, I'll sail us over.
是，我這就帶您前往。
I bought these orbs to spice up my juggling act.
我本來是為了給雜技表演增加節目效果才買的這些寶珠。
Ended up burning down a tent, poisoning a clown, and freezing my brother.
然後就燒掉了一頂帳篷，毒暈了一個小丑，凍住了一個哥們兒。
I'm out of a job. Take pity, and buy 'em off me?
所以我就光榮地失業了，能不能把這些東西買下來，救濟救濟我呢？
I'm asking $5,000 for the three of them. Package deal.
一共$5,000怎麼樣？
I really dropped the ball on this.
這下徹底完蛋了。
My gratitude is immense!
感激不盡！
\PN hands over $5,000 in exchange.
\PN將$5,000交給對方。
Time to travel the countryside to find where they might need a man of my talents.
是時候去鄉下轉轉了，看看有哪裡需要我這種人才。
You're broke, just like me! Come back when you can help.
同是天涯淪落人啊！等你有錢的時候再來吧。
G'day mate. Reckon its a fine day for fishin', yeah?
嘿，今天這天氣很適合釣魚啊！
Been fishing meself a storm lately, gotta ton of new Pokemon to show off.
最近我通過這種運動，抓到了不少新精靈。
Been rough with this one little bugga though, a Carvanha. Ain't getting along with the others.
不過有個小傢伙讓我很頭疼，有隻利牙魚跟其他精靈合不來。
Tell ya what, been looking to get into Bug-type collecting for a while now.
這麼說吧，我最近在找蟲屬性的精靈。
Might as well get started on it, if ya got one spare I'll trade ya for it.
如果你有多餘的蟲系精靈，我就用那隻利牙魚跟你交換（在箱子裡選擇精靈）。
No worries, mate. I'll be 'ere for a good while if ya change your mind.
不要緊，夥計，你要改主意了就再來找我吧。
All good, mate. Show me when ya got one.
好的，夥計，你抓到之後再來找我吧。
Right on.
好極了。
Reckon I could get a few more in a couple days.
這幾天應該還能再弄幾隻。
Make a real sick collection of Bug-types, ya?
這樣就有超級炫酷的蟲系大隊了！
Good on ya for catching this 'mon, its a real beauty.
我很喜歡這隻精靈，它真是漂亮極了。
Hey, you!
嘿，你！
Yeah, you, get over here!
對，就是你，過來！
I picked up this bike in Novo Town. The people up there are crazy for bikes, so it was easy to find one.
我之前在望新鎮撿了輛自行車，那裡的人幾乎人手一輛，所以滿大街都是。
For the same reason, though, everyone already got one, so I wasn't able to sell.
但也正因如此，根本沒有出手的空間。
Seems like the whole job was a bust, so just take it.
這次“撿拾”也太失敗了，乾脆給你算了。
You never saw me, and I didn't cause you any problems. Peace.
你從來沒見過我，我也不認識你，拜拜。
The berry plant is growing.
樹果還在生長中。
It looks excited to take on the next shipment!
它看起來很興奮，準備迎接下一批貨物!
North: Shipping Lane
北：揚帆路
These docks may look small, but they're important.
這個碼頭看起來規模不大，但重要性絕對夠高。
Every week a shipment comes of groceries and other necessities for Novo Town.
要維持大城市的燈紅酒綠，就必須得穩定各地的物資支援。
They get some stuff from the big city, but can't rely on it for everything.
每週都會有一批食物和生活必需品，在這裡裝貨，運往望新鎮。
Mt. Kilna makes it harder to get stuff in between, even with Gigalith's Guts cutting through it.
即便怪巖腸道貫穿了基爾納山，也因為受到地形的限制，無法進行大規模的陸路運輸。
Not right now.
現在不用
Sure.
可以
No
不要
Yes
要了
[Map60]
I didn’t think there’d be so many people… and you know they’re watching me.
我沒想到有這麼多人...你也看到了他們一直在盯著我。
I hate it out here…
我討厭這種感覺……
Oh!
啊！
I didn’t think – I mean, I’m sorry, I – wait.
我...我沒想到...不對...我...抱歉，我...等等！
You’re a trainer. I was given these to train by – by my friend, so… fight me?
你是個訓練家。這是...幫我朋友訓練的...所以...我們打一場吧？
W-well, I – no, I’m a trainer. Face me.
好...好吧...我...不對，我也是個訓練家，所以...面對我吧。
I – I’m not going to let you through until you do.
不然我...我不會讓你過去的。
Oh, no, I’m so sorry.
哦，不是，我...抱歉。
Artemisia isn’t – she flies me places.
蒿蒿不是...她帶我飛了很多地方。
She doesn’t fight unless I – I’m sorry. I’m talking your ear off.
她不戰鬥，除非...我...抱歉，我不該說這麼多。
OK. Good.
好，很好！
I mean, thanks.
我的意思是說...謝謝。
Oh. Well, that wasn’t – I didn’t mind that.
嗯，很好，這...我是說...我不介意。
You’re not… nevermind.
你...應該不是...算了。
Maybe we’ll meet again – but, uh, I’m – thank you.
或許我們會再見的...但是...我...謝謝。
The berry plant is growing.
樹果還在生長中。
I'm bored of searching for the <imp>Dragon Den</imp> around here.
我受夠了，這裡哪有<imp>龍穴</imp>。
Let's battle, instead!
不管了，來跟我打一架吧！
Welp, looks like we're not close to an even match.
唉，看來我們實力差距很大。
You just make sure to keep on truckin' with that team of yours!
你一定要取得更高的成就！
If only I had that Dragon-type...
如果我有那隻龍屬性就好了……
Looking forward to seeing how you grow!
很期待你將來能達到的高度！
North: Novo Town
北：望新鎮
South: Feebas' Fin
南：魚鰭港
A sharpened mind is the key to victory. Has yours been whetted?
敏銳清晰的頭腦是取勝的關鍵，我會讓你好好見識一下的。
Yours is a razor's edge. I must hone my own.
你的腦子比我的更好使，必須加緊磨練自己了。
Outsmarted and outmatched...for now.
被以智取的方式完勝...不過這只是暫時的。
Hey, give me some practice, won't'cha? I'm gonna need it to become one of Eko's gym trainers!
你好，能幫我訓練訓練嗎？我還需要積累更多的實戰經驗，才能成為艾克的道館訓練家！
Ouch! Maybe I need to go back and study some more. I don't even have a Poison-type yet!
哎喲！感覺還得繼續學習，我連只毒屬性精靈都沒有！
See? I didn't do too bad! I could totally work for them!
看見沒？我的水平還不錯！我絕對可以勝任這份工作!
You got some hot moves! Remind me to introduce you to Lainie -- she'd love ya!
你的那些技能很給力啊！我覺得應該把你介紹給蘭妮 - 我想她會喜歡你的！
Hey, good to see you again!
嘿，很高興再次見到你！
I just created this invention, and I need testers.
我這裡又有新的發明，現在需要測試人員。
Anyways, I'm traveling up north to the big city for the Battle Festival!
對了，我正打算去北邊的大城市，參加\c[2]戰鬥節慶典\c[0]！
Cross the river into <imp>Prizca</imp>, the big city, and I'll be there to give you a 4th and final invention.
過河到<imp>宏禮市</imp>，那座大城市，我會在那兒給你第四個也是最後一個發明。
See ya!
回頭見！
The door is locked with an old rusty padlock.
這扇門上鎖了一把生鏽的鎖頭。
You press against the door, and the padlock snaps in half!
你稍微用力一推，它就分崩離析了！
Maybe if I turn like this he'll catch my good side.
如果我轉一下身，他或許能捕捉到更好的畫面？
Take a hike, we have a portrait to finish!
一邊待著去，沒看到我們正忙著畫肖像嗎!
I'm searchin' for that bolt of lightning to inspire me. Hit me with it!
我正在尋找那突然的靈光一閃，不知道你能不能給我帶來靈感！
Ah, I just found the perfect riff! I need to have Lainie listen to this! She'd love it!
我找到完美的旋律了！我要趕快去彈給蘭妮聽聽，她一定會喜歡的！
Damn! I was feelin' it for a second there, but then it just fell apart.
淦！我剛找到一丟丟靈感，結果一下子又全沒了！
Serves me right for composing during battle.
這就是在戰鬥中創作的壞處。
It looks like it's taking a needed rest on the bench.
它看起來需要多休息休息。
Excuse me, I'm posing here.
抱歉，我們正在畫肖像！
Don't interfere with the artistic process!
不要干擾藝術創作！
I somehow managed to paint you into the portrait...
不知道為啥就把你畫進去了…
It's been a rocky enough job as it is.
難啊...
A splash of brown, then some red...Gotta get the colours on this perfect!
先是棕色打底，然後紅色點綴…得把這畫的顏色完美地呈現出來!
This job's been a rocky one even without your interference.
就算你沒有打擾到我們，想要完成這幅畫的難度也很大。
You ready? Can we – can we skip the talking and just fight?
 你準備好了嗎？我們——能不能別廢話，直接開打?
No.
不打
A Togekiss?
用波克基斯？
Let's go.
來吧
[Map61]
Ello, landlubber, welcome to the Fin.
你好，旱鴨子，歡迎來到魚鰭港。
You aimin' your sights at the rest of Makya?
你不會還打算去馬凱亞的其他地方吧？
I were you, I'd take care not to end up like them wrecked boats out west o' 'ere.
如果我是你，就會保持謹慎，別落得西邊的那些破船一樣的下場。
Damn rich folk and their careless sailin'...
那些腦殘的有錢人連船都不愛惜...
[Map62]
Heal Bell would be so nice to have for this gym.
如果帶一個治癒鈴聲就好了。
I did a mistake letting my Skitty forget it.
我竟然犯這種錯誤。
I'll have to visit the Move Maniac so my Skitty can <imp>relearn</imp> Heal Bell.
我得去找技能教學狂，讓我的向尾喵<imp>重新學會</imp>這招了。
He's hanging in the Novo PokeCenter.... and in practically every other PokeCenter, somehow.
望新的精靈中心應該有吧...畢竟在每個精靈中心都能見到他們。
At the northernmost part of the Shipping Lane there is a house, and inside of that house a cave, and in that cave an Avatar!
在揚帆路最北端有一座房子，房子裡面有一個山洞，山洞裡有一個化身！
Destroy it!
消滅它！
I’ve been waiting years to find a trainer good enough to eradicate it, and you’re the one!
我已經等待多年了，等待一個足夠強大的訓練家，而你就是那個人！
This key will get you inside, and then just, well, do what I would do!
這是那裡的鑰匙，然後，照我說的做!
Oh, and be a dear and don’t ask anymore questions. Good luck!
啊，多的別再問了，祝你凱旋！
It waits in the suspicious house in the Shipping Lane! Destroy it, and rid me of the damnable thing for good!
它就在揚帆路那棟可疑的房子裡！徹底解決那個該死的東西，讓我脫離苦海吧！
Oh? Have you sent the avatar back from whence it came?! Excellent! Your talents are second-to-none!
哦？你已經把那個化身送到它該去的地方了？好！真是讓人放心的實力！
What, do you miss the lick of flames and bite of acid? Shall we duel once more?
什麼，你懷念火焰的舔舐和酸液的咬噬了？ 那就讓我們再決鬥一場吧！
Congratulations on reaching me!
恭喜你來到我的面前！
And congratulations to all your Pokémon! Especially the ones that are on fire!
也同樣恭喜你所有的精靈！尤其恭喜那些渾身冒火的！
Show us what you’re made of and push through that pain! Just a little longer now!
現在，展示你的實力，堅持下去！我覺得你應該知道該怎麼做。
Are you ready for the grand finale?
準備好觀看壓軸大戲了嗎？
Go on, then! Take a minute! Get your Pokémon some antidotes, or a fire extinguisher!
當然可以！給足你時間！順便準備好解毒劑和滅火器！
Very well, challenger! I present to you the fullest onslaught I can muster!
很好，挑戰者，我將向你展示我最猛烈的攻擊！
Every other gym leader is a coward, but not I!
其他道館館主都是膽小鬼，但我不是！
I know that there is only way to test someone: Over! Whelming! PAIN!
我知道考驗一個人的方法只有一種：極度的痛苦!
Now overcome it, or fall!
現在要麼克服它，要麼萬劫不復！
Lovely! Make no mistake: my panoply of agony takes no half measures.
太好了！另外：我可不會手下留情。
I’ll test you with fire and acid, claw and fang!
我會用火焰、酸液、利爪以及尖牙來考驗你！
Unyielding! Devastating! Indefatigable!
不屈不撓！勢不可擋！
Let me tend to the Pokémon while you bask in your victory.
現在你盡請沉浸在勝利的喜悅中吧，由我來暫時照顧你的精靈。
Not to mention: the Perseverance Badge!
這是你的，毅力徽章！
If you can overcome my gym in such blazing style, I can surely expect great things from you.
如果你能以更熾烈的風格戰勝我，我肯定可以對你寄予厚望。
Perhaps... there is something we absolutely must talk about!
或許…有些事情我們可以...不對，是絕對，必須談談！
I’ve got a mission for you, challenger! Something worthy of your skill, I promise.
我有一個任務要給你，這絕對是配得上你本事的委託。
Good! Good! Never let that fire within you go out!
很好！很好！永遠不要讓你內心的那團火熄滅!
Your victory was delightfully explosive!
你的勝利真是令人欣喜若狂！
I could use more challengers like you!
真希望能有更多你這樣的挑戰者！
Wow! I’m feeling the burn – how about you?
哦，我感覺到灼燒感了 - 你呢，情況怎樣？
I’ll get your Pokémon healed.
我會治療你的精靈。
That for them, and this for you: the Perseverance Badge!
這是給它們的，也是給你的：毅力徽章！
I yearn for the day I might challenge you again! Either here, or in the Championship!
希望有一天能再次考驗你！不管是在這裡，還是在聯盟大賽上!
So long!
再會！
I thought this gym would be a cinch.
我本以為這個道館會很簡單。
A whole team of fish couldn't possibly lose to a Fire- type gym!
畢竟我的魚魚隊伍是不可能輸給火系道館的！
I totally forgot that Poison is strong against Water.
但我忘了現在毒克水！
This is not a lab! It is a gym! In labs we have safety precautions. Here, unsafe conditions are the goal!
這裡不是實驗室！這是個道館！在實驗室裡我們得遵守安全準則，但在這裡，不安全就是我們的準則!
Oh-ho? So you want safe passage? Very well. You've earned the shortcut.
哦？你想安全通過？好吧，你贏得了使用捷徑的權力。
The wild reaches of Makya won't have safety guidelines. If you can endure this, you can endure them.
馬凱亞的野外可沒有安全準則可循。只要你能忍受這裡的考驗，就能在外界生存下去。
Bruh... this waiting room doesn't have any places to sit down.
唉...這個等候廳裡連個座位都沒有。
No pain, no gain? Must be what Eko's thinking.
估計這就是艾克的主意，讓我們在這裡體會痛苦。
White text flies by on a dark purple background.
白色的文字在紫色的屏幕上快速滾動著。
Sorry for blocking the way, but I'm desperately dehydrated.
抱歉，我擋了你的路，但我已經有些脫水了。
You have a <imp>Fresh Water</imp>! I'll be taking that...
你有一瓶<imp>美味之水</imp>！我想要的就是這個...
The man takes a Fresh Water from your bag.
他以迅雷不及掩耳之勢，從你的包裡拿走了一瓶美味之水。
Ahhhh.... that helps a lot. Thanks.
啊...得救了，萬分感謝。
Consider the lockdown over.
我這就讓開這條路。
The scientists keep offering me liquids in beakers, but I've had too many close calls with caustic chemicals to just trust 'em on the contents.
這裡的科學家們只用燒杯提供給我一些奇奇怪怪的液體喝，但我見過他們做實驗的樣子，實在是不敢下口。
I can't leave my post, so blocking the gym entrance is my only leverage.
但我又不能隨便離開崗位，所以只能用這種方法尋求生命之源。
I'm plopping down here until a challenger like yourself grabs me a <imp>Fresh Water</imp>.
我只能等在這裡，期盼著那些...訓練家帶來的<imp>美味之水</imp>。
There are <imp>vending machines</imp> in all PokéCenters and Ranger Stations.
所有精靈中心和義軍站都有<imp>自動售貨機</imp>。
Yo, champ in the making!
嘿，未來的冠軍！
Eko is the gym leader here, and they love pain in all its forms.
這個道館的館主是艾克，他是個熱愛各種形式痛苦的訓練家，
Therefore they picked Fire and Poison as their specialties.
所以他選擇了火系和毒系，作為這個道館的配置。
Ground-types are rather strong in this gym. Psychic-types and Rock-types are none too shabby either.
所以地面系精靈的優勢最大，超能系和岩石系也很不錯。
The final piece to this gym's puzzle are the teleporters.
這個道館裡面有一些傳送門。
See those blue pads? The ones the trainers are protecting will teleport you past the maze.
看到那些藍色的地磚了嗎？踩到它就會將你傳送出來。
If you don't unlock them, you'll find yourself walking a harsh path!
如果能夠解鎖這些傳送門，會對你的挑戰提供很多幫助。
'Grats on beating the gym!
恭喜你通過了道館挑戰！
You pushed through the pain just fine.
你成功剋制了自己的痛苦。
A 3-D model displays the the chemical makeup of Makyan Tangela venom.
一個展示了馬凱亞蔓藤怪毒液化學成分的3D模型。
I hope you won't find this cruel. The suffering I'm about to inflict is strictly necessary.
我希望你不會覺得這殘忍，因為這些是必須承受之痛。
...Noted. Please avail yourself of this teleporter. Taking the long way may subject any afflicted Pokemon to undue injury.
...好的，你可以使用傳送門了。繞遠路會對受傷的精靈造成持續的二次傷害。
Thank you for your participation. Step carefully, now! Wouldn't want any lingering side effects... heh.
感謝您的參與，但現在請小心行事，只要你不想留下後遺症...呵呵。
Our glorious Champion! Good evening!
晚上好，我們的冠軍！
Or morning! I’m not in the business of keeping count of the hours. That’s for the interns!
還是說早上好？無所謂，我不負責計時工作，那是實習生該乾的事！
Now, why are you here? Hoping for a rematch? Looking to learn more about me?
那你來這裡做什麼？希望再來一場重賽？還是說想更多的瞭解我？
Sorry! I’m busy! Drastically, obscenely busy! There is much work to be done, and I absolutely cannot spoil what it might be!
但是很抱歉，我現在很忙！忙得要命，忙得頭疼！我現在有太多的工作需要做了！
Goodbye, \PN. We’ve already had our last battle.

Wow! Well done! That must have been nervewracking.
好好好！這可真不容易。
I wonder why those two Pokemon came here in the first place.
不過問題是那兩隻精靈為什麼會出現在這種地方？
Aren't Absol drawn to areas with upcoming disasters?
阿勃梭魯不是隻有在通知災難時才會現身嗎？
Yikes. I hope they predicted wrong.
哎呀。我希望它們預測錯了。
Anyways, thanks for all the help.
不管怎樣，謝謝你的幫助。
I'm gonna get out of this place, it's got to be packed with bad vibes.
我得趕緊離開這個地方，以免真的發生什麼不好的事。
Oh, man, perfect timing!
誒喲，來得正是時候!
I came up here to investigate a noise complaint.
我是在接到投訴之後，來這裡檢查噪音來源的工作人員。
Turns out there's this freaking ghost spirit thing running around!
發現有一個該死的幽靈在到處亂跑！
Then out of nowhere an Absol busts into the room and they start staring each other down!
然後有隻來歷不明的阿勃梭魯突然闖進了這個房間，它們就這樣互相盯著對方看！
I'm too afraid to get close, and I'm too afraid to leave them alone.
我不敢靠近，也不敢離開。
Could you, ya know, deal with it?
你...你能處理一下嗎?
Well don't look at me, I left my Pokemon at home!
別看我，我把精靈留在家裡了！
Absol is silently staring at the spirit.
阿勃梭魯默默地盯著對方。
It has a tense expression, but it's shaking slightly.
它的表情很緊張，身體在微微顫抖。
The Absol looks at you, expression blank, but trembling.
阿勃梭魯看著你，神色茫然、顫抖不已。
If you tried to catch it, it probably wouldn't put up a fight.
或許這正是抓住它的好機會。
You'll leave the Pokemon here for now.
你暫時將精靈留在這裡。
You bring out a Pokéball from your bag while petting the Absol on its head.
你從包裡拿出一個精靈球，同時撫摸著阿勃梭魯的頭。
You swear you see the faintest smile form on it before it enters the ball.
在它進球之前，你看到它嘴邊浮現出一絲微不可見的弧度。
You don't have a Pokeball to give it.
你沒有精靈球可以裝它。
No
不抓
Yes
抓了

I'm participating in the current archival project at the Digsite Ruins.
我正在參與一項遺址發掘項目。
Those ginormous statues won't document themselves, so we have to!
那些巨型雕像缺少文字記錄，所以只能靠我們猜著寫！
I wrote a whole paper on the special significance of where each Regi was placed in the main chamber.
我上一篇論文全部篇幅都在介紹每位巨人都代表著什麼意義。
I spy a MasterDex!
你有大師圖鑑！
Yours truly submitted lots of information for that project.
看樣子你收集了很多信息。
Collecting information on this here Boldore was especially difficult.
對於擁有一隻地幔巖的我來說，想要收集這些並不容易。
She just loved phasing my carefully collected notes out of existence!
她有時候會把我的文件弄壞！

I always thought of myself as quite dedicated, but my roommate blows me out of the water.
我一直認為自己是死忠粉，但我的室友讓我開了個大眼。
I've gotta scrounge up some more Eevee Tickets and visit that pub in Prizca East.
我還得再搞幾張伊布票，然後去東宏禮市的酒吧。
Then, I'll be able to call myself a true fan!
這樣就能算是合格的死忠粉了吧！

I gained a lot of weight living on my own, with no parents to stop me from binging ice cream.
一個人生活的時候，就沒有父母來阻止我狂炫冰淇淋了，所以體重增加了很多。
I started swimming to try and get in shape. I even went ocean swimming!
為了保持身材，我開始游泳，從池塘到河流，再到大海！
Soon after, though, this accursed Pokemon started following me around! It won't leave me alone!
然後就被這隻可惡的精靈盯上了，一直糾纏不休！
All it does is poke my stomach over and over while smirking! It makes me feel really self conscious.
它總是一邊傻笑一邊戳我肚子！這讓我感到很不自在。
I want a NICE Pokemon! One that I can go for runs with and one that doesn't make me feel awful all the the time!
我想要一隻友善的精靈！一個可以和我一起運動，不會讓我一直感到難受的精靈!
A uh... Fighting-type! A noble Fighting-type! Perfect for an exercise buddy.
沒錯…格鬥系！高貴的格鬥系！完美的運動搭檔。
Please, if you have one, I will trade you for it.
如果你有，我會用它來和你交換（在箱子裡選擇精靈）。
Ohhh.. What am I to do?
哦...我該怎麼辦？
Please don't bother me, it makes the pain worse.
請不要拿我開玩笑，這隻會讓我更痛苦。
Thank you, you've done me a huge favor.
謝謝你，你幫了我一個大忙。
Please, take it somewhere it can be as mean as it wants. Just not to me.
把它帶去什麼鬼地方都行，只要不是在我身邊就好。
Thank you friend. I feel better now.

Your Pokemon is helping me keep in shape.

I was attacked by an avatar a few weeks ago.
一個月前我被化身攻擊了。
You'd think that I'd know how to battle since my parents were Chasm, but no.
雖說我的父母都是裂隙隊成員，但我對對戰一竅不通。
I was caught with my pants down.
所以就只能屁滾尿流地逃走了。
I only met my roommate recently.
我最近才認識我的室友。
Apparently both of her parents... Were in Team Chasm?
聽說她的父母都是...裂隙隊成員？
I guess I shouldn't judge. I hear some professors still hold a grudge, though.
我知道不應該隨意評判這些，不過我聽說有些博士仍懷恨在心。
Their fight with Team Chasm ended like a decade ago, right? Why keep the bad blood?
一方面，他們和裂隙隊的鬥爭十年前就已經結束了，為什麼還要彼此仇視呢？
But on the other hand, if somebody sicced a Salamence on my school, I'd be pissed.
但從另一方面來說，如果有人派一隻暴飛龍攻擊我們的學校，我也會很生氣。
[Map73]
I've been working with the local Pokemon Center in order to improve the healing stations.
為了改善治療裝置，我一直在與當地的精靈中心合作。
The college gave me a decent grant in order to do so. I'm trying to make the thing more energy efficient.
學院也給了我一筆可觀的補貼，支持我研究如何讓這機器更加節能。
Hopefully this research will let us set up centers in even more places.

你是什麼人？
Get the hell out of my room!
滾出我的房間！
Give me a second to compose myself. I'd like to give an apology if you talk to me later.
讓我稍微冷靜一下。你嚇了我一大跳。
Ok. Sorry. I'm calmer now. That was really rude of me to do that.
差不多了，抱歉。我現在冷靜多了。我那樣做真是太無禮了。
Just get out of here! Leave, ok?
快離開這裡吧，夥計！離開，好嗎？
Hey, I was rude earlier. I was just in the moment and I don't like distractions.
確實，我不該大吼大叫，只是...我不喜歡被打擾。
Doesn't excuse my behavior though.
即便如此...
Sorry.
抱歉了。
Here, take this. As a token of goodwill. I shouldn't be drinking caffiene anyways.
行，這個給你了，算是一份善意，總之我不應該喝咖啡。
I'll be better next time.
下次我的態度會改善吧。
Just leave, ok!
現在可以離開了吧！
Zoé forever! Bence should pack it up and go home!
佐伊萬歲！本斯該收拾行李回家了！
Oh, you've never heard of them?
啊，你沒聽說過他們？
Zoé is the rock-tough Gym Leader of Prizca West, and Bence is a loser weakling trying to take her spot.
佐伊是宏禮市西區的道館館主，而本斯是一個充滿嫉妒心，妄圖取代她位置的可憐弱雞。
You'd think the government would do something, but the Gymnasium Office has cowardly ignored all my emails.
我為此給政府部門寫了好幾封郵件，但道館管理辦公室卻無視了我。
You got the Prizca West badge, that means... you beat Zoe?!
你拿到了西宏禮道館的徽章，也就是…你打敗了佐伊？
You must be some trainer. I've still got a ways to go before I can even approach her level.
你一定是位出色的訓練家。要達到她的水平，我還有很長的路要走。
...tell me you wallopped Bence, too, right?
...你也痛扁了本斯一頓，對吧？
[Map77]
I hope I get to go spelunking for my Paleontology courses.
我希望能去參加古生物學老師組織的洞穴探險活動。
Makya has such grand caves, after all. It'd be a shame to not get to see them.
畢竟馬凱亞有太多壯觀的洞穴，錯過可就太可惜了。
There's one with a bunch of petrified Pokemon. And one where water flows in intricate patterns.
聽說有滿是化石精靈的洞穴，還有水流呈現複雜圖案的洞穴。
And! And... I'm boring you, aren't I.
除此之外還有…你覺得我很煩是嗎？
Unpacking sucks. I wish I didn't have to do it.
搬家真麻煩，我真希望永遠不要有下一次。
I found this while unpacking. I don't know where I got it, and I don't want it.
我在搬家時發現了這個，不知道是從哪裡弄來的。

Many of the species researched here are are hard to find in the wild.
有很多需要研究的物種在野外很難碰到。
Because of this, they offer jobs for trainers to bring in the Pokemon needed for new studies.
因此他們會聘請訓練家，來提供那些不常見的精靈。
The Kadabra is focusing very hard.
這隻勇基拉正在集中精力。
Finding data is one thing, but interpretation is a whole different beast.
查找數據是一回事，分析數據是另一回事。
Interpretation isn't as clear cut as just collecting more data.
分析數據也是很消耗腦力的。
Which is why I've been stuck here doing statistics calculations for hours...
這就是我被統計表困在這裡好幾個小時的原因...
I feel bad for that lady that works in inventory.
我覺得一直管理倉庫的那位女士很可憐。
It's a lot of manual labor, and the space is pretty cramped as well.
工作很繁重，空間又小。
I'm collecting money to buy her an appreciation gift.
我正在湊錢給她買一份感謝禮物。
Could you maybe pitch in?
你能入個股嗎？

You hand over $1000.
你給了他$1000。
Thanks! With this I'll be able to get her something excellent!
謝謝，有了這些錢，我就能給她買些好東西了！
You don't have $1000?
你連$1000都沒有？
I guess you have your own problems.
夥計，我覺得你有大麻煩了。
I've been talking with some of my co-workers about how to handle the gift.
我一直在跟同事們商量，應該選一個什麼禮物。
We decided to surprise her with some high quality Pokemon handling gloves.
最後我們決定給她一個驚喜，買一副高質量的絕緣手套。
That way she can pet her Ampharos without having to worry of getting shocked!
這樣她在撫摸她電龍時就不用擔心被電到了。
A slide is being shown with a graph projecting profits for the next year.
幻燈片上顯示的是下一年的利潤預測圖。
The aesthetic of the slide is somehow bright and boring at the same time.
即無美感又乏味。
I keep falling asleep during board meetings.
我老是在開會的時候睡著。
I tried to learn this one move...it lets Pokemon act even while sleeping.
因此，我試著去學習這個...能讓精靈在睡著後行動的技能。
I forgot that, as a human... I wouldn't be able to learn it.
但是我忘了個很重要的事...我是個人類，我學不會！
So, take this. It's not of any use to me anymore.
所以，把這個拿走吧，我已經用不到了。
Huh? Whuh? Uh?
嗯？嗯！呃...
Oh, hey. Uh. Yeah. Secure the funding.... zzz...
哦...那個...說得對！zzz...
I've been burning the midnight oil on my research assignment for months now.
這幾個月，我一直在熬夜完成自己的研究。
I feel like I'm close, but sleep deprivation is getting to me.
已經快成功了，但長時間的睡眠不足讓我覺得身體很不舒服。
I found myself arriving at work with random items that I don't remember grabbing.
有時候會發現自己帶著一些不記得是什麼時候拿的物品。
Take this TM. I don't remember even owning it, let alone taking it with me.
拿著這個技能機吧，我完全記不起什麼時候拿的了。
I need to get some sleep.
我需要睡一會兒。
Well, once the energy high wears off.
等完成這一點再說吧。
I was invited to work on a research project with my Swadloon.
我和我的寶包繭一起，受邀來這裡參加一項研究。
The scientist who invited me had to run an errand in the middle of it.

He asked me if I could watch his Pokemon for "just a moment".
還請求我暫時照看他的精靈。
That was over two hours ago...
已經兩個多小時了...
Hello. Are you looking to make an appointment to challenge Ms. Helena?

當然也歡迎您參觀二樓的戰鬥實驗室。

Ah, I know that look. You're wondering why I have an umbrella.
啊，我明白你在奇怪什麼。你在想我為什麼在屋裡打傘。
Well, before you get all judgemental on me, know that it's because the lights here are way too bright, and they give me headaches.
作為一個女孩子，只要能擋住那刺眼的燈光，長不長個對我來說已經不重要了。
I'm sure they're bothering you, too.
或許你也在經受光汙染的困擾。
Why don't I give you one of my spares?
要不要給你一把備用的？
I hope that one day the whole world will understand the blessing that is the indoor umbrella.
我希望有一天，大家都能理解室內打傘的好處。
A LuxTech promotional video is playing on loop and muted.
正在循環播放光華的宣傳視頻，當然是靜音狀態。
Keeping inventory here is tough work.
管理倉庫這項工作非常艱鉅。
Trainers and scientists often just take from here without filing the paperwork properly.
訓練家和研究員們來拿東西，經常不打招呼不做報告。
As a result, we often just lose things. Stranger still, sometimes we just GAIN things.
所以經常會出現一些物品突然消失的情況，但最奇怪的是，有時候還會莫名多出一些東西。
Like this TM, which no one's bothered to claim.
比如說這個技能機，根本沒人認領。
Honestly, just take it. Make my job easier.
給你了，讓我的工作輕鬆點吧。
They don't pay me enough to deal with this stuff.
什麼時候給我漲工資啊。
Helena, the gym leader, is one of the executives here.
道館館主海倫娜，就是這裡的負責人。
She's in charge of the logistics and funding for LuxTech's projects.
光華所有項目的後勤和資金都歸她管。
She used to do the same thing for Team Chasm back in the day.
之前她在裂隙隊時，也在做同樣的工作。
Talk about previous work experience. Her resume must have been killer.
說到工作經驗...她的簡歷一定富有殺傷力！
I often wonder how people did anything before computers.
我經常在想，電腦發明之前人們是怎麼工作的。
I mean, just look at this.
我的意思是，類似這個。
*dink*
*叮*
See how easy that was?
你看，多輕鬆！
Aren't computers rad? With enough work, it seems like they can do anything!
電腦真是個好東西，只要用心研究，它幾乎無所不能！
Of course, learning how to make them do what we want is the hard part...
當然，對於新手來說，學會如何用電腦是最難的部分...
Ugh.
啊...
I wanted to interview Helena.
我想採訪海倫娜。
She said we'd have a 15 minute time frame to get a recorded interview.
她說可以給我15分鐘的時間。
Instead she sends us some intern with pre-recorded answers.
然後就派來了一些事先背好答案的實習生。
Very disappointing.
太失望了。
A screensaver is displayed of a Togedemaru lazily rolling around and occasionally bouncing off the boundaries of the screen.

我們在本地網絡上委託一隻多邊獸來幫助整理文件。
Huh, I wonder what it's like being a Porygon.
哈哈，我很好奇當一隻多邊獸會是怎樣的體驗。
I can't even begin to fathom what travelling through the net like that would even feel like.
我甚至無法想象像那樣通過網絡旅行會是什麼感覺。
You could be anywhere, anytime, at will.
你可以隨時隨地自由穿梭，想去哪去哪。
...
。。。
I should clear my browser history.
我應該先清除我的瀏覽器歷史記錄。
We're here on correspondence about LuxTech's sponsorship of the upcoming League Tournament.
我們這次來這裡，打算詢問一些關於光華市對聯盟大會的資助信息。
The employees here must have all gotten some basic media training. Lots of them were comfortable in front of the camera.
可這裡的員工一定都接受過專業訓練，在面對鏡頭的時候非常自然，
Some even gave me free stuff.
甚至還有人送給我一些小禮物。
You should take some of it off me, though, cause my equipment already weighs a ton!
但是這攝像設備太重了，我根本就拿不下這些！
I'll talk with my co-worker once we get home. We can probably stitch together something interesting.
回去之後再跟同事們商量商量，看能不能拼湊出一些有趣的新聞。
They had my Pokemon do a lot of battling the other day. You know, for science.
那天他們為了收集數據，讓我的精靈進行了好幾場戰鬥。
It was a ton of fun, but it was also exhausting.
雖然很有趣，但也很累。
I gotta make sure we don't overdo it.
我總怕不小心弄壞什麼東西。
Hey, are you \PN? Mavis’s child?
哦，你是 \PN？梅維斯的孩子？
I haven’t seen you since you were Munchlax-sized.
上次見你的時候，也就跟小卡比獸差不多大吧。
Oh, excuse me, were you registering for a challenge?
啊，抱歉，你要預約挑戰？
We’re processing all the latecomers trying to get into the Championships, plus logistics for the event itself, so -- actually.
我們正在處理一些關於競技大會參加者的事務，以及相關比賽的後勤工作，所以...現在...
You’re chasing Zain, I presume?
你是在追趕贊恩？
Of course. I lost to him, oh, a week and a half ago?
沒錯，我輸給他了，大概在十天之前？
I understand that rivalry -- and I understand you don’t have a few weeks to spare.
我知道你們的競爭關係，也理解你趕時間的想法。
Just like I don’t have time to wait for a particularly late shipment to arrive.
就像我工作時也沒時間等待那些運送得特別慢的貨物一樣。
Normally I’d praise you for playing your cards close to your chest, but not with me.
如果是平時，我會誇你能隱藏自己的想法，但現在還是開門見山的好。
Don’t play coy -- I’m smarter than that. I’m cutting you a deal, so be smart and listen.
我不傻，知道你們的事情。現在我是要跟你做一筆交易，所以不用做多餘的掩飾了。
...Fine. I don’t believe you, but I’ve been wrong before.
...好吧，說實話我不信，但我以前也判斷錯過。
Rarely.
雖然極少。
In any case, you’re not the patient sort, and if Tamarind is to be believed you have a knack for dangerous errands.
總之，你不像個很有耐心的人，如果塔瑪琳說的沒錯，你應該很擅長執行一些危險任務。
I need a shipment located.
我需要找到一批貨物。
There’s a tunnel we call Gigalith’s Guts to the southwest. It links the Kilna Turf to the County Park.
西南邊有一條我們稱之為怪巖腸道的隧道，它連通了基爾納草徑和國立公園。
You can imagine how convenient that little shortcut is for shipping, and hence why a hypothetical important set of objects would be routed through it.
你應該能想象得到這條路對於貨物運輸來說有多麼便捷，所以有些重要的貨物會通過那裡進行運送。
Those objects are late, and now I’m hearing that the Guts are clogged with avatars.
但那批貨物現在還沒送達，據說是因為怪巖腸道被化身佔領了。
Wh-what? You already have the shipment?
什、什麼？那些貨物就在你手上？
I’m not going to ask why you have this.
好吧，我不會多問的。
You give the shipment to Helena.
你把貨物交給海倫娜。
Well. No matter.
看樣子，既然問題解決了。
Um, I suppose I have to accept the challenge now.
我無論如何都要接受挑戰了。
Let’s capitalize on this inexplicable lack of delays and have a quick battle, yes?
那就趁這個空擋儘快結束，如何？
To be explicit: save me time and get me my shipment, and I’ll save you time and put on my gym leader hat for a challenge.
簡單來講：你如果幫我節省拿到貨物的時間，我就幫你節省道館挑戰的時間。
Despite almost no language expression abilities, Pokemon actually have significantly better language comprehension than humans.
儘管沒有語言表達能力，但很多精靈的語言理解能力，實際上比人類更強。
I've taught my Kadabra here multiple coding languages.
我的勇基拉就學了好幾種編程語言。
He's the perfect "Rubber Ducklett", catching mistakes as soon as I type them!
他就是最完美的“糾錯人”，每次我輸入錯誤他都會立即發現！
Ah, good news? Excellent! Hand over the shipment.
有好消息了？很好，把貨物給我吧。
This sets us a few days ahead of schedule -- well, ahead of the adjusted schedule.
這可以讓我們的計劃在貨物出現問題後，依然能在原定時間內完成。
Regardless, I will uphold my end of this transaction.
放心，我說到做到。
Meet me in my gym when you’re ready. And do try and be prompt.
準備好就來道館找我吧，儘量準時到。
No, I don’t have anything better to do than wait here for someone to get my shipment back from wherever in the caves it ended up.
我沒有別的事情可做？沒辦法，最重要的貨物還在山洞裡呢。
I mean, I have a phone. Ever heard of a video call?
至於其他事務，可以通過電話完成。
LuxTech's main business is in Technical Machines, so naturally we have a ton of programmers and computer scientists.
光華科技的主要業務是器械製造，所以我們有大量的程序員和計算機領域的人才。
However, LuxTech spends a decent amount on research as well, so there's scientists everywhere too.
不過光華在其他研究上也投入了不少資金，所以到處都能看見研究員。
On top of that, we employ former pro-trainers to test our new products.
我們還聘請了一些前職業訓練家，幫助我們對新產品進行測試。
Speaking of which, take this. I was told to give it to Trainers who talked to me.
說到這裡，收下這個吧。上級說如果有訓練家來跟我聊天，就把這個給他。
The diversity here is wonderful.
真是一家多棲發展的企業啊。
No
不給
Yes
給錢
Yeah.
是的
Maybe.
誰知道呢
He isn't relevant.

Wow! We're supposed to be professionals, but your battling prowess made everyone run away.
哇！這裡的大家都算得上專業人士，但是你的實力卻讓我們落荒而逃。
You've beaten everyone, so as promised, a reward.
你戰勝了所有人，所以，這個獎勵是你的了。
Normally we give out Performance Analyzers here, but since you already have one, I'll upgrade it!
我們這裡的獎品是對戰分析儀，但你已經有一臺了，所以我會對它進行升級！
Now, go on and win that championship, hm?
現在，去贏得那個冠軍吧？
With all the work Helena's putting in, she deserves to have a good sport like you as victor.
海倫娜付出了那麼多努力，也該遇到像你這樣強大的訓練家了。
Ah, so you've made it to me. However, it looks like some of my teammember's here remain unchallenged.
啊，你終於來找我了。不過，你還沒有完成我們的挑戰。
Go back and fight them all, then come back to me.
去挑戰大家吧，然後再來找我。
I have no more to offer you, I'm afraid. Your battling data was excellent, so it's a shame.
恐怕我拿不出什麼獎品了，你的戰鬥數據非常優秀，所以很遺憾。
Sketch is an amazing move! We're still trying to find the limits of Smeargle biology.
寫生是一種神奇的技能！我們一直在探索圖圖犬的極限。
Help me find it!
試著幫我找到它吧！
Excellent work! I have all the research I need.
幹得漂亮！我已經得到所需的研究資料了。
Enjoy your day.
祝你今天過的愉快。
I'll need to review this data for a bit, come back later.
我需要檢查一下這些數據，待會再過來吧。
Begin a doubles battle against the Artificial Trainer?
要開始與人工訓練家的雙打對戰嗎？
Strategic Battling Testing Room
策略對戰測試室
One of the scientists here gave me a batch of weird rocks, and told me to give some to my Mudsdale.
有個研究員給了我一批奇怪的石頭，她讓我把其中一部分給我的重泥挽馬帶上。
I now understand why she said "some" instead of "all".
我現在明白她為什麼說的是“一部分”而不是“全部”了，我的精靈現在飄在半空，根本沒辦法下來。
I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do except wait until the effect wears off.
我不知道我該怎麼辦了，只能在這裡等它效果消失。
Here, I have one more. You should take it, I've done enough damage as it is.
給，就是一顆這樣的石頭，你拿走吧，我已經受夠了。
I hope someone comes along soon. Me and my Pokemon are starting to get hungry.
趕緊來人幫忙啊，我和我的精靈都餓了。
Phew. One of the scientists was able to help reverse the effects of the Float Stones.
呼，還好有知道該怎麼解決這種問題的研究員在。
Crisis averted!

If you round up my old team and bring 'em here for me to look at, I'll give you this Catching Charm I've been holdin' on to.

Ah, hello. A trainer, I take it?
啊，你好。你是一名訓練家吧?
And a foreigner as well. Don’t ask me how I can tell – it’s plain enough. Well, we’re alike in that.
而且你還是外國人。不要問我怎麼看出來的，很明顯，而且我也是“老外”。
Tell me, have you found any Makyan regional forms yet?
你見過馬凱亞特有的精靈地區形態嗎？
I hadn’t realized they were so poorly-known.
它們知名度這麼低？
Every region has its own unique environmental pressures. In the most extreme cases, these lead to radically different subspecies of Pokémon.
因為每個地區環境不同，會使部分精靈在極端條件下，產生與正常形態截然不同的亞種。
Makya is home to its fair share.
馬凱亞地區也有一些這樣的精靈。
How unfortunate. I hear Makyan Sentrets have been a favorite of trainers seeking to challenge Eko.
真可惜，聽說馬凱亞地區的尾立，已經進化成那些想要挑戰艾克的訓練家們的最愛。
Perhaps you could benefit from one?
對你來說應該也是不錯的選擇。
Good. I can imagine they’d be invaluable to a trainer.

More options is rarely a downside, now is it?

Very good. I’ll be taking notes, if you don’t mind.
很好，你如果不介意，我會把這場對戰記錄下來。
Would you agree to a quick battle, then?
要來一場快速對決嗎？
Well fought.
打得好！
It certainly is a peculiar creature, isn’t it? That eye-like structure isn’t a sensory organ – at least not in the traditional sense.
這種生命的確很神奇對吧？那個像眼睛一樣的結構不是傳統意義上的視覺器官。
It projects psychic force and enables some kind of limited telepathy.
它可以將精神力量投射到現實，並實現某種程度上的心靈感應。
What pressures could cause such an adaptation…? Perhaps some manner of Fighting-type predator?

Ah, but forgive me for wasting your time.
啊，不好意思浪費你時間了。
Here, take these. Perhaps you’ll do some field research of your own, eh?
給，拿著這些吧，這樣你自己也能進行實地調查了。
I’ve heard of a pair of Makyan Pokémon on the <imp>banks of the Eleig River</imp>.

My Pokemon is mad at me for being such a couch potato.
我的精靈跟我鬧矛盾了，因為我總是長在沙發裡。
It should probably be out in the world rather than stuck here with me.
它的確應該去外面多逛逛，而不是跟我一樣懶散。
Hmm... maybe it's time to find a Ghost-type Pokemon.
嗯...或許找一隻幽靈屬性的精靈會合適一些。

OK, stick with me on this one: y'know Helena? She's, what, in her forties?
嘿，你聽我說：你認識海倫娜嗎？她大概四十多歲對吧?
So that means she was in her thirties when she was some Team Chasm bigshot. What'd she do before that?

住在那裡的孩子們運氣真好，身邊有兩位強大的訓練家。
I don't know what's with that spot. It has to be cursed or something.
真搞不懂那個地方到底咋回事，是被詛咒了還是什麼？
Daily patrols are required. Nothing too bad has happened yet, but it could get much worse.
我們每天每時每刻都得巡邏，雖然目前還沒發生什麼嚴重的事情，但情況可能會變得更糟。
I swear I've been there like four times in three days. I don't even have the patience to write a proper report.
我這三天已經去巡邏了四次，連正式報告都沒心情寫了。
Well, peace or something. Dunno how to end this.
好吧，只能祝願和平啥的...
Multiple avatars have been reported in the sewers.
下水道里出現了多個化身。
While in other situations we might send some Rangers in, it's actually much easier to simply leave them to their business.
在正常情況下，我們或許會派義軍過去處理，但現在最好的辦法是讓它們彼此互相解決。
There are only a few exits, which are staffed by sewer treatment personnel. Each of them are registered trainers.
畢竟下水道只有幾個出口，都由汙水處理人員看守，而且每個工作人員都是訓練家。
The walls down there are hard to dig through, and Trainers rarely travel through there.
地下的牆壁很難挖掘，再者說能力足夠的訓練家太少。
It's more efficient to leave the avatars down there until we have more Rangers available.
目前義軍仍然人手短缺，所以打算等有空了再一併處理。
Witnesses observed multiple avatars destroy the bridge that connects Prizca to southern Makya.
有目擊者看到幾個化身破壞了連接宏禮市和南馬凱亞的橋樑。
This has caused a large disturbance for intra- regional shipping.
這對那片區域的通行造成了很大影響。

怪巖腸道一直是化身活躍的重災區。
Particularly strong avatars have been spotted both on the mountain and within it.
無論是在山上還是洞裡，都出現了一些實力強大的傢伙。
Rangers approaching the situation are advised to be in parties of no smaller than two.
當地的義軍至少得保證兩人一組，絕不能單獨行動。
Inexperienced Trainers are recommended to avoid the area.
經驗不足的訓練家最好遠離那片區域。
Trainers looking to acquire the Patience and Perseverance Badges are recommended to travel via Grouz or Svait.

Personal Note: The situation is such a mess. We really need more staff on hand. Or funding. Or free food.
個人備註：現在情況爛到極限了。我們需要更多的人手、鈔票或者免費的補給。
Can we get something other than camping rations over here? Please?
除了那種硬邦邦乾糧以外，咱們能不能弄點靠譜的玩意兒來？擬人一點吧！

Rangers patrolling Grouz have observed strange sightings of a potential four-legged avatar.
在古治鎮巡邏的義軍發現了一個四條腿的奇怪化身。
While previous patrols have confirmed the existence of avatar activity in the area, this particular sighting is rather unique.
的確當地的確早就有其他化身活動的痕跡，但這次發現的化身格外不同。
Every avatar sighted in the area has been confirmed as Steel-type, and all known four-legged Steel-type Pokemon are too slow to match observed movement.
此次出現的化身不僅速度極快，與之前的其他四足化身不同，也並非當地常見的鋼屬性。
A local living in the area has reported multiple strange sightings in the surrounding area.
當地的居民報告稱，曾多次在周圍看到奇怪的景象。
The proximity of his home to Gigalith's Guts makes his case plausible, but his reports don't seem to match the avatars known to be in the area.
目擊位置與怪巖腸道很近，使得此次報告的可信度提高，但他對化身的描述卻並不尋常。
Notably, he has also reported sighting two different Pokemon. The sighting locations and timings from other reports corroborate his story.
根據 現場的破壞跡象，可以推出是由一隻強大的化身所為。
The destruction left at the sites of each sighting suggest an incredibly powerful avatar.
但目擊者卻聲稱看到了兩隻種類完全不同的精靈。
Rangers looking to confirm these reports are advised to be in parties of no smaller than two.

TV here is so dull.
這裡的電視也忒無聊了。
Nothin' but trashy dramas and fretting about avatars.
除了爛俗的肥皂劇和對化身的瞎操心以外，沒有半分錢看頭。

The Alolan Rattata seems to really appreciate that you saved it.
阿羅拉小拉達似乎很感激你救了它。
It must have been left here by its owner and then chased by the avatar of Arbok.
它肯定是被主人丟在了這裡，然後才被阿柏怪的化身追殺的。
It seems like it wants you to catch it.
它好像想讓你抓住它。
Would you like to use a Poke Ball?
你想使用精靈球嗎？
If you tried to catch it, it probably wouldn't put up a fight.

This place is LuxTech's Cold Storage Facility.
這裡是光華是的冷藏設施。
It serves two functions.
大致有兩個功能。
The first is to cut server running costs by keeping the hardware at low temperatures.
一是通過讓硬件保持在低溫來縮減服務器運行的成本。
The second is to act as a physical storage area for frozen products.
二是充當冷凍產品的存儲區。
Occasionally a Pokemon will fail out of our cold survival training course.
但是有些時候，我們會收到一些無法適應這裡工作的精靈。
This Sewaddle didn't make it through.
這隻蟲寶包顯然就是其中之一，它根本不會製冷。
I need a Pokemon that'll definitely fill the slot.
我需要一隻能製造冰塊或者能使周圍降溫的精靈。
Pretty much any Ice-type should do. If you have one, I'll trade you for it.
基本所有冰系精靈都行，要是你有的話，我會拿它跟你換。
Well, not like it's going anywhere.
好吧，反正它不會跑掉。
Hmm. Come back if you manage to get an Ice-type.
你要是抓到冰屬性精靈，就回來找我們吧。
Great, let's get this started.
太好了，讓我們開始吧。
Time to put this guy to work! Thanks!
是時候讓這傢伙幹活了！謝謝!
This Pokemon is going to be cooling rooms like nobody's business.
這隻精靈能夠讓房間保持低溫。
I train and manage the Pokemon here who act as living conditioning units.
我在這裡訓練和管理精靈，它們就跟空調似的為房間調溫。

I'm the director of operations here. The lead system administrator.
我是這裡的運營主任，也是主要系統管理員。
You would think that they would put me in a better office, but no.
你是不是以為他們會給我安排一個更好的辦公室，但實際上並沒有。
Apparently my "expertise" means I need to be "on- site"..."at all times"...
貌似我的“主任”頭銜就是“主動加班”的主和...“任勞任怨”的任...
Ugh. At least the Pokemon here keep me company.
啊，至少還有精靈陪著我。
Most of our servers are in here, but some of the older ones we keep in a room in the lower level.
大部分服務器都在這裡了，但一些較為古老的則在底層。
It's pretty dark and dingy. I try to go there as little as possible.

The Seel seems distressed. It gives you and the worker nervous glances.
這隻小海獅好像很焦慮，它不安地瞥了你和工人幾眼。
It probably just wants to get out of here. Being stuck in a shipping crate didn't help.

It doesn't seem like it will try to fight if you catch it.
如果你想抓住它，它或許不會反抗。
Would you like to use a Pokeball?

You don't have a Pokeball to give it.
你沒有精靈球留給它。
The rangers at Velenz requested a shipment of food.
夜幽市的義軍要求我們運送一批食物過去。
I have their whole order here, but there's an extra thing inside.
我拿到了他們的訂單，但裡面多了一樣奇怪的東西。
Someone must have slipped it in here while no one was looking.
一定是某人趁別人不注意時悄悄放進去的。
Take this, you look like you'll put it to good use.
拿著這個吧，看樣子它對你能派上用場。
I'm not even sure if everything in here needs to be stored at cold temperatures...
我懷疑這些東西並不是都需要低溫保存…
Well, I suppose it's not my place to ask questions.
好吧，我想這不是我該問的問題。
Hey, mind coming over here for a moment?
嘿，你能過來一下嗎？
This Seel was stuck in one of the crates. No idea how.
這隻小海獅不知怎麼的，被跟著箱子運進來了。
It seems really scared, so...while we could just put it to work here in Cold Storage, I think it'd be more humane to get it out of here.
它看起來很害怕，所以...雖然我可以讓它在這裡工作，但還是找人帶它離開更好一些。
You're a Trainer, right? Do you think you could take it in?
你是訓練家，對吧？你願意收留它嗎?
Thanks for allowing that Seel to go with you.
感謝你給了它一個家。

Hello stranger.
你好，陌生人。
Are you here to find the gym leader as well? He has been quite elusive.
你也是來找道館館主的麼？他向來都是神龍見首不見尾。
I have come here to meditate. Doing so in such a place brings me peace.
我特來此地，是為了坐禪。在此等勝境參悟，必使我心神得以安定。
You are free to take the seat next to me, if you would like.
如果你有心的話，儘可安坐我旁的座席。
That was... strange.
這真是...玄之又玄。
Whatever had caused that nightmare seems to be gone now.
無論是什麼邪祟引起了那場驚夢，如今似乎都不知所終了。
I'm guessing that you're the reason for that.
我料想你就是那個緣由。
Perhaps we may finally be able to meditate in peace.
或許我們終於可以安心地坐忘了。
It seems that I should give you a token of my gratitude.
看來我應當給你一點小禮以表謝意。
You've more than proven that you are worthy of it.
你已經證明了你與它的緣分。
Best of luck, friend.
朋友，願你善結良緣。
Make sure to give you and your Pokemon ample rest.
務必要讓你的精靈好好休養一番。
It is nice to finally have some company.
總算有位同道中人，也算得上一件幸事。
Let me walk you through the process.
讓我來為你一一點撥吧。
The journey here must have been long. You must feel extremely tired.
來到此處的道路定然曲折迢迢。你必感疲累難當。
Feel your eyelids droop. Let your mind drift.
容你的眼簾漸漸闔上。任你的心神飄蕩自如。
Relax.
心無雜念，忘我兼忘世。
You wake up in a cold sweat.
你猛然驚醒，全身被冷汗溼透。

How long have I been here?

The last thing I remember was...
我記得的最後一件事...
What was it?

You feel your eyes close again, though you don't remember closing them.
你感覺眼睛又閉上了，可你怎樣都想不起究竟是何時閉上的。
I...
我...
I'm not sure where we are.
我不清楚我們在哪裡。
We were back at the house a moment ago, right?
我們剛才還在屋子裡，對吧？
It's cold, and I can't find my Pokemon anywhere...
好冷啊，我找不到我的精靈了...
Can you just...
你能不能...
Give me some space...
讓我單獨思考下狀況...
Why hello there traveller!
嗨旅行者，你好啊!
Can you sense those spirits around you?
你能察覺到周圍的那些鬼魂嗎？
They watch us all the time from their little hidey-holes.
它們總是躲在各個角落裡死死地盯著我們。
They seem quite angry at you. Why would you do such a thing to upset them?
它們對你的怨氣很大。你到底做了什麼事才惹怒了它們?
Are you lost?
你迷路了嗎？
That's too bad. Maybe you'll be stuck here too.
這下麻煩大了，搞不好你永遠都出不去了，和大家一起困在這鬼地方。

It looks like the machine is dead. You can't heal your Pokemon here.
這臺機器好像壞了，你無法在這裡治療你的精靈。
The PC is dead. You can't access your storage from here.

I'll take your Pokémon for a few seconds.
請允許我暫時拿走您的精靈。
Hehe. Just kidding.
哈哈，騙到你了！
[Map103]
I am going to be very honest with you.
我受不了了！
The whole searching for the gym leader ordeal has been the last straw.
我真的受夠了，我不想再四處尋找道館館主了！
I don't want to compete in Makya anymore. I want to go somewhere that has a sane Pokemon League.
我不想再參加馬凱亞競技大會了，我要去一些正常點的地區，繼續我的精靈聯盟旅程。
Like Unova. Or Sinnoh. Sinnoh sounds nice.
比如說合眾或者神奧...神奧感覺挺不錯的。
I caught this Magby for one reason -- to beat this gym.
之前我抓這隻鴨寶寶...就是為了擊敗這個道館。
Since I'm no longer trying, I want to trade it for something else.
現在我用不著它了，我打算用它交換其他的精靈。
I want a Shinx. I love how they look and I want something that's popular in Sinnoh.
我想要一隻小貓怪，它們非常和我的喜好，而且在神奧地區也很流行（在箱子裡選擇精靈）。
Sure, whatever.
行吧，隨便你。
Come back if you do find a Shinx.
你要是真找到了小貓怪再過來吧。
Nice, maybe this'll motivate me once I land in Sinnoh.
很好，等我到了神奧地區，這或許能成為我前進的動力
Finally, now I can get out of this dump.
現在我終於可以離開這破地方了。
The caves under this town are rather dangerous...

Andris gave each of us -- us gym leaders -- one of these keys.
安德里斯給了館主們各一把鑰匙。
They’re for these doors, these prisons.
都是這些門...這些監獄的鑰匙。
Behind all that bluster about Champions and badges and all that, this is our real purpose. At least, it’s supposed to be.
在接受挑戰、頒發徽章等表象背後，但這才是我們真正的使命。也是事情本來的樣貌。
Seems like I’m the only one taking this seriously.
看起來只有我是最認真的那個。
So, please, take this key, go through that door, and get rid of that thing.
所以請拿著這把鑰匙，通過那扇門，把那個東西消滅掉。
You gonna go after the avatar? Until it’s gone, I can’t leave... just in case.
你要去找化身嗎？只有它消失了，我才能離開...
Just. In. Case.
務必小心。
You’re back? Really? I mean, fine, but please stop.
真的假的？你回來了？我的意思是，隨便了，但還是就此打住吧。
Another challenger? How inhospitable does this place have to get before you lunatics give up?
又來個挑戰者？這個地方究竟要變成什麼樣，你們這些瘋子才會放棄？
Do I look like I have the time to duel you? That isn’t my job, you know.
我看起來像有時間和你戰鬥嗎？你也知道，這不是我的職責。
My job is to guard this door until I can find someone strong enough to defeat what’s inside.
我的職責就是守護這扇門，直至尋到足夠強大的人來擊敗裡面的東西。
And for some insane reason they thought sending a parade of children at me was a good way to do that.
但是我不知道他們是怎麼想的，竟然覺得派來一群孩子就能搞定。
But fine. We’ll fight.
行行行，那我們就打一場。
I run doubles, and doubles only. You ready for that?
我這邊是雙打比賽，而且只有雙打，準備好了？
Great. Maybe I can get some soil samples today.
行吧。也許我今天可以採集一些土壤樣本。
I used to be a scientist, you know...
你知道嗎，我以前是一名科學家...
You’ve got the aura of someone with real audacity.
你身上有一種敢作敢為的氣質。
The only reason I’m here is to find a true Pokémon master, and you’ve at least got the ferocity fighting your way to me.
我來這裡的唯一原因是找到一位真正的精靈大師，而你在與我對戰的過程中所展現出的激烈攻勢，也算符合了我的要求。
Fine. You’re here for more than an easy badge.
很好，我明白了。你來這裡可不僅僅是為了枚徽章。
Show me what you got.
讓我看看你有什麼本事。
Sure thing. The sooner I lose to you, the sooner you get out of here and back somewhere safe, I suppose.
當然，你輸的越快，就可以越早地離開這裡。
Do it.
來吧。
Finally. How many years and I finally – it’s done! It’s done!
終於，多少年了！我終於...等到了！等到了！
You. Take the Reverence Badge. You’ve more than earned it.
你，收下這枚崇敬徽章吧。這是你應得的。
Now, this door. My true responsibility.

Yep. You’re still pretty good.
沒錯，你還是很厲害。
I can’t give you another badge.
但我沒法再給你一枚徽章。
Please leave me alone.
請別煩我了。
I hope you’re happy.
我希望你會為此而高興。
Suicidal dive into dangerous territory, hunt me down, force me to waste time fighting you.
冒著生命危險到這種地方來找我，逼我浪費時間和你戰鬥。
And for what, a big old game?
這一切都是為了什麼，一場老掉牙的遊戲嗎？
Take your badge.
拿走你的徽章吧。
And, yeah, I’m not angry with you, got it? I’m angry with Helena and Andris and everyone for setting this up.
我沒有生你的氣。我是在生海倫娜、安德里斯，以及所有決策層的氣。
Now get outta here, ‘kay?
現在可以走了嗎？
Please, let's not do this right now.
拜託，別再來了。
When the tournament is on, it's the only time of the year I can take a break from handling crazy trainers all day.

There’s a newly-painted sign here.
這裡有個挺新的路牌。
It reads “Rafael gone. Connor is gym leader now?”
上面寫著“拉斐爾走了，新館主為康納？？？？？”
There are many, many question marks.
後面跟著一長串問號。
An old combination lock keeps the door shut tight.
一把老式的密碼鎖將門緊緊地鎖住了。
Reading off the slips of paper you found, you enter the code onto the locks.
你看著找到的紙條，輸入著上面的密碼。
After a bit of jostling, the lock opens!
輕輕地晃動一下，鎖就打開了！
It takes eight digits, but with enough finagling you'd be able to open it with just <imp>four</imp>.
需要輸入八位數字，但是隻要耍點小聰明，只要有<imp>四</imp>位數字就可以窮舉了。
Oh, heya.
哦，你好。
So... I'm a gym leader now. I guess.
所以...我就是道館館主...現在...大概...吧...
Didn't even really expect to see Rafeal again. He just kinda climbed down, patted me on the shoulder, and told me.
沒想到再見到拉斐爾後，他只是輕輕地拍了拍我的肩膀...
Said all the paperwork or whatever was done. So, uh... yeah.
說所有的文件都辦好了...然後...呃...我就...
Gym Leader Connor is coming soon!
總之，我現在之道館館主康納。
Just need to get a proper doubles team together...
現在得試著組建一支適合雙打的隊伍...
WHOA!
哇！
WHAT KIND'A UGLY POKEMON ARE YA?!
你 是 什 麼 東 西 ？
Rafael told me to battle any avatar that might come through here.
拉斐爾告訴我要跟所有通過這裡的化身戰鬥。
I forgot my glasses at home today so I can't see anything more than a foot in front of me.
今天又忘了帶眼鏡，所以看什麼都很模糊。
Sorry for confusing you with a Pokemon, you can pass through.
抱歉把你和精靈搞混了，你可以過去了。
Rafael is up ahead. Though, the door to the front is locked.
拉斐爾就在前面，不過，前門被鎖住了。
If you want in, you'll need the combo code. I wrote the digits on some slips of paper, but lost 'em a while back.
如果你想進去，就需要輸入密碼。我把密碼寫在一些紙條上，但前陣子弄丟了。
Sorry, but if you want in to fight Rafael, you'll have to find those slips.
抱歉，如果你想和拉斐爾較量，就得先找到那些紙條。
The lock is really old, so you only need half of the eight digits, I'd wager.
當然如果你願意動動腦，或許並不需要找到所有密碼。
Rafael's Pokemon League Representative quit years ago, so I'll have to brief you on his team.
拉斐爾已經不做聯盟代表好多年了，所以我得向你介紹一下他的隊伍。
Rafael uses a mix of Grass and Ghost-type Pokemon.
他喜歡用的是草和幽靈系的精靈。
This means that Fire, Flying, Ice, and Dark types do well here.
這就說明火、飛行、冰和惡四種屬性可以在這裡大展身手。
He's not just his types, however. He wouldn't have been able to guard this place for so long without a trick up his sleeve.
不過他對屬性並沒有那麼依賴，能在這裡擔任這麼久的館主，多少都是有一些絕招的。
His team is built around the Dancer ability.
據說他的隊伍核心是舞者特性。
When you see him send out his Bellossom or his Alolan Marowak...
等你看到他派出美麗花或者阿羅拉嘎啦嘎啦時...
Well, all I'm saying is be prepared.
嗯，我只能說，好好準備吧。
Best of luck, friend.
祝你好運，朋友。
You managed to win against Rafael?
你戰勝了拉斐爾？
Great work, you got some real grit.
幹得漂亮，你真有實力。
If the avatar problem here ever gets sorted out, I'll try to go watch your next high profile match live.
等這裡的化身問題都搞定了，我就去現場觀看你下場比賽。
Well I'll be damned.
我這是見鬼了麼。
After all this time, I finally got to see Rafael leave his post.
這麼長時間了，第一次看到拉斐爾離開他的崗位。
He had the biggest damn smile I've ever seen on him.
他臉上露出了迄今為止我見過的最燦爛的笑容。
You did good.
你做得很好。
You've probably saved me and Rafael a lot of cash as well.
這或許能幫我們節省一些資金。
We're down here most of the time, so we've lost a lot of money getting food delivered to us.
由於我們大部分時間都在這裡，所以花了很多錢來運送食物。
Helena would probably kill us if she found out how much we've spent on delivery fees...
如果讓海蓮娜發現我們在送餐費上花了多少錢，她可能會殺了我們...

There's so many avatars around here. How am I ever supposed to get my badge?
這裡的化身也太多了，我到底得怎樣才能拿到徽章？
Man, if regular trainers are destroying me, no way I'm gonna beat the Gym Leader.
如果普通的訓練家都能打敗我，那我肯定打不過道館館主。
I have no idea where the Gym Leader is, but I do know one thing.
我不知道道館館主在哪裡，但我清楚地知道一件事。
Avatars are scary!

I'm here to help with the avatars, so I don't think I'm supposed to help with your gym challenge.
我是來幫忙對付化身的，所以我沒辦法幫你挑戰道館。
Now go, before somebody overhears.
在被其他人看到前，趕緊離開這裡。
I guess I have no choice but to let you go.
既然我攔不住你，那隻能讓你離開了。
I think I have to fight you again the next time I see you...
下次再見面時，我還會跟你打一場...

我被上級派來幫忙解決化身...我？我真辦不到...
Are you looking for the Gym Leader? I've only heard rumors.
你在找道館館主嗎？我只聽說過一些他的傳言。
Apparently he's shacked up in one of the buildings.
說是他一直躲在一棟建築裡。
Dunno which one though.
但我不知道是哪一棟。
Well. I'll just be here. Chilling. Yeah.
好吧，來都來了，放鬆...放鬆下來...
I am chill. Calm. Relaxed. Chilled.
我很冷靜，我很放鬆...

So it’s you again. I presume my impostor’s amulet is keeping you safe?
又是你...是那個冒牌貨的護身符保護了你？
My name – our name – is <imp>Imogene</imp>.
我的名字...我們的名字...是<imp>伊莫珍</imp>。
The Ditto is around here somewhere, I imagine. I can’t ever lose her.
那個百變怪就在這附近，我想我們都不會失去彼此。
We were wandering Kalos before deciding to come home to Makya.
我們之前在卡洛斯遊歷，後來決定回到馬凱亞。
If we can settle this matter of identity anywhere, it will be here.
這裡應該是我們唯一，能分清誰真誰假的地方。
And as for this cave, I have a request.
至於這個洞窟，我有一個請求。
Indeed you can. I did not choose this barren cave at random.
的確需要你的幫助，我並不是隨便選了這個地方。
It is a place of power, and I intend to prove myself the real Imogene once and for all.
這是一個擁有能量的地方，至少這一次，我要證明自己是真的伊莫珍。
*sigh*
*嘆氣*
I am the real Imogene. The other woman that looks like me is my Ditto doppelganger, who claims just the opposite.
我是真正的伊莫珍，那個長得像我一樣的女人是我的百變怪分身，當然她的說法完全相反。
And I would like prove her wrong here and now.
我要在這裡證明她是錯的。
Fire-cracked bones can be read to divine the future. Ice forms a mirror that reflects oneself.
火燒骨可以用來占卜未來，冰則可以形成反映自己的鏡子。
Let us combine the two – crater this ice with a duel and see our true identities in the fractures.
讓我們把兩者結合起來 - 就在這個洞窟裡決鬥，讓我們的真實身份在裂縫中顯露。
Not without me you don’t! I’d rather you hex me than try and perform a reading without me!
必須我們一起來完成這一切！我寧願你施咒詛咒我，也不希望你在沒有我參與的情況下進行占卜！
The both of us, against our beloved traveler!
以我們兩個，對抗我們心愛的旅行者！
Fine… I’ll hold my horses. But don’t leave us waiting.
好吧...我會等著你的，但不要讓我們等太久。
Good! Quail before my inner fire, and reveal your soul to my eye!
好！在我的內心火焰面前屈服，讓我看到你的靈魂！
…You battle with shocking clarity.
...你的戰鬥思路驚人地清晰。
Unbowed, even before the both of us.
即使在我們兩人面前也不肯屈服。
Fascinating…
太有趣了...
These hairline fractures… the ice shrapnel… hmm.
這些細小的裂縫…冰雪彈片…嗯。
It portends nonsense. Gibberish.
這預示著...謊言。
That both of us are dead already, and the same regardless.
我們兩個都已經死了，而且無論如何都是一樣的。
And look at the scarring around our oh-so-helpful ritualist?
再來看看好心的協助者身邊形成了怎樣的痕跡吧。
So your name is \PN.
所以你的名字是\PN。
And, what, you will walk backwards? You are a bridge that opposes heroes and villains?
那麼，你能稍微退後一點嗎？你即是一座橋樑，又是英雄與惡棍？
Something about nostalgia, but I think you stepped on that part.
還有很多懷念的...那一部分被你踩到了。
Nothing of use, then. Not to us, at least. I hope our makeshift augury at least did you some good.
沒什麼很有用的東西，至少對我們來說是如此，希望我們的臨時占卜至少對你能有所幫助。
If not, forgive this flight of fancy wasting your time. Remember: SHE came up with the idea.
如果沒有的話，請原諒我們浪費了你的時間。另外，這是她出的主意。
Hmm… maybe this trip was worth more than that changeling imagines.
嗯…也許這次旅行比那個冒牌貨想象得更有價值。
If you ever find yourself in the urban expanse with naught to do, find me.
如果你在什麼地方無事可做了，那就去試著找我吧。
I’ll be at the riverside, like as not. I have plans involving you and yours.
我很可能會在河邊，我可能有一些關於你還有你的精靈的計劃。
Whoa! Is all well?
哇！一切都好嗎？
Here – I suppose I can spare some supplies. Let us get your team in shape, shall we?
這些補給品給你了...應該可以抽調出一些來。讓我幫你的精靈恢復好嗎？
Go find out if my… companion… is ready.
去看看我的…伴侶…準備的怎麼樣了。
She requires far more preparation than I.
她總比我需要更長時間。
Have you made ready?
你準備好了嗎？
If you ever find yourself in the <imp>urban expanse</imp> of Prizca with naught to do, find me.
如果你在大城市裡無事可做了，來找我。
Why are you here?
你為什麼在這？
Can I help?
我能幫忙嗎？
...What?
...什麼？
Hold up.
等一下
Let's go.

The storage PC in the Pokemon Center here is busted, so we set up an impromptu one here.

We rangers are trying to keep the avatar problem here under control.
我們一直在試圖控制這裡的局勢。
The results have been...
但結果一直不太理想...
Less than optimal.
它們太強了。

\wm\ss\l[3]By entering this door, you will cause events that <imp>cannot be undone</imp>.
\wm\ss\l[3]進入這扇門後，將會觸發<imp>無法再撤回</imp>的事件。

...Ain’t really feelin’ it today, \PN.
啊...我今天感覺不太好，\PN。
Y’know, I’m a fan of yours, gotta admit. Like your style. Like how you move. Like how you fight.
我不得不承認，現在是你的粉絲了，我喜歡你的風格和戰鬥方式。
Remind me of Yez, more than a li’l. But... I just ain’t feelin’ up to small talk. Today’s a day for big happenings, y’see?
你總是讓我想到葉澤拉...不過今天我不打算閒聊，畢竟有一件大事正在發生，對吧？
Sure hope so. It ain’t exactly subtle. So, now, let’s figure this out 'tween you and me.
那就好，現在可不太妙，現在就由我們來解決它吧。
Which of us is better, who’s gonna be the one going down there, the whole shebang.
看看我們誰是那個最後解決掉一切的人。
You even gotta ask ‘bout that? Y’know how this goes. Always.
你連這都需要問我？你明明知道發生了什麼。
Ain’t no other way for us folks. We got somethin’ to figure out: which one of us is gonna have to give Yez a talking-to.
我們沒別的辦法了，必須得找個機會，無論是你也好，我也罷，跟葉澤拉好好談談。
Oh, don’tcha go callin’ it a crush. Just got a lot of traits I’m half-partial to.
呃...這可不是那種“喜歡”，我只是欣賞你身上的某些特質。
Ain’t 'bout to change what we gotta do. One of us gotta go down there.
先別說這些了，正事要緊，我們當中必須有人下到最後。
I’m her friend. You’re her... well, you’re a lotta things.
我是她的朋友，而你...呃...你有很多身份。
I figure you got a better chance of beating her than I do, but I gotta double-check.
而且我覺得你比我更有機會打敗她，不過現在我得再確認一下。
Aw, who am I kiddin’? I’m nervous, kid. I ain’t got the guts to face her and tell her what needs sayin’.
我不是在開玩笑，小傢伙，我現在其實很緊張，我也不太確定該怎樣面對她。
So c’mon. Gimme an excuse to give up.
所以，給我個放棄的藉口。
Figured if there was one thing ya could do, it’d be this.
這就是我的理解之中，你能做到的事。
Hah! Knew I liked you.
哈哈，我果然很喜歡你的風格。
Nah. Never could say no to her, not when it mattered.
不，我怕我在關鍵時刻，無法狠下心來拒絕她。
You let me know when you’re 'bout ready, and we’ll do this. Ain’t no two ways about it.
準備好了就告訴我吧，這件事沒得商量！
Take your time and make it good. I wanna be facin’ the whole nine yards, y’hear?
慢慢來，不著急，說不定關二爺還會給你九個聖盃呢！
Ah, good. Prove me right. Show me I ain’t nothin’.
很好，證明你比我更合適吧。
But, uh, I ain’t ‘bout to go down easy. \PN, meet the team I’ve been honing since the good ol’ days. Meet Drag-Mag.
不過...呃...我是不會輕易認輸的，\PN，來見識一下我這些年的積累，以及曾經的特工“狂風”吧。
...'Bout figures.
...就是這樣。
Well, I ain’t gonna sugarcoat it: it’s your job now. Always was, lookin’ at it a certain kinda way.
我不想粉飾什麼太平，現在這是你的工作。
Go down there. Talk some sense into her. Y’know how. Ain’t much else to say, is there?
到下面去跟她講講道理，你知道該怎麼做，不需要我多說了對吧？
You know whatcha gotta do. Don’t need me holdin’ your hand. Good kid.
你應該知道要怎麼做，小傢伙，你不需要我牽著你的手。
Oh, don’tcha go thankin’ me yet. I ain’t done nothin’ for ya. Nothin’ material.
哈，不用謝我，我什麼都沒為你做過，至少現在還是這樣。
I was plannin’ to.
我當然也會出一份力。
I ain’t ‘bout to go down there myself with ya – it’s a private affair. Can’t ruin my reputation by barging on in and making a muck of things.
但我不想親自跟你下去...我不想毀了自己的招牌，闖進去大鬧一番，卻最終把結果推向更糟。
Hah. Don’t embarrass me. Maybe after all’s said and done, we can grab a drink together.
哈哈，別讓我難堪，或許等一切結束之後，我可以請你一起去喝一杯。
You, me, Yez... or just you and me, if that’s your drift.
你，我，還有葉澤拉...當然如果你想的話，也可以只有我們兩個。
Just don’tcha go being one of those folks asking me to step on ‘em. Hah!
但你可別表現得像那些被我踩扁的討厭傢伙一樣，哈哈！
You’re gonna need a li’l help to get to tomorrow, though.
為了明天，這是我對你的資助。
Take my Heatran. I don’t see myself fightin’ too many wars in my near future, and for anythin’ less my regulars will do well enough.
把我的席多藍恩帶走吧，將來我可能不會再打硬仗了，平時，一般的精靈也就夠了。
You, though? You oughta take anything you can get.
你覺得呢？我不覺得你會拒絕這份提議。
Take good care of that damn thing, y’hear? We go way back.
好好照顧那個鬼東西，哈哈，怎麼說也是老夥計了。
And, besides, it’s a damn juggernaut that can wreak more carnage than a babyface like you can even imagine.
別小看這個巨無霸，它所能造成的破壞，絕對遠超你這“娃娃臉”的想象。
Hah! I ain’t never been able to tell if you’re brave or stupid. In my experience, they ain’t much different.
哈哈，我一直都分辨不出，你到底是勇敢還是愚蠢，雖說以我的經驗，這兩者沒區別。
As you say, though. Ain’t gonna complain 'bout keepin’ an extra ace up my sleeve.
當然，我當然不會抱怨，自己手裡能多留一張王牌。
Well, I s’pose we oughta keep it brief, all things considered. You gotta go hunt that girl down, and I gotta go prep for either which way it ends.
我們還是長話短說，去追上那個女孩吧，而我得為一切可能的結局做準備。
I’ll be seein’ her soon, one way or another. Probably won’t be too keen on seein’ me, but that’s friends for ya.
不管怎樣，我很快就會見到她...當然她可能不太想見到我吧，但這就是朋友，哈哈！
Hey, \PN, I figure this comes as an awful surprise to you, but I got a secret.
對了，\PN，你可能...會對我接下來，所說的這個祕密感到驚訝。
Up until now, I’ve been workin’ with Yez, clandestine-like. Masked, causin’ havoc, fightin’ you. I ain’t proud of it, but it ain’t far from my usual.
其實在此之前，我一直在跟葉澤拉合作...那些...製造混亂也好，和你對決也罷...這與我的一貫作風差別不大，但我不會以此為榮。
I’m a black ops gal born and raised, though I’m a mite more on the side of cut-and-burn than cloak-and- dagger.
我是一個在這裡土生土長的探員，雖然我更擅長暴力解決對手，而不是戴上面具做一個忍者。
I ain’t 'bout to apologize. But, uh, Yez’d have me stoppin’ you, and I ain’t 'bout to play that game.
我不會為這些事情道歉的，但是...呃...葉澤拉肯定會讓我阻止你，我卻不想再玩這種遊戲了。
She got other lackeys, good on her, but I ain't gonna be one of 'em.
她還有其他的支持者，但我不會再是其中之一了。
Go ruin her day, kid. I’ll see you around.
去給她當頭一棒吧，回頭見，小傢伙。
Hey, next time I see ya, drinks are on me. Call it my way of making up to you. Heh. So long, kid.
對了，別忘了下次見面的邀約，一起去喝一杯，就當是補償了，再見！
\PN, go ruin her day. I wish I was good enough to do it myself, but I just ain’t.
\PN，去毀了她的計劃吧，我當然也想親自這樣做，但...我還是狠不下心...
You understand her well enough. She’ll listen to you, one way or the other.
你很瞭解她不是嗎？起碼她多少會聽你的話。
And, uh, sorry. For makin’ this all ‘bout her. If things were any different, I’d love to chat ‘bout other things.
而且...呃...對不起，如果沒有這一檔子事的話，我倒是很樂意跟你聊些別的。
Maybe some day, yeah? I’ll see you around, I promise.
或許會有能放下一切的一天...回頭再見吧，我保證會來找你。
You come back and there’s still bars left in the world, drinks are on me, y’hear? See ya around, kid.
如果等你回來之後，這個世界的酒館還在，那我們就去喝一杯吧，走了，小傢伙！

比如說拯救了那個地區？這真是超出我最高期待的答卷，我對你很滿意，\PN。
Now, I haven’t been able to get in contact with Zain, but to be honest, after that showing...? I’m not sure we have much to talk about right now.
不過，自從比賽後我就聯繫不上贊恩了...當然也沒什麼可跟他談的。
Ignore him, though. He’s just moping because he couldn’t beat you. To be honest, I never thought he could.
或許只是因為輸給你而悶悶不樂吧，而且我從沒想過他能贏。
Today’s about you. Aww, honey, you did so well! I can get a private flight scheduled to get you back home ASAP. I’ve got big plans for you.
現在就不聊他了，親愛的，我可以儘快安排私人航班接你回來，還給你準備了一個大計劃。

It’s Mavis. You have to answer.

I got an idea. If you can beat it in a battle, it'll demand to join your team.
我有個注意，如果你能打敗它，那就把它帶走吧！
It'll thrive with a trainer. What do you say?
有個訓練家的話，它就能茁壯成長了。
I just want to get it off the cliff so we can get out of here.
我真想給它丟下懸崖，這樣我就能回家了。
Place feels dangerous.
當然只是說氣話。
Wonderful. Give me a second.
太好了，給我一點時間。
HEY! YOU GOT SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO BATTLE!
嘿！有 人 要 跟 你 戰 鬥 ！
GET DOWN HERE!
下 來 吧 ！
Thanks for that.
謝謝你。
As expected, it's practically dying to join your party.
果然，只有這樣它才願意加入。
Well, I suppose that's three months of training down the drain.
雖然這三個月的訓練都白費了...
Peace.
謝天謝地。
My mom told me not to come up here, but I really wanted to see what it was like to pee off the side of a mountain.
我媽媽不讓我來這裡，但我真想體驗一下站在懸崖邊，往下撒尿是什麼感覺。
I uh... don't need to pee anymore. For no real reason.
我...再也不尿尿了...我是說在這種地方。
I felt like peeing off Makya's highest point would be great, but I'm not feeling as liberated as I thought I would be.
我覺得從馬凱亞的最高峰往下尿尿的體驗一定很棒，但並沒有那種想象中的解放感。
I'm scared of heights, but I'm more scared of growing old without making memories.
我有點恐高，但我更怕老去後沒有值得回憶的東西。
That's why I choose where I pee very carefully.
因此，我會非常謹慎地選擇撒尿地點。
\PN! My beloved! The mountains frame your beauty in a way I can only describe as sublime.
\PN！我的愛人！這山脈將你的美麗框在了一種我無法形容的崇高之中。
You look as if you could tear them down around you and build yourself a throne.
彷彿它要將自己拆解掉，形成屬於你的王座。
You don’t need to. All you need is me.
當然你不需要這樣它，你只需要我。
Of course. I always have time to talk with you. Listening to your dulcet voice makes my worries dissipate.
當然可以，我有很多可以和你閒聊的時間，你悅耳的聲音能讓我的煩惱消散。
We can talk about anything. Anything at all.
你想談論些什麼都可以，任何事情都可以。
Why would you come here if not for me? You could’ve stayed away.
如果不是為了我，你為什麼會來這裡？你本可以遠離我。
What draws you to me? You know what it is, I think. We both know. I’d love to show you what you really feel.
是什麼吸引你來找我的？我想你知道這個原因，我們都很清楚，向你自己展示真正的感受吧。
You’re perfect. I see all my love reflected in your eyes. It’s beautiful. I want to hold you so badly.
你是那麼的完美，我看到你的愛意從眼神中毫無保留的映射出來，太美了，我多想抱著你！
Oh, you’re adorable. Such a pure creature.
啊！你真是太可愛了！竟然有如此純潔的生命。
Yes, my love. Always gifts. I’ll get you anything you desire, always. You’re worth more than any material object.
放心吧，我的愛人，我永遠都有東西給你，無論你想要什麼，我都會給你，這就是我對你愛的重量。
...But that must come later.
...不過那必須稍後再說。
\PN. I had planned to propose to you here. But then I was gifted a miracle.
\PN，我本想在這裡向你求婚，但一個奇蹟打破了我原本的計劃。
My undying, fervent wish was made real before my eyes. Our love was consecrated in the eyes of the heavens.
我那不朽與熱烈的願望，就這樣在眼前變成了現實，是我們的愛得到了天堂的祝福。
I knew this gift to us was to be used only one way. You are like Yezera: there’s one language you speak above all others.
不過這份禮物的包裝，只有一種拆解方式，那就是你和葉澤拉一樣，最擅長的那種語言。
I’ve been so selfish, using my words to express how wonderful you are. I should’ve been speaking your language.
我一直都那麼自私，自顧自地用乾癟的語言表達你的美好，我應該換一種你能聽懂的方式。
Let me show you my love. Let me show you the sign I have received. Let our love be made immortal by this glorious omen, shining in the passions of combat.
讓我展示我的愛吧，讓我展示我所接收到的徵兆，讓我們的愛因這個光榮的徵兆而不朽，在戰鬥的激情中閃耀。
Of course, my love. Make yourself ready.
當然，我的愛人，我也不希望你是倉促應戰。
I love you. Allow me to show you just how much.
我愛你。讓我向你展示這份愛的濃郁吧。
...I won’t let you slip away. You’re mine, \PN.
…我不會讓你溜走的，你是我的，\PN。
You don’t understand what I mean yet. Let me show it to you. Let me open your eyes to the love you’ve been missing.
你還不明白我的意思嗎？讓我毫不保留地展示給你看吧，讓我揭開你一直缺失的愛的眼簾。
This is meant to be. Witness the message the heavens gave me.
這是命中註定的，是所見證的上天給我的信息。
You’re making me wait. My heart is pounding. I can’t wait any longer. Will you now bear witness to this sign of our eternal love?
在等待的過程中，我的心一直怦怦跳動，我再也等不了了，來見證我們永恆愛情的徵召吧！
Do you see it? The wish-bringer, come to grant me my wish! The light of our love shining through it! And you, like a star, like an avatar!
你看到了嗎？願望的化身來實現我的期盼了！我們的愛之光因為它閃耀！而你，像一顆星星，一個化身般閃耀！
I wanted Yezera, and I sought the avatars, all to lead me here. To woo a god, and make you mine forever.
無論是葉澤拉，還是化身，我追求他們，都是為了今天，讓命運把我帶到這裡的一刻。追尋神的步伐，讓你永遠屬於我。
Can’t you see? I will do anything for you.
你應該能看得出來吧？我會為你做任何事情。
I will move heaven and earth. I will love you eternally. I will smother you in compassion and affection. I will fill your life with comfort and pleasure.
我會永遠愛你，我會為你移山填海，披荊斬棘，我會用關懷和愛意淹沒你，讓你的生活只剩舒適和愉悅。
I will steal for you. Kill for you. End this world for you, or remake it to be more pleasant for you. So long as you are mine.
我會為了你成為竊賊，為你殺戮，為你毀滅世界，又或者重塑世界，使其更美好，只要你能屬於我...
So long as I can hold you, and love you, and know that you are mine and no one else’s.
只要我能擁抱你，愛你，並確保你是我的，不是其他什麼人的...
I need help? That’s all you can say to me?
我需要治療？這就是你要對我說的全部？
I love you more than anyone has loved anything! Do you expect me to keep it inside, wear masks, be... civil about it?
我愛你勝過任何人，勝過任何事物！你希望我把它藏在心裡，戴上面具，表現得...文明些？
It drives me to madness and back not embracing you here and now! As it should! Everyone else is blind not seeing your radiance!
無法現在擁抱你會讓我瘋掉！這才是最該有的結果！其他人都瞎了，看不到你的光輝！
You are gorgeous and brilliant and divine. What higher accomplishment could there be than to make you mine?
你那麼美麗、聰明、神聖，讓你成為我的，就是此世間最珍貴的成就！
No one could aspire to anything better, except to be you.
除了成為你之外，沒有人能找到更好的追求。
I would for you. Don’t you understand that?
為了你，我願意下地獄，你難道還不明白嗎？
Why would you reject me? I could make your life perfect!
你為什麼要拒絕我？我可以讓你的生活變得完美！
I would do anything for you, and you want to throw that away? Simply because I ask for your love in return? Am I not worthy of that, after everything?
我願意為你做任何事情，而你卻想要拋棄我？僅僅因為我要求你回報我的愛？在經歷了這一切之後，我難道不值得被愛嗎？
I am kind, and loving, and caring, and humble, and I can see your real worth!
我善良、謙虛、有愛心，也懂得關懷別人，還能看到你真正的價值！
Shouldn’t I be more worthy of love than anyone else? Do you think I’m insane?
難道我不比任何人都更值得被愛嗎？你認為我瘋了嗎？
You’re the mad one here if you think you’ll be better off without me. A beautiful mad god that refuses to be helped...
你認為沒有我會更好？哈哈，原來是你瘋了，一個美麗的瘋狂之神，拒絕接受信徒的幫助…
No! I will have you alone. I couldn’t stand to share you with anyone else!
不！你只能有我一個人，我無法忍受與其他人分享你！
Please, you won’t even notice. I will fill your days with joy. You won’t need anyone else.
求求你，你可能沒注意到，我會讓你的生活充滿快樂，你不再需要其他任何人。
If they ask for you, if they want you, I’ll take care of them. They can serve you – us – or they can leave. Our perfect days need no one else.
如果他們需要你，如果他們想要你，我會代你照顧他們。他們可以為你，為我們...服務，或者離開，我們完美的生活不再需要任何人。
After all, I’m the only one that feels this raging love. I’m the only one that knows what you really are. Radiant. Divine.
畢竟，只有我能感受到這股熾烈的愛，只有我知曉你真正的本質，那份光輝與神聖！
Yes. Of course. Hah! Everything is as it should be.
沒錯，就是這樣，哈哈！一切就應該這樣發展！
The entire world is falling into place, my love. You are mine. Forever.
整個世界都在我手手中了，我的愛人，你是我的，永遠！
Love, I’ve been working with Yezera to reset the world. I planned to rule with her, and then later I planned to make it a paradise for us two.
親愛的，我之前一直在和葉澤拉一起重置世界，我原本計劃和她一起統治，再為我們兩個打造一個天堂的。
But now? You’re fighting Yezera, and I’ll gladly choose you over her. She’s nothing to me now. You’re the only one that matters.
但現在，你是她的對立面，我也很樂意選擇你而不是她，她對我來說已經毫無意義了，你是唯一重要的人。
How about this? You go take care of her and make sure she never bothers us. Meanwhile, I’ll be making preparations.
怎麼樣？你去解決掉她，確保她不會再來打擾我們吧，同時，我也會做好準備。
I’ll make your life a dream. A beautiful, idyllic, paradisiacal dream from which you’ll never wake up. Go do what you do best.
我會讓你擁有夢境般的生活，一個美麗、閒適的夢境，你永遠都不需要醒來的夢境。而現在，繼續去做你擅長的事吧。
Oh, the plans I have. My love, just you wait. Please. Don’t hurry yourself. Although... you must have work to attend to.
我有數不清的計劃，我的愛人，在等等吧，請不要著急，而且...你還有些事情要處理。
Oh, please, continue then. I wouldn’t dare take you away from what you do best.
請繼續吧，我不會讓你停下那些。
I need time to prepare, and you need to wrap up these loose ends. Cut these threads away. You don’t need anyone else now.
我需要時間來準備未來，而你需要結束這一些的源頭，當變故被全部切斷之後，你就不再需要任何人了。
\PN, I’m going to make your life a dream. You’re a god... and now you’re mine.
\PN，我會讓你的生活變成一場美好的夢境，現在...你就是獨屬於我的神明瞭。
We’ll be together forever. Forever’s just beginning, and I’m a patient man.
我們將永遠在一起，不...永遠也只是開始，我是一個有耐心的人。
So go ahead. Get rid of Yezera. Get rid of everyone! And then come back to me, so I can hold you.
所以繼續吧，擺脫葉澤拉，擺脫其他所有人！然後回到我身邊，讓我擁抱你。
Here. Take Jirachi with you. A sign of my undying love, and our divine bond.
不如，帶上基拉祈，這是我永恆的愛和我們之間神聖連結的象徵。
I love you, \PN. My gift to you is a god, because what else could suffice?
我愛你，\PN，送給你一份傳說中的禮物，沒有什麼是比這更好的了。
Take it, and know you’re loved. Loved more than anyone else.
拿上它吧，你將時刻感知到，你被愛著，比以往任何時刻都更多，更充盈的愛。
No? Oh, \PN, you don’t have to leave it with me.
你不打算帶走它？\PN，你沒必要把它留給我。
If it isn’t good enough for you, I’ll make it up to you. Anything you desire, you’ll have. Just let me work out the details, alright?
如果你覺得這份禮物還不夠，我將來會再補償你的，無論你想要什麼我都會給你，讓我來處理這些，好嗎？
You’re gorgeous. You’re perfect beyond words. And you’re mine. All mine.
你的美，無與倫比，而且你是我的，全部都是我的。
So go on. We can be apart for a little while more. I’ll be thinking of you every second you’re away.
現在繼續你的旅程吧，我們可以再分開一段時間，我每一秒都會想念你。
I’ve got preparations to make. Time to set aside, items to procure, people to... obviate.
接下來我要做好一切的準備，安排時間、採購物品、處理麻煩...
We’ll meet again. And then we’ll never meet again, because we’ll never be apart.
等我們再次相遇，就永遠不會再分開，因為...這就是我永恆的愛！
Goodbye, \PN. I love you more than anything in the world.
再見，\PN，我愛你勝過世間一切。
The stone hums with power.
這塊石頭散發出了強大的能量。
Etched into its side are two images, a pair of glowing spheres in red and blue.

You present the Red Orb and the Blue Orb.
你拿出了硃紅色寶珠和靛藍色寶珠。
The stone activates at your touch.
石頭在你觸摸時被激活了。
Are you also here to dance at the top of a mountain?
你也是來在山頂跳舞的嗎？
I regret coming up here dressed like this...
我後悔穿成這樣來這裡了…
I wish Lainie were here to dance with me...
真希望蘭妮能和我一起跳舞…
You won't dance with me? Well, I'm sure you're very fun at parties.
你不想和我跳舞嗎？好吧，或許你對派對更感興趣。
Go on, back to your climbing or whatever you like to do.
繼續去做你喜歡的事情吧。
Do you even have hobbies?
你有什麼愛好嗎？
You’re leaving me? Why?
你要離開我？為什麼？
I was going to create a perfect world for you. Do you know that?
你知道嗎？我本來要創造一個屬於我們的完美世界！
Yezera wants a new world. I don’t care why. It gave me the perfect canvas. An ancient, divine land. A golden age! And this time it’d never end!
葉澤拉想要一個新的世界，我不在乎她的目的，但這給了我一塊完美的畫布，給了我古老而神聖的土地！我可以讓黃金時代永不終結！
I would have her... or you.
我會擁有她...或者你。
I served her whims here, helping her, fighting you, stealing the titans. And I would serve her in the reborn world, love her forever.
我本在那裡為她服務，幫助她與你戰鬥，偷走巨人...在重生的世界裡，我也會繼續為她服務，永遠愛她。
But now that you have shone upon me, I couldn’t ever go back to her. She pales in comparison. So now no one will receive this endless love.
但現在你照亮了我，我再也無法回到她身邊，她現在已經顯得沒那麼美好了...所以現在沒有人能得到我這份無盡的愛。
I will never build a new world for my beloved. And I will never have a god to call mine.
我永遠都無法為我所愛的人創造全新的世界了，我永遠都無法擁有自己的神了。
...Fine. You’ll regret this. They all will.
呵...你會後悔的...你們所有人都會後悔的！
They’ll all die cold and alone, withering unloved and unremembered.
你們都會孤獨地死去，沒有人愛，沒有人記得。
You could’ve been happy. And now the fire smolders to embers and ash. I hope you choke on it.
你本可以很幸福，現在火焰只剩灰燼和餘溫，我只希望它能把你們嗆住！
You – no!
你...不！
Why would you give me hope just to rip it away? Why would you do this to me?
為什麼你要給我希望，然後又將它撕碎？為什麼你要這樣對我？
I have worshiped you! I have loved you! I have always loved you!
我那麼崇敬你，那麼愛你！一直、一直都是這樣！
Gods come to earth, turning their backs on me! Do I deserve this? Have I failed you in a single way?
神明降臨人間，卻背棄了我！難道我不配嗎？我到底是哪裡做錯了？
No! I am pure, and holy! My love is divine!
不！我是純潔而神聖的！我的愛是最神聖的！
Fine then! If you want to cast me into darkness, do so. If my love burns too brightly even for the heavens, cast me down.
既然...連你都想將我扔進黑暗，那就這樣吧...如果連天堂都無法容納我的愛，那就將我驅逐吧...
You can’t stop me. You can’t snuff me out. You’ll be mine eventually. One of the gods will.
但你無法阻止我，無法扼殺我的！你，或者是其他神明中的一個，總有一個，總有一天會是我的！
All I need is one to love forever. One to be mine, and mine alone. I won’t stop until I have one to keep.
我只需要一個永遠愛我的人，一個屬於我...只屬於我的人！我會不停地追求，直到擁有...
I love you. I love you more than anything. And I’ll never see you again.
我愛你，我比誰都更愛你，但我再也見不到你了。
Maybe we’ll meet in another eternity, when I have a god of my own to love and care for. And then we’ll see if you regret this.
也許我們會在另一個永恆中相遇，當我擁有自己的神明去愛和照顧時，到時再看看你是否會後悔吧。
Jirachi seems perturbed. It seems to have gravely misjudged the situation.
基拉祈似乎感到不安，它似乎嚴重地誤判了情況。
It also seems apologetic. Perhaps it wants to make it up to you, or keep you safe.
它也似乎感到很抱歉，也許它也想彌補你受到的傷害，或者保護你免受傷害。
Maybe it’s even attracted by your adamant hopes and wishes.
也許它被你堅定的希望和絕不妥協的願望所吸引。
In any case, it seems willing to be caught by you.
總之，它看起來想跟你走。
How Skyler was blessed by a mythical granter of wishes, you’ll never know.
你無論如何都想不明白，為什麼斯凱勒會被傳說中的願望的象徵祝福。
Jirachi seems highly embarrassed and gladly lets itself be caught. Honestly, it seems like it just wants to forget this ever happened.
基拉祈似乎非常尷尬，但也很高興自己能彌補，其實，它更想就此忘記這件事情。
Jirachi seems disappointed. You suspect it wanted to be caught and battle some more as a palate cleanser.
基拉祈似乎很失望，你懷疑它到底為什麼會祝福斯凱勒，總有種莫名的不安。
As an immortal being, though, it’s got plenty of time to forget this ever happened.
不過，作為一個不朽的存在，它有足夠的時間忘記這件事情。
It leaves with the mountain wind. Perhaps you’ll see it again on these snowy peaks...
它隨著山風離開了，也許你會在這雪山上再次見到它...
The true power of the Dragon-type is only unlocked during an Eclipse!

Fantastic! The Pokemon here will appreciate your kindness!
太棒了！這裡的精靈會感激你的善良！
I don't see enough for a batch, Trainer. Perhaps you are mistaken.

There aren't many Normal-types where I live. The only one I was able to get was a Sentret.
在我的家鄉，一般系的精靈很少，唯一能買到的就是尾立。
Not the Makyan one.
當然不是這裡的那種尾立。
If you want it, I'll trade you a 'mon in the Loyal tribe for it. Want to keep my team cohesive.
如果你想要一隻的話，就拿一隻忠誠之心部族的精靈來交換吧，這樣對我的隊伍也有所幫助（在箱子裡選擇精靈）。
Ah alright, I'll keep looking for one.
好吧，好吧，我會繼續尋找願意交換的訓練家。
Maybe I'll find something in the area west of here.
也許我可以在西邊那片區域找到合適的精靈。
Nice! You won't regret this.
太棒了，你不會後悔的。
Sweet, this little guy is gonna go for an adventure.
我會帶著這個小傢伙一起冒險的。
I hope you enjoy that Sentret, it's pretty rare here.
我希望你能喜歡這隻尾立，畢竟它們在這裡很罕見。
Only authorized personnel are allowed through this door.
只有得到授權的人彩可以進這扇門。
Well, we'd probably let Lainie in.
嗯，蘭妮除外。
She's pretty cool.
因為她很酷！
Huh?
哈？
Didn't my shift end already?
已經過下班時間了？
Something's gone wrong here.
那我還在這裡幹嘛。
How long has it been since I've seen Dolly? Eight years?
我跟多莉已經多久沒見過了？大概...八年？
It’s almost surreal seeing her again. So much has changed...
沒想到還能再見到她，畢竟這時間足以發生太多變化了...
Always make sure to read what you can on open, unlocked computers.
只要有權限閱讀，一定要看完電腦上的所有信息。
You never know what you might find!
不看的話永遠都不知道能得到什麼！
Like credit card information.
比如信用卡相關的信息。
I do research on which types are strong against other types.
我曾對屬性剋制關係做了些研究。
For example, Psychic-type is strong against Steel-type.
比如說超能系可以剋制鋼系。
Most people don't know that!
很多人連這都不知道！
Of course, it's intuitive once you look at how well Alakazam handles its metal spoons!
只要觀察下胡地是怎麼玩勺子的，就能搞懂這個原理了！
You got a key?
你有通行許可嗎？
Understood. Head right on in, trainer.
那你可以進去，訓練家。
You got a key for the lab?
你有實驗室的許可嗎？
If not, we can't let you in.
沒有許可是不能進的。
Grass-types are the best. I love how pure and natural they are.
草屬性是最棒的！我喜歡這種生機盎然的純淨感。
My entire team shrugs off magical attacks like they're nothing!
我的精靈們都能輕鬆抵抗魔法攻擊！
Oh, by "magical" I mean Fairy and Ghost-type.
Oh, by "magical" I mean Fairy and Ghost-type.
Natural beats supernatural any day of the week, in my book.
畢竟，自然的力量總能戰勝那些超自然的東西。
The Fossil Research Lab has so many fossils that we're just giving them away!
化石研究所裡積累的化石太多了，所以我們經常會送出去一些！
You can pay to get your fossils revived, too.
你也可以使用化石復活技術。
Talk to my associate in the room to our left.
去左邊房間裡找我的助手就可以了。
Oh, Dolly! I thought I’d never see you again!
多莉！我還以為再也見不到你了！
And you -- I can’t thank you enough for getting her back to me. How’d you find her?
真的...非常感謝你，能讓她再回到我身邊。你是怎麼找到她的？
Oh, uh... well, don’t worry about that.
呃...那不重要。
Anyways, uh, gotta see a man about a Poochyena. Toodles!
或許是靠土狼犬的鼻子呢？總之，再見！
Umph!
誒！
It’s you! Uh...
是你！呃...
Well, I mean, like, technically yeah.
嗯，我是說...大概...技術層面上來講沒錯。
But they stole them first! Team Chasm needs to pay back its dues, y’hear me? They stole those Pokémon years ago!
但是是他們先偷走的了！裂隙隊需要為他們的所作所為負責！你應該知道吧，這些精靈是他們幾年前偷走的！
Yeah, you got it!
沒錯，看來你知道內情！
I, like, totally can’t stand the idea of some ex-Team Chasm jerks keeping some Pokémon that prolly still wants to go back home.
我...大概...完全不能接受前裂隙隊的成員，強行保留那些想要回家的精靈。
I, uh, guess I maybe kinda should’ve explained that earlier.
我...呃...我應該早點解釋清楚的。
But, like, hey, no harm no foul, right? My name’s <imp>Candy</imp>.
但是，大概...嘿嘿，應該沒關係吧？我是<imp>糖兒</imp>。
And you’re \PN -- I know, like, everything about you. So, hey, you’re cool. You, uh, want to team up?
我知道你是\PN - 我聽說過你的...大概...一切！所以，你，很酷！你願意跟我合作嗎？
Yeaaah, damn straight. Finally got a friend my age. Go Candy!
耶！！！大成功！終於找到一個年齡相仿的朋友了！加油吧，糖兒！
Anyways, I’ll 100% be in touch. So we can inflict some more justice.
總之，我之後100%會跟你聯繫的，這樣我們就能一起為正義而奮鬥了。
Sayonara!
再見咯！
Oof. Rejected hard.
哦...被決絕了。
Welp, that’s your loss! Hell, if you keep working with Tamarind and Andris, I might just be your next rival!
行吧，這是你的損失！哼，如果你繼續跟塔瑪琳或安德里斯他們合作，我就會成為你的下一個對手！
Watch your back!
小心你的腦袋！
Premise 1: Ice both resists and is super-effective against Ground.
知識點1：冰屬性不僅對地面屬性強力，還有很強的抵禦其攻擊的抗性。
Premise 2: Rock both resists and is super-effective against Ice.
知識點2：岩石屬性不僅剋制冰屬性，還可以抵抗冰屬性的傷害。
Final premise: Ground is super-effective against Rock.
知識點3：地面屬性可以剋制岩石屬性。
Conclusion: To maintain consistency, Ground must resist Rock!
結論：為了保持均衡，地面屬性就得抵抗岩石才對！
The world is just perfectly balanced, isn't it?
真是令人愉悅的均衡，不是嗎？
Now I just need to figure out what's going on with Psychic...
現在我只需要再搞明白超能的話...
The door reads "Authorized personnel only!"
上面寫著“無授權不得進入！”
Welcome to Novo College!
歡迎來到望新大學！
Feel free to check out any of our labs and classrooms to learn what kind of place we are.
我們的教室和實驗室，在正常情況下完全對外開放，您可以隨意參觀。
You can also log onto the PC over there to read lots about our history, our majors, and other stuff.
如果您想了解我們的歷史、研究、錄取信息等內容，可以移步一旁的電腦進行查看。
Dolly here got, uh, reappropriated by Team Chasm... how long has it been? Eight years?
自多莉被裂隙隊強徵到現在...已經...七八年了吧？
It’s almost surreal seeing her again.
沒想到還能再見到她。
Welcome to the Novo College Informational Site! Please select one of the following subjects to learn more!
歡迎來到望新大學信息站！請選擇您要瀏覽的信息內容！
Makyan paleontology is in an exciting time. Recent excursions have promised field-shaking discoveries.
目前，馬凱亞的古生物研究正處於一個關鍵階段，一些近期的發現甚至會顛覆學界的普遍認知。
The avatar crisis has only existed for less than half a year, but already fossil analysis has found striking resemblances to ancient Pokemon.
在化身出現的不到半年時間中，根據現在已經掌握的證據和資料，發現其與古代精靈之間有著許多驚人的相似之處。
Skeletons found by researchers are significantly larger than the bone structure of modern counterparts.
其骨骼形態和規模，明顯比現代生物更龐大。
Novo College has an accoladed history in the material sciences.
望新大學在材料科學研究上有著悠久的歷史。
The Rematerializer was voted by Trainers as one of the most useful inventions in the last decade.
我們發明的重塑打印機被訓練家們評選為過去十年中最有用的發明之一。
We also work closely with Pokemon Centers in order to improve medicinal practices.
同時我們還在積極尋求與精靈中的合作，來改善各地的醫療設施。
Makya has a stunningly biodiverse ecosystem, which has raised the mystery of how it got to that point.
馬凱亞地區生態系統的多樣性，一直是各地學者重點研究的課題。
One theory is that immigration to the region has brought stowaway Pokemon, or foreign Pokemon released into the wild.
部分學者認為，是外來移民帶來了本不屬於這裡的精靈，並因各種原因將其釋放到野外。
Another theory is the Makyan environmental policy is particularly effective.
另一部分學者認為，是馬凱亞地區出色的生態治理，使得更多生命可以在此繁衍。
For both theories, the counterargument is that fossil records show that Makya has had this biodiversity before human settlements were even founded.
但根據古生物研究，早在有人類定居之前，馬凱亞地區的生物種群數量就已經達到了一個很高的數值。
In collaboration with Eko, Novo Town's Gym Leader, Novo College is developing new pain-relief medication for Pokemon.
與諾沃鎮的道館館主Eko合作，諾沃學院正在開發新的精靈止痛藥。
While status-relieving medicine serves a purpose, its main flaw is that it is reactive rather than proactive.
目前市面上的狀態類藥物，雖也有一定的止痛效果，但一直無法解決不能由精靈自主使用的缺點。
As a response to this issue, the College has been working to develop a new ointment, which can be applied to Pokemon once a day.
為了繞開自主使用的難題，本院校正在努力開發新型藥膏，
Unlike existing medicines, it serves to stop status pains before they happen.
與現有藥物不同，我們希望新的藥品，能在疼痛出現之前便阻斷神經元對痛感的反應。
Pokemon in the midst of battle will still feel the effects, long-term pain will be numbed a few minutes after combat.
在對戰中的精靈仍然會受到突然刺激型痛感的影響，但可以免除持續型痛感的影響。
Career battling Pokemon benefit most from this, as continued exposure to untreated status can result in chronic pains once the Pokemon retires from battling.
這種藥物適用於職業對戰精靈，如果對其濫用，導致長時間處於藥物作用狀態，很可能會使其患上慢性疼痛。
The avatar crisis has disrupted much of Makya's already strained infrastructure, as travel between settlements has become quite dangerous.
化身的出現極大影響了本就不夠發達的馬凱亞基礎設施，城際間的聯絡也會因此變得危險。
To help combat this, Novo College has been offering free courses to Trainers and Rangers who wish to keep Makyan routes safe.
為了暫時緩解這些問題，望新大學一直在為負責線路安全工作的訓練家和義軍提供免費課程。
Multiple professors and students work to develop new strategies to defeat these avatars.
目前有多位教授和學生，正在研究有效對付化身的技巧。
Experienced Trainers with a history of battling avatars are encouraged to volunteer in educational roles.
我們呼籲社會各界有化身對戰經驗的訓練家能夠自願參與此項目。
One of the College's latest projects involved tracking genetic signatures in the Golett, Baltoy, and Castform families.
我校最近開設了新的項目，人為干預哥達鴨、天秤偶和漂浮泡泡的家族基因序列。
While the exact methods of reproduction elude scientists, many suspect that selection forces remain at play.
目前參與的學者們，還在對測試用的繁育方法進行商討，且其具體可行性仍受到質疑。
How this natural selection impacts man-made Pokemon could have remarkable insights on how other Pokemon change form over millennia.
我們無法確定自然選擇是否會干擾到人造精靈的形成。
Applications for the current school year are closed.
入學申請入口暫已關閉。
Acceptance letters will be sent out shortly.
錄取通知將很快送達。
LuxTech Scholars will be contacted by a representative on their first week of classes.
來自光華市的學生將會在開學一週之內得到通知。
Greetings. I hope you’ve come prepared to answer a few questions.
你好，我能問你幾個問題嗎？
Thank you. I would like a firsthand account.
謝謝，這對我的調查很有幫助。
Concerning the avatars and their effects.
一些關於化身的問題。
No, but I would appreciate it.
當然不是，我只是在做一個調查。
Understandable. I require more data, however.
我只是希望您能參與調查...
Upon more elaborate consideration, I decided to not have you present our findings with me.
這樣吧，我不做過多的講述了，只是問幾個最簡單的問題如何？
I think you’ll be glad to hear that. I would like to hear your personal opinions, though.
畢竟每一位受訪者，對我來說都是寶貴的數據。
Could you give me an estimate of how many avatars you have fought during your time in Makya?
你能告訴我在馬凱亞，一共解決掉多少化身了嗎？
Significantly more encounters than the average individual, certainly.
那至少比一般人見得多。
That many? Noted.
這麼多？
I have my own estimates based on public records and hearsay. I will default to those.
那我就根據公共數據大致估測一下吧。
Do you take no thrill in defeating these beings? Unfortunately I fear you may be an expert in the matter.
你是不是已經覺得它們沒什麼挑戰性了？聽起來你比我想象中經驗更為豐富。
So, have you noticed any common traits between avatars?
那你有沒有發現它們身上的什麼特質？
As the local people have found out.
大家都這麼說。
I will trust your judgment, as an experienced battler.
一個經驗豐富的戰士都這麼說，那這個結論的可靠程度會很高。
Ah, yes. I’ve heard of this phenomenon.
啊，對，我也聽說過這個事。
I have my suspicions that the true nature of the avatars and Makya’s unique properties share a common origin.
我一直懷疑化身和馬凱亞的特有地區形態有同根同源的關係。
The unique ecological pressures that create the Makyan forms must stem from the same source as the avatars. I’m certain of it.
或許迫使它們進化的生存壓力，便來源於這些化身。
This region has several pockets of blatantly unnatural climatology – its immense cave network chief among them.
要知道這裡有些地方的氣候明顯不自然，尤其是那些地下洞穴中。
There is more to this region than I have discovered thus far.
想必這片土地上，還有更多人類未曾發現的祕密。
...But, excuse me. I am not asking questions. I am talking your ear off.
而且...呃...抱歉。這已經不是在做調查了，只是沒忍住說多了而已。
I need to collect my findings to present to the local experts in regional forms and the ranger captains.
我必須整理好情報和推論，並將其交給教授和義軍軍官看看。
I would like to talk with you again. Do you know the <imp>menagerie in Velenz</imp>?
我覺得我們可以展開深度合作。你知道 <imp>夜幽市生態園</imp> 嗎？
I would suggest we meet there.
我們在那裡見吧。
Though, considering the timing, it would perhaps be better to wait until after the tournament is over. That way at least one burden will be off your mind.
不過，考慮到時間問題...或許可以等到聯盟大會結束之後，這樣不至於耽誤你自己的事情。
In fact, if it may help you in achieving a quick victory, take these.
為了幫你快速取勝，這個就給你了。
Best of luck. Goodbye, \PN.
祝你好運，再見，\PN。
Our college isn't too grand, but we have three ace areas.
這所大學雖然不算頂尖，但卻有三個王牌專業。
Paleontology, 3D printing, and electronics.
古生物考古，3D打印，以及電子科技。
When you combine them, you get the largest fossil studies and revival program in the world!
試想一下，如果將這三者結合起來，就會產生世界上最大的化石研究和復興項目！

Grouz Station Captain, at your service.
你好，我是古治站站長。
Don't know why nobody stopped you at the cave mouth, but I guess that's all you can expect from grunts.
雖然不知道為什麼沒人攔住你，但我也並不因此感到奇怪。
Unless you got a proper ID card, we're not gonna let you through.
除非你有正式的身份卡，否則我們不會讓你通過。
Too many would-be heroes have gotten themselves hurt fighting the Avatar in there...
我們見過太多自稱為英雄的人，在裡面被化身打成重傷了...
How'd you get your hands on a Chasm ID Card?
你怎麼會有裂隙隊的身份卡？
Don't tell me you stole that thing just to fight these Avatars.
別告訴我你是為了跟化身戰鬥，才去偷身份卡的。
Not sure if that's brave or just stupid.
真不知道該說你勇敢還是愚蠢。
Due to policy, I've got to let you through regardless of how I feel. Ridiculous, I know.
呵，出於政策，無論我怎麼想，都得讓你通過，真是荒謬。
Hah! If a single Ranger here had half of your grit I'd never have worry about anything.
哈哈！如果這裡的義軍有你一半的勇氣和實力，我就不需要再操這麼多心了。
Since we let you through to fight the Avatar, how about you keep quiet about beating it?
出於我們讓你通過的交換，請你暫時不要告訴外界，這裡的化身已經被打敗了，好嗎？
They won't notice for a few days at least.
這樣，應該能拖幾天的時間。
Allow me and my team a well deserved vacation.
足夠讓士兵們休息休息了。
This assignment sucks...
這任務糟透了...
You get yourself a few badges as a hobby and all of a sudden they say you're getting drafted into this mess...
我本來只是處於愛好去挑戰了幾個道館，然後就突然被徵召進義軍了...
I could see all those flashy moves from back here...
從這裡我都能看到那些花哨的招數…
Almost caught a stray shot!
還差點被流彈擊中！
A right proper mess this is.
真是糟了個大糕！
None of us are getting paid enough for throwing our Pokemon at this Suicune over and over.
我們拿到的那一點工資，根本抵不上在這裡跟水君玩命對戰的工作量。
Can't even remember the last time I got more than five hours of sleep...
上一次一覺超過五小時已經是多久之前的事情了...
Need me a right proper bonus after this.
我需要一筆豐厚的獎金作為報酬！
Mans needs a full night of sleep as well.
我還需要睡一個好覺！
[Map125]
Whoa, careful kid. Ain't no adventure for you past here 'less you know what'cha doin'.
哇，注意安全，孩子！你知道這裡是什麼地方嗎？
Can't let'cha through 'less you got the proper clearance.
除非你有許可，否則不能通過。
That gate ain't opening for any ol' Trainer that wanders in.
我們不會允許冒然闖進來的訓練家通過那扇門的。
I ain't gon' stop you since you got yerself the proper clearance.
既然你有通行證，那我就可以讓你過去了。
Ain't gon' like it, since you're just gonna get your behind handed to ya.
雖說我自己不願這麼做，畢竟你也只會被打敗。
We'll I'll be darned! You took it down!
我驚了！你打贏了！
Yer good in my books kid. Ain't seen battlin' like that since my days as a grunt.
你乾得很漂亮，孩子！自我從軍以來，就沒見過這樣的戰鬥了！
The Svait Rescue Op owes ya one. I'm glad this crisis is a bit closer to bein' over.
霜皚救援隊欠你一個人情，離結束這場危機更近一步了！
Alright y'all, time to get outta here!
好了各位，可以回家了！
You think you can best that monster? Best of luck.
你覺得你能打敗那個怪物？那就祝你好運吧。
Takes 3 of us to just keep it from escaping...
每次阻止它跑出去，都需要我們三個人合力才行...
When you challenged that Avatar, I thought you just had as much pride as a Pyroar.
之前你要挑戰這個化身時，我以為你只是個跟火炎獅一樣自大的傢伙。
But wow, you've got the skills to justify it.
但是你證明了的確有這份實力。
If everyone in Makya was as good as you, the Avatar Crisis would be an Avatar Inconvenience.
如果馬凱亞能多一些像你這樣優秀的人，化身帶來的危機就是小問題了。
All I wanted was to attend the Makyan championships!
我只是來馬凱亞參加競技大會的！
How'd I even get involved with the Avatar of Entei of all things?
為什麼會被捲入炎帝化身的防務工作當中啊？
I go to boarding school in Paldea and Team Star ropes me into their plans...
我一開始在帕底亞上學，然後莫名其妙加入了天星隊...
I go to Galar and end up on a Team Yell cheer squad...
後來去了伽勒爾，又在旅店被吶喊隊選中...
I got to Alola and I'm working for every famous evil dude under the sun?!
在之後去了阿羅拉，又無意之中幫某個邪惡老大幹了不少髒活...
And now this?! I need to rethink how I travel...
為什麼現在又是這種感覺？我是不是該改改自己的旅行習慣...
[Map126]
Stand ho! We have gathered here to appraiseth a bundle of treasures most wondrous!
站住！我們正在評估寶物的價值！
Longeth has't we taken to accrue this, and thee shall findeth it prudent to leaveth us to our work!
這是我們長久努力的回報，請你不要自討沒趣！
UNLESS!
難道...
Un. Less.
難道！
Thee dareth challenge us, for stake over such a wond'rous horde?!
你想要獨吞這些寶藏？想要挑戰我們？
Staking a claim on this? That'd be a mis-stake if you ask me!
真是個愚蠢的決定！
Quite indeed, mine own comedic companion!
沒錯，我的搭檔！
Say, Great Sage Rennyo, doth thee knoweth this person who hast happened upon us?
偉大又神聖的雷尼奧，你認識這個突然出現的人嗎？
I see.
我明白了。
Well, what shalt thee doth anon stranger?
好吧，陌生人，我想結果應該不會有什麼變化。
Shall thee square us in a Pokemon battleth most enjoyable? Or shall thee cower before our combined might...
你要和我們進行一場最有趣的精靈戰鬥嗎？還是在我們的聯合面前退縮…
Fare thee well then, stranger. We shalt stayeth here and do our work, until a true challenger comes.
那好吧，陌生人，我們會繼續待在這裡，等待真正的挑戰者。
Very well! Approach, stranger!
好的，那就來吧！
Bested at last!
終於被打敗了！
Never before hast we set our eyes upon so great a champion as you.
我們從未見過你這樣偉大的人！
Yeah, we really got whalloped for our wares!
我們為自己的貪婪付出了代價！
Truer word have ne'er been spoken!
就是這樣！
We best be taking our leave.
我們該走了。
Exeunt!
謝幕！
A voice rings out from further into the cave.
山洞深處傳來了吵鬧聲。
Lo! We hast finally found the treasure we hast been seeking!
我們終於找到這個寶藏了！
A heavy crate. Its front side lock has been broken off.
一個沉重的板條箱，鎖頭已經被保利拆解掉了。
There are items inside!
裡面好像有些東西！
No
不
Yes
是
[Map127]
Stat changes affect Avatars, sure, but they have the ability to remove the negative changes somehow.
降低能力的技能對化身也有用，但效果不如一般精靈明顯。
Perhaps stat-changing moves are more common wherever they come from.
也許這種變化類技能對他們來說，只不過是平常的開胃小菜？
Among the garbage, you see what remains of a MasterBall, crushed completely flat.
垃圾桶裡，有一個被壓成球片兒的大師球...
I'd rather you not interrupt my lecture.
請不要打擾我講課。
This information about avatars could save lives.
這些關於化身的知識點，或許就能挽救某人的生命。
I tried to face an Ursaring avatar up in the Split Peaks.
我曾在嵌口峰面對過圈圈熊化身。
I thought I'd be clever and use my Sinistea and my Duskull to completely negate its attacks.
我當時耍了點小聰明，試圖用來悲茶和夜巡靈免疫攻擊。
I learned the hard way that avatars can ignore immunities. With their Empowered moves, at least.
然後我就學到了化身無視免疫這個重要知識點，起碼它們強化後的技能如此。
The damage was enough to send me packing. Later that day I heard that Victoire was able to take it down.
然後我就灰溜溜地逃走了，直到晚些時候，聽說最後是薇克特爾擊敗了它。
I bet that battle was a real carnival!
那一定是一場令人熱血沸騰的激戰！
If an avatar takes enough damage, it might retaliate with a special kind of move.
當一個化身受到足夠多的傷害後，就會使用一種極其特殊的技能。
Not only is the move powerful, it changes the typing of the avatar itself!
這種技能擁有強大的威力，能夠幫助它們恢復傷勢，還可以改變它們自身的屬性！
Make sure your team isn't caught off guard by a sudden matchup reversal.
挑戰化身時一定要考慮好，自己的精靈是否有完全處理不了的屬性變化。
Most Pokemon are only able to have one status problem at a time.
大多數精靈同時只會陷入一種異常狀態。
Avatars, on the other hand, have no such defenses.
但是，化身並不在此列。
You can have an avatar that's burned and numbed simultaneously!
你可以讓一個化身同時被麻痺和燒傷。
It's strange to consider what biological differences might have caused this discrepancy.
想想是什麼生物差異導致了這種差異，真是奇怪。
A ranger buddy of mine told me about the Avatars of Entei, Raikou, and Suicune.
我有個義軍朋友跟我說，他曾面對過炎帝、雷皇和水君的化身。
He fought them, but won't tell me where at, the coward.
但是他沒告訴我這些化身在哪兒，誰知道是不是在吹牛。
Though, maybe he's right to not get others involved.
不過話說回來，如果是真的，為了不牽扯進他人而保密也可以理解。
He's got three badges, and even then he failed to make a dent.
但我還是覺得他在吹牛，他也不過只拿到了三枚徽章而已。
During my field studies, I noticed that the avatars rarely attacked the same Pokemon over and over.
通過對數據的研究，我發現化身很少連續攻擊同一只精靈。
They seemed to have a regular rhythm of switching who they were being aggressive against.
它們似乎在按照一種固定的節奏，切換它們攻擊的對象。
Holding back to avoid being too lethal? Or something else?
難不成是良心發現不想下死手？誰知道呢！
The board is scribbled with field research notes about an Avatar of Vileplume.
黑板上詳細地寫著霸王花化身的詳細資料。
Apparently a lot of stinky flowers bloomed nearby after it appeared. Gross!
在它出現之後，附近開出了很多散發著臭味的花！
[Map128]
Accessorize! Every Pokémon NEEDS an item!
裝飾起來！每隻精靈都需要一個物品！
If you can’t decide, give them Leftovers or a shiny new Gem and watch them strut their stuff.
如果你拿不定主意，給它們剩飯或閃亮的新寶石，然後看它們大顯身手。
There are dozens and dozens of items to pick from, so I’m sure you can find something to match your Pokémon!
有幾十種物品可供選擇，我相信你能找到適合你精靈的東西！
Setting up with something like Dragon Dance can turn a Pokémon into an unstoppable juggernaut.
用龍舞之類的技能強化，可以把精靈變成不可阻擋的巨獸。
But be patient. Pick the right time and place.
但要耐心。選對時機和地點。
Wait for something you can set up on without being humbled, and make sure there’s no nasty surprises waiting in the wings.
等到你能安全強化的機會，並確保沒有意外的威脅在等著你。
Remember to check the Info tab in battle.
記得在戰鬥中查看信息欄。
That’ll give you the nitty-gritty on your opponent’s stats – or yours.
它會告訴你對手（或你自己）的詳細數據。
You can also check the MasterDex to see what kinds of moves your opponent learns.
你也可以查看MasterDex，瞭解對手可能學會的技能。
Otherwise you might find out something learns Ice Shard the hard way.
否則，你可能會在吃虧後才發現對手會冰礫。
And, hey, you can use it after the fight to find potential team members. Just filter and search.
而且，嘿，你可以在戰鬥後用MasterDex尋找潛在的隊伍成員。只需篩選和搜索。
Hello again, champion.
又見面了，冠軍。
Don't pay me any mind.
別管我。
I'm just here to discuss some possible changes to the monument with Jovan.
我只是來和Jovan討論紀念碑的一些可能的改動。
You've met, I believe?
你們見過，對吧？
I'll take your Pokémon for a few seconds.
請允許我暫時拿走您的精靈。
First, you should restore your Pokémon to full health.
現在你的精靈已經恢復活力了。
We hope you excel!
祝您一路順風！
Offensive Pokémon need offensive moves.
攻擊型精靈需要攻擊技能。
Most of the time you’ve got more moves than types.
大多數時候，你的技能比屬性多。
That means you’re going to want some attacking moves that complement the moves that match your types.
這意味著你需要一些攻擊技能來補充與屬性匹配的技能。
Think long and hard about those.
仔細考慮這些。
A Normal-type might want a Dark or Ground move.
普通系精靈可能會想要惡系或地面系技能。
If your team’s weak to Ice, maybe here’s where you slip in a Mach Punch or a Flamethrower.
如果你的隊伍弱冰，也許可以在這裡加入音速拳或噴射火焰。
Think about it.
好好想想。
Heyo, \PN. Want some guaranteed one-hundred- percent success rate advice?
嘿，\PN。想要一些百分百成功的建議嗎？
Never be afraid to bring, like, five Pokémon that all do the same thing.
別害怕帶上五隻功能相同的精靈。
They can’t counter all of them.
他們不可能全部防住。
No, but seriously, doubling or tripling or quadrupling down can overwhelm your opponent’s answers.
不，說真的，雙倍、三倍甚至四倍的投入可以壓倒對手的應對手段。
How many Water resists can they really have?
他們真的能有那麼多抗水的精靈嗎？
And, hey, if you’ve got a spare team slot, bring something hyper-focused on countering what counters you.
而且，如果你有空餘的隊伍位置，帶一些專門針對你弱點的精靈。
Aww. Well, at least read what I’ve written. It’s up on one of the computers.
啊，好吧，至少讀讀我寫的東西。它在一臺電腦上。
\PN! Nice to see you.
\PN！能見到你真好。
I mean, you're the champion, now, so I suppose its only natural that you'd try take on the Battle Monument.
我是說，你現在是冠軍了，所以我理所當然的希望你能來參加戰鬥紀念塔的挑戰。
I did some consulting work on the trainer AI, so I'm very aware that its quite a challenge.
我之前做過訓練家AI的諮詢工作，所以我知道這有多難。
Good luck!
祝你好運！
Champion. Good seeing you.
冠軍，很高興見到你。
Do you need some advice?
你需要一些建議嗎？
Take a second draft. Running your team into the Monument without hours of research can feel like feeding them into a meat grinder.
再考慮一下。不經過充分研究就把隊伍帶進紀念碑，感覺就像把它們送進絞肉機。
But don’t discount the value of practice and iteration.
但不要忽視練習和調整的價值。
Take note of what you couldn’t answer.
記下你無法應對的情況。
Even swapping out a few moves or items can make a night-and-day difference.
即使只是更換幾個技能或物品，也能帶來天壤之別。
Even the most hopeless of teams can be honed into something usable with enough work.
即使是最無望的隊伍，經過足夠的努力也能變得可用。
Good to hear! I’ll refrain from wishing you good luck, then.
很高興聽你這麼說！那我就不祝你好運了。
If said luck does begin to turn, though, I encourage you to read my guide.
但如果運氣真的開始變差，我建議你讀讀我的指南。
It’s up on one of the computers.
它在一臺電腦上。
Sure?
確定嗎？
No thanks.
不了，謝謝。
Yeah.
是的。
Not really.
不太需要。

行吧，就當幫我個忙，別去直接找佐伊，這會極大影響她的情緒。
Wait, you – you think you’re as good as she was, huh?
你不會跟她一樣自負吧？
Zoé! Get your ass over here! We’ve got a challenger to put in the DIRT!
佐伊，趕緊滾過來！有挑戰者來了！
Aw, I knew you’d be a good sport about it.

I was trained by the best. Lemme show you.
現在就讓我給你看看，我所受過的最好的訓練，所帶來的成果吧！

But, yeah, alright. I’ll run support for you if you’re gonna give me such an arrogant target. You ain’t her, kid.

*hiss* A challenger?

Ignore the poser and let’s cut to the chase: this is gonna be a double battle. Us two versus you.

Don’t ask why; it’s complicated and don’t change the facts.
不要問為什麼，很複雜，而且這個事實也改變不了。
You want the badge. I want to style on someone.
你，想要得到徽章，我，想要在某人面前炫耀一下。
And because of… circumstances… we’ve got to include the clout chaser in the mix.
由於…一些不可抗力…我們還得讓那個傢伙加入進來。
So, you down? Think you’re tough enough to take on me and Bence at the same time?
所以，你有什麼打算？你覺得能同時對付我和本斯嗎？
*hiss* Fine. You’ll be back soon enough.

Y-you will be back, right?
你會回來的，對吧？
*hiss* You remind me of a girl I once knew. You ain’t her.

I’d tell you to stop pretending, but how ‘bout Bence and I just teach an object lesson, huh?

We don’t agree on much, but if you think you’re like our teacher, we’re gonna humble you REAL fast.

Humility isn’t my strong suit, but I’m not stupid. Least, not as stupid as Bence thinks I am.
謙虛不是我的風格，但這不代表我很自大，至少，我不像本斯那麼蠢。
*hiss* Damn.
*嘶嘶聲* 該死。
Well, you won. Flying colors. A+ grade.
好吧，你贏了。非常出色，A+等級。
Always good to see someone that can keep pace with me. And isn’t as smug about it as Bence.
我其實很高興看到有人能跟上我的步伐，而且沒有本斯那麼自大。
Take our badge.
拿走我們的徽章。
And since a little bird told me you’ve got friends in high places, put in a good word for me, eh?
而且有隻小鳥告訴我你認識高層人物，能替我說句好話嗎？
*hiss* Bence is too much of a square to get involved with anything illegal.
*嘶嘶聲* 本斯太過老實，對很多事情缺少變通。
And this is. Probably.
而這個，很可能...
Our mentor walked out one day out of the blue. Left us to manage the gym.

Do it.
來吧。

One’s from Bence, saying that he’s going to go on a journey of self-discovery better than hers.
第一封是本斯寫的，說他要踏上一場比她更好的自我實現之旅。
Another is from a perfume company inquiring about hiring her for Ceruledge-themed advertisements.
第二封是一家香水公司的，想要邀請她拍攝一段以蒼炎刃鬼為主題的廣告。
The third is her sending pictures of Ceruledge to several people, asking if they knew about the Pokémon. She seems extremely impressed by it.
第三封是她發給別人的郵件，詢問朋友們蒼炎刃鬼是什麼精靈，看來她對此很上心。
Yo, champ in the making!
喲，未來的冠軍！
We have two Gym Leaders here on the West side of Prizca.
西宏禮道館有兩個館主。
Bence and Zoé are Rock-type and Flying-type users.
那就是使用岩石和飛行系的本斯和佐伊。
There isn't a magic typing here that I could recommend you. These types are a pretty good combo.
在這裡並沒有什麼特別好的屬性可以推薦給你，因為這個組合相當給力。
Steel might be your best bet.
相對來講最好的選擇應該是鋼。
Water and Rock are a close second.
再就是水和岩石。
There are two paths that each challenger can take, though you can switch between them whenever.
每位挑戰者都可以選擇任意一條路線進行挑戰，當然你也可以隨時換一條路。
Try to pick and choose which Trainers are the easiest for you to take down.
儘量選擇對你來說更簡單的把。
Nice one, you took 'em down!
幹得好，你把他們打敗了
Keep at it and you'll go far.
繼續努力，你會走得更遠。
I'm not a full time Trainer, I just work here.
我不是全職訓練家，我只是來上班的。
I thought I'd try a hand at battlin', but I guess I need to be a bit better.
我覺得我可以試試參加對戰，但必須得更強一些。
Oooh that was fun, maybe I'll do that again.
哦，真有意思，我想再來一場了。
I really just work here...
我的確是來上班的...
Welcome to West Prizca's Gym, how tough are ya?
歡迎來到西宏禮道館，那麼，你有多強呢？
Go right ahead.
請進。
Yeah, so what if you beat me?
你就算贏了又如何？
How tough am I?
我到底有多強？
Good question kid.
好問題，孩子。
*hiss* So that’s that. Bit of a mess.
*嘶嘶聲* 就這樣吧，有點亂。
But you’ve got a real knack for handling chaos, huh? You remind me of… whatever.
但你真的很擅長處理混亂，沒錯吧？你讓我想起了...唉...不重要。
Zoé! Show some respect to the future champion, huh?
佐伊，對未來的冠軍尊重一些，好嗎？
Take the badge, my friend: you’ve earned it.
拿著這個徽章：你贏得了它。
You were UNTOUCHABLE; just incredible!
你是無敵的！
And Zoé’s wrong. We don’t need to watch you.
另外，別聽佐伊說的，我們不是要盯著你。
You’re the one we were told to find.
而是因為，你就是我們要找的人。
Uh, as much as I hate to say it, I’ve gotta let Zoé take care of this one. She knows what to say.
嗯，儘管我不想這麼說，但我得讓佐伊繼續處理，她知道該接下來是什麼。
Not right now.
稍等
Hell yeah.
來吧
Give me a sec.
等一下
Yeah, I do.
來吧

My family has trained here for generations.
我們家族幾代人都在這裡訓練。
I've seen a few like you in my life. Always a thrilling experience to fight.
我之前見過像你這樣的人，和你們戰鬥真是刺激的經歷。
This place always always seems to draw in those on great journeys. I take advantage of that to watch history first-hand.
這裡總是吸引著那些踏上偉大旅程的人，我也在利用這個機會親眼見證歷史。
I have had the pleasure of battling every champion in this region.
我曾經有幸與這個地區的每一位冠軍戰鬥過。
I've lost everytime, but each is an unforgettable learning experience.
雖然我每次都輸了，但都是難忘的學習經歷。
They say each drop of light carries a memory of triumph.
他們說泛著光的水滴中攜帶著勝利的記憶。
Memories adrift, floating dreams. An aspiration fulfilled, yet peace sickens them. Do you find yourself here?
飄搖的記憶，浮動的夢想，當願望實現了，那份平靜，反而讓人們感到噁心。那你在這裡找到本我了嗎？
Perhaps your victories will end up here, one day.
你的勝利終有一天會在這裡結束。
Spend enough time here and it begins to feel like a forum.
在這裡待的時間足夠久後，就越來越覺得它像個祭壇。

Oh, I'd introduce you to her, but she's enjoying herself at Bluepoint Beach at the moment.
她現在去藍瑩海灘享受陽光了，回頭我可以向你介紹她。
Lambert's House
蘭伯特家
Hey, kiddo. What’s goin’ on? I heard you’re following me.
喲，小鬼，咋回事？聽說我後面有個跟屁蟲啊！
Well, go right ahead. Not gonna get a Beedrill in my bonnet over some kid toddling after me.
當然，我肯定不在意，你愛咋咋地。
By the time you find me, I’ll be Champion, and mom will have her mind made up.
不過等你追上我的時候，我肯定已經是冠軍了，別到時候在媽媽面前哭鼻子哦！
Yeah, sure, make it sound like a real competition.
好，好，這才有競爭的樣子。
What? Persian got your tongue? Whatever -- I didn’t call to hear you talk.
咋了？無話可說了？隨便吧，反正我也不是為了聽你說什麼廢話才打電話的，
Tsk, tsk. Feisty little runt.
哦，炸毛了？
You’re at the gym in that villa, right? Real gaudy place. I remember the gym -- want some advice?
你應該在那個俗氣的破島上對吧？該挑戰那個道館對吧？需要我給你一些建議嗎？
Too bad. If you can’t beat that gym, you don’t deserve to even be in this competition. Bye!
菜就多練，連那個道館都打不過，還妄圖能超過我？再見！
You’ve always needed my help. Fine -- prove me wrong. We’ll talk again.
哼，早晚你會發現，沒有了我的幫助你什麼都做不到，爭取一會兒不要哭著求我喲！
I've summered here for 20 years.
我已經在這兒度過了20個夏天。
I must say it really went to the dogs once Team Chasm started moving in.
從裂隙隊接管這裡開始，真是一年不如一年。
I especially don't like the gym leader they stationed here.
尤其是他們派來的那個道館館主！
Before all this, he was a bartender at some establishment for roustabouts.
要知道他之前可是個流浪漢酒吧的調酒師！
"Casaba Villa, Makya's #1 Vacation Spot"
"歡迎來到在馬凱亞地區遙遙領先的--甜瓜度假村"
I volunteer at the PokeCenter here sometimes.
我有時會在這裡的精靈中心當志願者。
So many trainers come in with Numbed Pokemon after battling Lambert.
有很多訓練家都會在跟蘭伯特對戰後，帶著被麻痺的精靈前來求助。
Apparently a lot of new trainers struggle with that status, as it halves the Pokemon's speed and reduces the damage they do.
很多新手訓練家都對這種異常狀態非常苦惱，因為它不僅會讓精靈的速度減半，還會降低所造成的傷害。
Greetings!
您好！
If appearances are to be believed, you seem to be a fine trainer.
如果我沒看走眼，你一定是一位不錯的訓練家。
I'll be challenging the gym here soon, but need a bit more practice with this team in particular.
我正在為挑戰這裡的道館做準備，但我的精靈還需要一些實戰訓練。
After all, my goal is to defeat the leader without any of my Pokemon fainting.
畢竟，我的目標是取得完勝，也就是在沒有任何精靈昏倒的前提下擊敗道館館主！
Therefore, I'd like to battle you, if you have the time.
所以，如果你有時間的話，我希望能跟你一起訓練！
Call me <imp>Vanya</imp>.
你可以叫我<imp>凡雅</imp>，
Know that I am unique among trainers.
一個獨一無二非常優秀的訓練家！
In my quest for perfect victories, I have suffered perfect defeats as well.
雖然在追求完勝的過程中，我也曾遭受過完敗，
Near everyone runs off after a bad loss, but not I.
但我不會像一般人那樣落荒而逃！
You can <imp>perfect</imp> my team all you want, and I'll <imp>stay right here</imp>.
就算你真能賜予我<imp>完敗</imp>，我也會做好<imp>下一次對決的準備</imp>。
If you would indeed like to battle me, and the team I've assembled to take down Lambert, just ask.
只要你有空了，可以隨時來找我！
The berry plant is growing.

Skipping Tamarind cutscene.
跳過塔瑪琳的開篇劇情。
Morning, \PN, I'm <imp>Professor Tamarind</imp>.
早上好\PN，我是<imp>塔瑪琳博士</imp>。
I'd say "welcome to Makya!", but that's not really why you're here.
畢竟你不是來這裡旅遊的，我就不說什麼“歡迎來到馬凱亞”了。
C'mon. Let's get you set up.
時間寶貴，跟我來吧。
Looks like we’re both moving on. Don’t worry, I’m not coming with you.
是時候出發了，放心，我不會跟著你的。
But, uh, there’s something I kinda forgot to fill you in on.
不過還有件事忘了告訴你。
Do you know about <imp>Team Chasm</imp>?
你知道<imp>裂隙隊</imp>嗎？
So, Team Chasm used to run this place. All of it -- the whole region.
裂隙隊是這裡曾經的管理者，我說的不只是這座島，而是整個馬凱亞地區。
They turned Makya from wilderness to a real region over the past twenty years.
他們用了二十年的時間，將馬凱亞從一片荒野，發展成如今的模樣。
Then, well, you know how it goes.
然後...嗯...就在八年前...
Some kid trainer decides to go on a rampage and takes the whole organization down.
一些年輕的訓練家聯合起來，將整個組織給搞垮了，
That was eight years ago.
這事鬧得蠻大的。
But, uh, those people didn’t just disappear. Half the people you meet are gonna be ex-members.
我說這些是想告訴你，就算組織已經解散了，曾經的成員也不會就此消失。
Even more than that in the regional administration. They’re chill, but just… it’s better to know.
你在這裡遇到的人，起碼有一半都曾是裂隙隊的一員，他們依然掌握著資源與權力...言盡於此。
Oh, so you did your research? Great. Spares me the effort.
哦？看來你做過功課了？也好，省得我浪費口舌。
Anyways.
總之，
I know you only care about being Champion and impressing Mommy.
我知道你只在意你媽媽的看法，以及如何成為這裡的冠軍，
But between the avatars and, uh, other issues, I’ve got problems that need taking care of.
但是很多問題是你繞不開的，比如“化身”什麼的...
You’re talented and I can make it worth your while.
反正總會遇上，不妨順便幫我解決一些麻煩，
Well, keep it in mind.
當然，這不是要求，是交易。
See ya, kid.
再見了，小孩兒。
Hey!
嘿
I'm bored and want to have fun. Let's play hide and seek!
太無聊了，來跟我捉迷藏吧！
I took some TMs from my Pa when he wasn't looking.
我趁爸爸不注意拿了一些技能機，
If you can find me, I'll give the TMs to you.
只要你能找到我，它們就是你的了。
I'll be somewhere on the route to the foreclosed tunnel. Smell ya later!
我會藏在城鎮北邊的某個地方，快來找我吧！

Hey, \PN. I heard you beat Lambert.
嘿，\PN，你已經打贏蘭伯特了？
Guessing you’re gonna head for the <imp>mainland</imp> now?
是前往<imp>大陸</imp>的時候了對吧？
Well, before you go, meet me at the dock, 'kay?
走之前先來碼頭見一面怎麼樣？
Got something to say. Thanks.
我有事跟你說。
She hung up...
掛斷了……
Be careful outside the Villa, you don't want to end up as another incident in the newspapers.
在鎮子外要小心一些，你也不想成為報紙頭條上的受害者吧？
No, I'm not talking about wild Pokemon.
並不是說那些野生精靈有多危險，
Haven't you heard about the... "avatars" I think they were calling them?
難道你沒聽說過...他們好像管它們叫“化身”來著？
It's seemed like all anyone has wanted to talk about for 3 months!
最近三個月大家都在談論它們！
I for one can't wait for the whole thing to blow over, so I can read again about things of real interest.
希望這熱度趕緊消退吧，我更想在報紙上看些有用的東西。
Like the stock market.
比如說股市預測什麼的。
Closed while Lambert participates in the Makya Championship Tournament.
馬凱亞競技大會期間暫時閉館。
You keen to take me up on my offer?
要來一場對決嗎？
Understood.
我知道了。
I'll be here until you wish to battle.
我會在這裡等你的。
Nice. Let's get into it.
很好，那就開始吧！
Well fought!
打得不錯！
As promised, despite your overwhelming victory, I remain enthusiastic to try again.
不過就算你取得了完勝，我依然想再試一次。
Well, still some kinks to work out, it seems.
很棒，不過還有進步空間。
Heal up, and return to me at your leisure.
幫你的精靈恢復後再來吧。
As a fellow competitor, I have nothing to say but to congratulate you on your victory over Lambert.
作為競爭對手，我只能祝賀你戰勝蘭伯特。
I'll take this as the cue to go make my attempt as well. Wish me luck!
我也會以此為契機，繼續加油的！
That was a fun game of hide and seek!
真好玩，真好玩！
I've learned that if I offer stolen goods to people, they'll let me do whatever I want!
我明白了，只要把偷來的東西作為獎勵，就能讓別人聽我的！
Lambert has some interesting choices of Pokemon.
蘭伯特有一些很有趣的精靈。
His prized Riolu was a gift from Victoire, another gym leader. Sangfroid, he calls her.
比如說另一位道館館主維克托送給他的那隻利歐路，它的名字是“靜靜”。
A beautiful name, in my opinion!
真是個可愛的名字啊！
I believe Lambert also has a Croagunk. Or.... two of them?
除此之外，蘭伯特還有一隻...或者說兩隻不良蛙？
I'm not sure, but I swear I saw a sparring match, where the two seemed identical...
誰知道呢，反正我是看到過他拿出兩隻不良蛙的比賽…
As a fisher, you learn to pick up on small inconsistencies around you.
作為一名合格的釣魚佬，必須要著重鍛鍊自己的觀察力。
Take for example that bush behind me. I bet something's going on with it.
就比如說後面那個草叢，我一眼就看出它不對勁！
Would you look at that! Found yourself something nice.
看吧！你找到東西了！
Keep an eye out for those sort of things. Don't be afraid to poke around a bit.
所以要學會眼觀六路耳聽八方，不要嫌累，嫌麻煩。
You never know what you might find...
誰知道下一次會找到些什麼...
Oh, you just got a MasterDex? They're pretty neat.
哦，你拿到大師圖鑑了？
Of all its features, the DexNav is my favorite.
我最喜歡的是“圖鑑導引”系統！
It's a really fun way to see what Pokemon you still have to catch in a new area.
我們可以利用這個系統，看到當前區域還沒有抓到的精靈。
Once you've caught one, you can also use it to find more of that same species!
而且還能幫助我們捕捉更多已經抓過的精靈！
Isn't technology amazing?
這就是科技的力量！
You haven't completed what you need to on the island yet!
先處理完這座島上的事情再出發吧！
Would you like to leave Casaba Villa and go to the Mainland?
要離開甜瓜島前往大陸嗎？
Oh, so it is you!
哦，你來了！
Forgive my doppelganger – a Ditto that stalks me incessantly, claiming to be the real deal.
還請你原諒另一個我 -- 那只是一隻有些調皮的，試圖冒充我的百變怪而已。
I had a dream that I would find someone here, and here you are!
我曾多次夢到在這裡與某人的相會，而現在，你出現了！
May I read your palm?
我可以看看你的手相嗎？
Oh? Afraid I may hex you?
嗯？你怕我詛咒你？
Rest assured, gramarye isn’t my forte.
放心，我是占卜師，不是巫師。
Very well.
好吧...
At least take this. It’s designed to ward off evil.
這個給你了，它有一定的驅邪功能。
Many thanks.
哼哼。
Now, let me see... yes, of course.
讓我看看...沒錯，千真萬確！
You are the shuttle of fate’s weave. Undoubtedly who I have awaited.
你就是命運之梭的執掌者，是那個我一直在等待的人。
Your future is fraught with danger, of course, so I made this to ward off evil influences. Please, take it.
你的前路充滿了艱難險阻，所以我為你準備了這個，它或許能幫你渡過難關。
Well, I think my stalker and I shall be off now.
現在我要跟她離開了，
She wishes to visit some <imp>ice cave</imp> or another to prove a point.
她貌似想去<imp>冰之洞窟</imp>看看，
I dare not leave her alone, claiming to be me, so off I go!
我不可能放任另一個自己在外遊蕩，所以我必須跟上去！
Fare you well, traveler!
最後祝你好運，旅行者！
Lambert, the gym leader, came running through here earlier.
蘭伯特館主剛剛去西邊了，
He put a rock behind him to block it off, for some reason.
而且還故意用石頭堵住了路...誰知道他到底怎麼想的。
You need to get through?
你要去海灘那邊？
Well...there's an abandoned tunnel up to the north.
嗯...北邊有一個廢棄的隧道，
You can probably find something to blow this rock up if you go there.
那裡或許能找到一些可以炸開這塊石頭的東西。
Oh hey, you cleared out that rock!
哦，你把石頭處理掉了！
Who knew explosives could be so useful?
這炸藥竟然這麼猛？
We'll see.
走著瞧
...
。。。
Oh, shut up.
閉嘴！
Sure.

I don't need your help.
誰需要你幫忙？
No

Yes
走
Maybe later.
稍等一會兒
Sure, let's go.

I'm a safety minded person.
我是一個很注重安全的人。
For that reason, I wear a Hi-Vis Jacket with me wherever I go.
因此，我無論走到哪裡都會帶著一件顯眼的夾克。
Everything's changed now that Avatars are around.
但現在有了化身這個威脅...
I'm worried they'll be drawn to me by the reflections.
我很擔心他們會被這件夾克的反射吸引過來。
If you're going out and fighting those things, maybe that's somehow an upside for you...?
如果你想主動跟那些東西戰鬥，這或許會是一種幫助？
I'll need to check Eleig.com for any new safety products that will work on Avatars.
我得去網店上看看，有沒有什麼針對化身的安全裝置。

I caught this Pichu in the really tall grass!
我在那片高草叢中抓到了這隻皮丘！
Oh, didn't you know?
嗯？你還不知道？
The Pokémon that live there don't live in the other grass!
那邊生活著跟普通草叢裡完全不同的精靈！
Even my new Pokémon couldn't cut it...
即便有了新精靈還是贏不了...
Hmm, we'll see how they do on another try.
嗯，我們回頭再試一次吧。
I wonder if there's good things to catch in the Cave up to the North...
不知道北邊的洞窟裡會不會有更好的精靈可以捉...
The berry plant is growing.
樹果還在生長中。
I dropped my items! Where did they go?
我東西呢？掉哪兒了？
I can't believe I lost so badly!
竟然輸得這麼慘...
Guess I'll have to try again later.
回頭再來一場！
Come back tomorrow, I might have more energy then...
等明天吧，我得先休息一下…
Oh, er, you look like you want to battle.
呃...你想跟我對戰？
I'm not a Trainer. You can tell by the fact that I don't have a <imp>follower Pokemon</imp>.
我不是訓練家，我身邊並沒有<imp>精靈跟隨著</imp>。
Dunno if you're new here or something, but Trainers in Makya will usually have a Pokemon by their side if they're looking to battle.
不知道你是不是剛來馬凱亞，在這裡，那些想要戰鬥的訓練家，都會將自己的一隻精靈帶在身邊。
Cuts all the awkward confusion with the eye contact stuff.
這樣可以避免尷尬的眼神交流。
Anyways, now for the real reason I'm here.
至於我為什麼會在這裡...
Name's Jovan. I'm with Research and Development at Sweetrock Candy Company.
我叫約凡，是蜜巖糖果公司的研發人員。
I need test subjects. Since you're a licensed trainer, you can help me out. Take this.
我正在尋找合法的訓練家幫我測試新的產品，如果你願意幫忙，請帶上這個。
Once you train your Pokemon enough, this thing will start popping out candies.
當你的精靈到達極限後，這個裝置就會產生經驗糖果。
Have your Pokemon eat them. It'll let them grow stronger.
餵給那些還不夠強的精靈，就能讓它們快速形成戰力。
Since you're such a good sport about it, I have another treat for you if you find me on the beach.
既然你這麼配合，如果你在海灘上找到我，我還有一份禮物給你。
See ya then.
拜~

Shiny Pokemon!
閃光精靈！
My life has been spent in pursuit of these Pokemon, the most unique of all!
它們是我這一生的追求，是最為特別的存在！
Years ago I caught wind of a unique substance called Gleam Powder, that can only be found here in Makya.
幾年前，我聽說馬凱亞這裡有一種叫說閃亮粉末的東西。
Shiny Pokemon are hyper rare, but a little bit of Gleam Powder will attract them to you like magic.
這種粉末能像魔法一樣，吸引到那些閃光的精靈。
My artist's instincts drew me to another use: Turning boring standard Pokemon into Shinies!
但作為一名藝術家，我想到了另一種用法，那就是把普通精靈變成閃光！
If you can find some of that mystical Gleam Powder, it'd be my pleasure to paint one of your Pokemon into a glamorous shiny.
如果你能找到一些閃亮粉末，我很樂意將你的精靈，變成更為迷人的閃光形態。
I will have to charge, though. $30,000.
不過，是收費的，$30,000一次。
So, do you have any Gleam Powder? ...and the $30k?
你有閃亮粉末嗎？並且有$30,000嗎？
Oh, how boring it is to live a life without shinies.
唉，沒有閃光的生活多麼無聊啊。
No
沒有
Yes
有
[Map145]
Whew...
呼……
Good work. I thought I'd be working for hours to fix a mess caused by that Deerling.
幹得好，我本來以為得花幾個小時處理這個問題的。
The Pokemon's yours, so long as you never tell my boss...
這隻精靈是你的了，只要你不告訴我老闆…
SHHHHHHHHHH!
噓......
Quiet, stand still.
安靜，別動。
I left the door open while I was on break.
我休息時沒有關門。
This Deerling wandered in. Help me here, would you?
然後這隻四季鹿就跑進來了，你能幫幫我嗎？
Go up and catch it while it's not looking at us.
麻煩趁它不注意時抓住它。
Just sneak up to it, it seems like it's tired.
就悄悄地走過去，它好像有些累了。
You walk over to the Deerling, and the maid hands you a Pokeball...
你悄悄走到四季鹿身旁，接過了女僕遞過來的精靈球...
You move into position...
準備就緒...
And tackle the Deerling before it can react!

You toss the Pokeball to catch the Deerling!

You’re already in my grasp, and I am not afraid to bribe you to keep you there. I come bearing gifts, you see.
我已經知道怎麼跟你相處了，你看，我帶了禮物，靠這個應該可以吧？
But, to reach something resembling a point, I am here to reach a revelation.
不過，為了達到某種效果，我還在等待一個啟示。
Look at this city: a sprawling blight. How many habitats, nests, spawning grounds were all stamped out for this?
看看這座城市：一個蔓延的瘟疫。為了建造它，有多少巢穴、棲息地都被摧毀了？
A concrete atrocity, paving over the world.
這種鋪設在世界上的混凝土暴行...
…Perhaps. Pokémon have made their warrens here, too.
…或許，這裡的地下，也有精靈創建了自己的家園。
The old died out that the new might live. Not so much erasure, then, but rather…
舊的消失了，新的得以誕生，所以這不是抹除，而是...
Indeed they do. Life has not been extinguished like a match ground underfoot. It has simply undergone a…
的確，生命並沒有像是被踩滅的火柴一樣消失，而是經歷了一種...
I lived a great many years in a single-story nest of wood. It was comfortable enough.
我曾經在一座單層的木製巢穴中生活了很多年，那裡還算舒適。
And yet everywhere I wander I find more wilderness gone. A creeping…
然而，無論我走到哪裡，都會發現越來越多的生機消失。逐漸被…
Agree with what?
同意什麼？
With me? I am not so sure I agree with myself. After all, life thrives here, albeit in different forms.
同意我的想法嗎？我自己都不知道自己是不是對的。畢竟這裡也有生命在茁壯成長，儘管其形式並不相同。
Evolution? Devolution? Certainly a…
是進化，退化？還是說…
Transformation.
轉化。
And so I find myself here. The wild and untamed has shapeshifted into humanity.
所以我發現自己出現在這裡，曾經的原野也變成了人類的巢穴。
That is what a city is, yes? The human biome?
或者說城市，對嗎？這是人類的生物群系？
So what can I learn from all this? Is this what I am? An expression of humanity? Or is this a fake, too? With the untamed merely putting on a charade?
那麼我能從中學到什麼呢？這是我，還是人類的體現？還是說只是一個假象？只是原野在裝模作樣？
Do you believe I’m the real one?
你相信我是真的嗎？
Thank you. I merely wish to prove it to her.
謝謝，我只是想向她證明這一點。
It would be a mercy, really – she is living a lie, quite literally. She deserves to be true to herself.
這其實也算一種仁慈...她一直活在一個謊言中，她應該對自己更真實些。
Hmph.
哼。
I suppose I can’t blame you. My assumption that my counterpart is a Ditto is founded purely on it being the only explanation.
我想我也沒辦法怪你，畢竟我的存在對應著百變怪，你最開始得到的就是這個解釋。
Hardly convincing, but I know I am real, and therefore she cannot be.
我知道很難讓人相信，但我自己清楚自己是真實的，那麼她就不可能是真實的。
…Ah.
…啊。
I suggest you simply make up your mind, one way or another. In indecision lies madness.
我建議你還是做出一個要麼是，要麼否的判斷，猶豫不決只會讓你走向瘋狂。
In truth… sometimes I doubt myself.
其實…有時我也會懷疑自己。
I remember being a child. I remember living years under my old home.
我記得小時候的生活，記得在老家度過的歲月。
And yet, I cannot remember when she began following me. No more than I can remember being born.
但是，我卻記不起她是何時開始跟著我的，也不記得自己是何時出生的了。
Does that make me…
這讓我…
But nevermind that. I have a gift.
不過，這不重要。我有一份給你的禮物。
Something destroyed by its transformation. And yet, it has found strength in that.
它經歷了毀滅和轉變，但在其中找到了力量。
I am unsure of what that may imply about my situation, and so I pass it on to you.
我不確定這是否與我的處境相關，所以我決定把它交給你。
Imogene passes you a Poké Ball. Inside is a Galarian Corsola. It seems happy to see you… as much as it can seem happy.
伊莫珍將一個精靈球遞給你，裡面是一隻伽勒爾太陽珊瑚。它似乎很高興見到你…儘管表情不太明顯。
Another arrow in your quiver. Or perhaps another companion for the long road ahead.
這是你旅途中的又一件武器，或者是又一位夥伴。
In either case, may it prosper under your care.
無論哪種情況，都希望它在你的照顧下茁壯成長。
So long, traveler. I will head south, to home. You’re a welcome guest if ever you should arrive.
旅途愉快，我要往南走，回家去了。如果有機會，歡迎你來做客。
Oh? Very well.
哦？好吧。
If you find it unsuitable or untenable to take it, I will find someone else. Perhaps the local Pokécenter will take it in the interim.
如果你覺得不適合或者無法照顧它，我會找其他人來接手。也許當地的寶可中心可以。
In any case, I take my leave.
無論如何，我先告辭了。
I will head south, to home. You’re a welcome guest if ever you should arrive. So long, traveler.
旅途愉快，我要往北走，回家去了。如果有機會，歡迎你來做客。

馬凱亞的確有一些奇特的岩石，哪怕是充滿了懷疑精神的我也無法否認這個事實。
But Chasm members could talk about Pikachu being an Electric-type and I'd still pull out my MasterDex to double check.

OK c’mon you really definitely gotta help me out like I’ll give you half the loot?
你真的一定要幫我，我可以給你一半剛得到的東西。
You wouldn’t leave me out here, right? By myself?
你不會讓我一個人面對危險，對吧？
Nah, you’re cool. You’re a cool person. You’re gonna help me.
當然不會，你很有風度，你肯定會幫我的。
I maybe sorta committed a robbery.
我可能...參與了搶劫。
And breaking and entering.
還有...入室盜竊。
And arson.
還有...縱火。
But it was an accident!
但那是意外，不是我想這麼做的！
OK, just the arson was accidental. But I swear I didn’t rob anyone that didn’t totally deserve it.
好吧，只有縱火是意外...我發誓我搶的那些都是壞人！
So shut up and help me, OK?
所以別再問了，幫我好嘛？
What I’m gonna need you to do is give me some cover.
我需要你幫我打一下掩護。
Duel me? Like, so they just see a fight and move on?
類似於...跟我決鬥？大概...讓他們從而忽略我？
Y’know, like in a movie when they kiss so the bad guys get all flustered?
或者...大概...電影上那種...就...通過親吻的方式躲過追捕？
I figured you’d be more into, like, fighting me than kissing me. Especially if I, like, healed your team.
如果要決鬥的話，我...大概...會治療你的隊伍，大概...你更喜歡這種選擇吧。
Y’know. No offense!
你知道的，不冒犯

And you – you’re, like, yep. Totally A+. S+, if you want to be, y’know, kinda extra.
你的表現...大概...嗯...絕對是A+，如果你不滿意，我也可以出於個人情感給你S+！
Which I am. Kinda cringe…
呃...有點尷尬…
Wait!
等等！
Don’t just scurry off. I’ve got, like, WAY too many Potions, so lemme fix you up.
不要急著離開嘛！我手裡...大概...有很多藥品，現在讓我幫你治療一下。
Seriously, do you always just, like, bolt when you lose? You looked about ready to black out…
難道說，你每次輸，大概...都這樣像兔子一樣逃跑嗎？你看起來就像要暈了一樣...
So! Yeah! That worked!
也就是說...耶！方法奏效了！
Honestly, like, totally better than I expected.
其實...大概...比我預想中好得多。
Here: I got you something.
這個...是給你的。
I needed one to evolve Jeanne, 'cause she’s always been more of a Gallade kinda gal, y’know?
我需要一個進化石讓讓娜進化，因為她一直更願朝艾路雷朵的方向發展。
But it turns out they’ve got, like, industrial amounts of stones in town. So I liberated a few extras.
他們把幾乎所有進化石...大概...都集中到這座城市裡了，所以我解放了其中一部分。
And, uh, yeah, you helped, so you get a share. Thanks!
沒錯，你也幫了忙，所以你也有份，謝謝！
I gotta skedaddle, but I’ll catch you around!
我得走了，但我們還會再見！
You draw Candy in for a kiss.
你輕輕環抱著吻向糖兒。
The people chasing her pass by you, paying no mind.

好了，這個辦法成功了！
I’m gonna take that win and not think about this further, because, uh… yeah. Moving kinda fast, heh.
我會享受這次的勝利，不用再思考那麼多...呃，沒錯，雖說進展有些快了。
…You’re a bastard. You’re just gonna leave me hanging like that?
...你...你個混蛋！你就把我晾在這裡？
I’m literally being hunted! I’ve committed felonies!
我現在還在危險中呢！
Fine – I, like, don’t have all day here, y’know! I’m out!

I know I just look like a jogger, but I'm really a detective working with the Makya Rangers.

We received a tip that the folks over at Aegis Insurance were running protection rackets.
我們接到線報，宙斯盾安保公司正在經營非法業務。
I need someone who can bust in and grab the evidence I need.

I left a forged ID card in the patch of grass near the eastern gatehouse. Just root around for a bit and you should find it.
我把一張偽造的身份證件，留在了往東去的路口旁的草叢裡，你在那裡逛逛應該就能找到。
It'll let you get in. Be ready for a real tough fight, they probably got a team of minions ready to battle.
你可以通過它進入大樓，但依然要做好激戰的準備，他們的人手絕對不少。
If you get the evidence, I'll make sure you're rewarded.
你要你拿到了我需要的證據，我會給你豐厚的回報。
Any luck? Did you get the ID card in the grass? It's near the eastern gatehouse.
進展怎麼樣？找到那張身份卡了嗎？就在城市東側的草叢裡。
Once you've got it, you should be able to go upstairs in the Aegis Insurance building.
只要你拿到它，就能進入宙斯盾的大樓了。
They'll probably have the good stuff up there, behind a group of minions no doubt.
他們重要的東西都在裡面，當然也會有很多看守。
Make sure you and your Pokemon are ready for a massive scrap.
一定要確保你的精靈已經做足了激戰的準備才行。

言歸正傳。
I don’t know how you’ve gotten here so quickly, but I’m going to find out.
我不知道你是怎麼追這麼快的，但我會找到這個答案。
Fight me.
跟我打一架。
Right here, right now.
就在此時，此地。
Wow, so rude.
切，粗魯！
I can’t believe you wouldn’t want to talk to your own flesh and blood.
怎麼的？不願跟你自己的親人說話？
Oh, sure. Take all the time you need.
呵，隨便，想要幾分鐘都可以。
But you’re not getting any farther until you show me what dirty tricks you’re using.
但是在我逼出你的卑鄙手段之前，別想著就這樣離開！
Oh good. I’ve been looking forward to curbstomping your team since you picked a starter.
很好，自從你跟上來之後，我就期待著能碾壓你的這天。
Ready to learn some humility?
準備好學會謙卑了嗎？
Alright. OK. Sure, of course.
行吧，行吧，就這樣吧。
Why wouldn’t you annihilate a team without a scratch on yours? How could I not expect this?
為什麼你一隻都沒有就能...你讓我怎麼理解這一切？
Why would I think my work would count for ANYTHING? Ugh. You’re infuriating.
你讓我這段時間的努力成了什麼？我現在做的一切還有什麼意義？
...I can’t believe it.
...我不能接受。
I spend MONTHS out here, grinding my ass off to get this far, and you traipse in like it’s nothing.
我在這裡花了幾個月的時間，拼上命才走到這一步，而你卻像郊遊一樣就跟了上來。
Why are you better? Why are you always better?
為什麼你比我更好？為什麼你總是比我更好？
Fine! I guess I’ll see you in the championship.
行吧，就這樣吧。我們競技大會上再見。
Watch your back out there, though.
不要以為這就完了。
I will get better, and then I’m going to find you.

C’mon. One more bout.

You’re joking.
你說什麼？
You’re not even going to try?

You just want an opportunity to be smugly superior, like you always have.
你一直都表現得好像高別人一等，一直以來都是這樣！
Figures. The only reason you’re doing this is to get more attention from mom.

The door is securely locked.
門被鎖上了。
The sages wish to reverse the island's death. They are foolish.
先知希望能扭轉島嶼沉沒的事實，真是愚蠢。
The island cannot be saved, I have already seen it among the dead.
這座島已經無法挽救了，我能看到它奄奄一息的樣子。
Perhaps an outsider like you has a unique perspective.
或許你這樣的外來者，會有不一樣的視角。
This island is old. There spirits here are tired.
這座古老小島的靈魂已經疲憊了。
I wonder where they might go, but I am not worried. They seem content.

I have seen my own life sink below the waves.
我曾目睹自己的生命沉入了波濤之下。
I want to save what is left.
我想拯救所剩無幾的事物。
I am simply enjoying the last of my home. This soothing breeze will the be the last.
我只是在享受最後的家園，享受最後的舒緩的微風。
Please, you have lived with us for generations!

What could we possibly offer now?!
現在我們能做些什麼？
There is not much time left for my home. I will enjoy it while I can.
家鄉留給我的時間不多了，我會趁現在好好享受它。
I thank you for giving me an excellent parting memory. Now, it's time to go to my new home.

Uhhhhhh... Welcome! To our uhhh... humble abode?

We used to get more guests a looooong time ago, but we don't get them much now. I guess a sinking island isn't the best place for investors...
很久之前這裡的客人還比較多，但現在已經沒有往日的輝煌了，對投資者來說這裡並不是啥好地方...
Oh well! Can't save 'em all... just uhh... enjoy it while it lasts? Haha...
好吧，這樣也挺好...只是，呃...現在好好享受吧，哈哈！
Anyways! We have a healing center! I'm qualified a nurse, actually! Just don't have the typical uniform.
起碼，我們這裡還有治療中心！其實我也是個有執照的護士，只是沒有制服罷了。
We certainly like to battle here on this island! Just like uhhh... literally every other person... So that's cool!
我們島上的人也很喜歡對戰，跟其它...地方的人一樣，大概...畢竟這很酷！
Anyways I'll be in that building behind me if you need me! Ummm, enjoy your stay and uhhh... talk with some of the locals!
總之，如果你需要我的幫助，那就到後面的房子裡找我，祝你在這裡玩得開心...另外，多和當地人聊聊天吧！
Leave us to our ways, Trainer.
別管我們了，訓練家。
You had to meddle. We have lost our traditions because of you!
就是你們在多管閒事，因為你們，我們失去了傳統！
Ah, a visitor. It is rare to see one nowadays. I can hardly remember the last one's face.
啊，有一位訪客！已經很久沒人來這裡了，我都快想不起上一個訪客的樣子了。
It's a shame. Memory is the only thing we have, and the only tool we can work with.
真遺憾...記憶是我們唯一擁有的東西，也是我們唯一可利用的工具。
Tell me Trainer, what is your greatest memory?
訓練家，你最美好的回憶是什麼？
A mighty accomplishment indeed. I wonder, will it be your favorite when you lose the title?
這的確是一項了不起的成就，我想知道，當你失去冠軍頭銜後，你最喜歡的還會是它嗎？
You possess a full heart, Trainer. I wonder, will it be your favorite after you have seen them for the last time?
你有一顆飽滿的心，訓練家。我想知道，當你最後一次與他們相見後，你最珍視的記憶，還會是這一部分嗎？
A feat of courage, and a show of strength! I wonder, will it be your favorite when your anger cools?
這是勇氣與力量的展示！我想知道，當你的怒火平息，最懷念的還是這一部分嗎？
It is wise to look forward. I wonder, will it be your favorite when you only have the future?
展望未來是明智之舉，但我想知道，如果只有未來，那它還會是你的最愛嗎？
This island, our home, will soon be nothing but a memory. What an awful fate.
這座小島是我們的家園，但它很快就會成為回憶，這是多麼可怕的命運。
There is nothing that can be done other than making one last memory.
除了留下最後的記憶外，我們別無他法。
A final hurrah before the shore closes in. A battle to shatter this island's very roots.
在海岸逼近之前最後的狂歡，一場足以摧毀島嶼根基的戰鬥。
Are you ready, Trainer, to battle?
你準備好了嗎，訓練家？
There are memories to be made, Trainer. Do not leave me apathetic.
我們都有美好的回憶，訓練家，不要讓我對此感到遺憾。
A disappointment, to say the least.
最終，還是失望。
If there is one think I know though, it is that minds can change. Change mine.
我明白，思想是可以改變的，或許我應該改變自己的想法。
Very well, I shall be here, looking for another memory.
好的，我就在這裡，等待著下一段回憶。
I suppose that's that then. A final memory.
我想就這樣吧...最後的記憶。
It was not unpleasent, Trainer. It was the best we could do in such a short time.
這算不上愉快，訓練家。但這麼短的時間，也只能如此了。
If you would like, this is our farewell. Soon, we will fade into each other's memory. Some time after, we will fade even further than that.
如果你願意，這將是我們的告別，很快，我們就會淡出彼此的記憶，再過一段時間或許會完全消失。
But perhaps, there is something more. I must gather myself inside my little cove. You are free to follow.
但是，或許還有更多東西...可以藏在我自己的小海灣裡，你請便。
I cannot let this happen!
我不會讓這一切發生！
There is nothing left for us to do...
我們已經無計可施了...
I ache Trainer! There is hole in one's self when they lose their home, it is a heart torn in two!
我好難過，訓練家！當一個人失去家園時，他的內心就會被空洞撕成兩半！
The past has always been outside of our reach. And yet, when you cannot see it, it feels even further.
過去總在我們的視野之外，越是看不到它，越能感覺到它的遙遠。
And yet, I do not feel despair. I feel bittersweet. When I think of home, it is impossible to not feel a little bit of warmth inside.
但我並不會對此感到絕望，我只會同時感覺到痛苦與快樂。每次想到家園，內心都能感受到一絲溫暖。
Have you felt that conflict before, Trainer? A feeling of warmth and joy that lives within sorrow?
你感受過這樣的衝突嗎，訓練家？那種悲傷中摻雜著溫暖和喜悅的感覺？
I know your pain, Trainer.
我能明白你的痛，訓練家。
The world is never the same after someone leaves, but we are always glad that we got to live in that world.
當某個人離開後，世界也不再是之前的那個了，但我們總會慶幸自己曾經生活在那個世界當中。
We think of the time spent with them, doing nothing. We regret it. Yet, that time is where they became who they are to us.
想起和他們一起的無所事事的時光，會讓我們感到遺憾，但也正因為他們，我們才會成為今天的自己。
One day, maybe, we can forgive ourselves.
也許有一天，我們可以原諒自己。
They never look at us the same afterwards.
在那之後，他們看我們的目光就不一樣了
You realize you cannot imagine them without thinking about how their expression changed when they learned of your failure.
我們會意識到，自己無法想象他們在得知我們的失敗之後，表情會發生怎樣的變化。
Sometimes, it is a necessary mistake to make. There is no growth if we let ourselves simmer.
有時，這是必然的錯誤，如果任由自己沉淪，就不會有所成長。
Then you are blessed now and cursed to feel it.
所以，你很幸運，能感受到它的詛咒。
But that is life, young one. You must realize that, as we love to say, it is what it is.
但這就是生活，年輕人，你必須一點點去理解事情的全貌。
I am filled with sorrow. It is the price I pay for joy.
我雖然心中充滿悲傷，但這是我為快樂付出的代價。
But I am not helpless. I choose to pay again and again. Each time it worth it.
不過我並非束手無策，我每次選擇的付出都是值得的。
Now, Trainer, will you show me a little bit of the joy you feel in battle?
現在，訓練家，你能向我展示下戰鬥中的快樂嗎？
There is no joy in battle without the bitterness of frustration. Let us pay your dues to our wiles.
沒有挫折的苦澀，就沒有勝利的喜悅，讓我們用詭計來償還你的代價吧。
Ahah! Take that!
哈哈，接招吧！
A-hem, I mean, frustration is a natural part of growth. Grow, and approach me again, Trainer.
我覺得，挫折是成長的自然過程，成長過後再來找我吧，訓練家。
Afriad? Or cautious? Ah, well, it doesn't matter.
是害怕，還是謹慎？好吧，無所謂了。
I will be here. We all smile eventually.
我會在這裡，我們都會得到微笑。
Perhaps you have caught a glimpse of that feeling, Trainer.
或許你已經觸及到這種感覺了，訓練家。
It matters not, you will feel it soon enough. It will feel wonderful and awful and all of those great things.
沒關係，很快你就能感受到，那些讓你覺得美妙與可怕的事物，以及它們所蘊含的美好。
I will collect my feelings before I leave. I'll be inside.
我會收拾好心情再進去，等待離開的那一刻。
If you would like to follow, you are more than free.
如果你想跟上來，我也不會阻攔你。
A guest! What a pleasant surprise!
有客人！真是驚喜！
Have you come to challenge me? I have a bit of time to test my mettle.
你是來挑戰我的嗎？我也的確有些時間來檢驗一下自己的實力。
Ah, but before we get too far ahead of myself, I must sate my curiosity.
啊，不過在這之前，先滿足一下我的好奇心吧。
You seem no stranger to struggle, but tell me, have you ever been broken by challenge?
看起來你應該很熟悉對戰吧，那你曾經被打垮過嗎？
Utterly shattered. Reduced. Something you viewed as damningly insurmountable?
就是被徹底打敗...那種事，或者說你覺得無法克服的事情？
Hmm, bold. It is one thing to break yourself for another. It is another for them to mock your pieces.
嗯，很大膽。為他人犧牲是一回事，被別人嘲笑不值又是另一回事。
It can be a moment that defines your world, and you are not in control of it.
這或許是一個你可以決定自己生活在一個什麼樣的世界的時刻，但你並不能掌控它。
And you certainly you gained something in the end! Of course, you know as well as any that the real danger lies afterwards.
當然，你肯定會有所收穫！而且你也應該清楚，真正的危險，還在那之後。
It is one thing to climb a mountain once. It is another to climb a hill each day.
爬山是一回事，但每天怕啥就是另一回事了。
If honesty were a virtue, you'd qualify as a saint.
如果誠實是一種美德，那你就可以被稱為標杆了。
Not that it's a good thing.
當然這也不一定是好事。
Then there is something you must do, now! There is a wide open world out there, but you must be torn down for a new life to grow!
那現在，有件你必須要做的事情，那就是剷掉眼前的這個廣闊世界，並讓新的生命再次生長！
But I digress. The force of will takes man and mon far, but it cannot always overcome cold reality.
抱歉，我跑題了，意志，能使人走得更遠，但它不是一定能戰勝冷酷的現實。
This island will be gone. There are some that refute that.
這座小島馬上就不復存在，但有些人卻對此反駁。
Sometimes, there is value in fighting the inevitable. Sometimes. I am never sure about it until it is over.
有時，與不可避免之禍鬥爭，會付出難以想象的代價。有時，在事情結束之前，誰也不知道是否還有轉機。
There are those who try to preserve this place, as foolish as that might be.
有些人在試圖保護這個地方，雖看看起來感覺很愚蠢。
I wonder how it will end up for them. It is a good trial, and a proper funeral.
雖然不知道他們的結局會如何，但這是一次合適的審判，也是一場體面的葬禮。
But that is them. I should focus on myself. I am ready for challenge. Are you ready for battle, Trainer?
但那是他們的事。現在我們該關注自己，我已經準備好接受挑戰了，你準備好了嗎，訓練家？
Excellent!
很好！
Now is the time! Let us break and reform from our struggles!
現在正是時候！讓我們從糾結中掙脫出來吧！
And you lay before me in pieces.
你在我面前支離破碎了。
There's only one direction to go from here. Regain youself, and try again. You can do better.
從這裡開始，只有一個方向，重新找回自己，再試一次，你可以做得更好。
Very well, but do not leave me waiting. I abhor idleness.
很好，但別讓我等太久，我討厭無所事事。
I am looking for one last trail myself. Are you ready for battle, Trainer?
我在尋找最後的蹤跡，準備好了嗎，訓練家？
Wonderful! It was about time for me to shatter!
太棒了，是時候讓我崩潰了！
I revel in that sting you get when you know you've been outmatched! It is undeniable, how jealous I am!
我陶醉於那種不敵對手的刺痛感，不可否認，我甚至有些嫉妒你！
But such a feeling is fleeting, for better and for worse.
但這種感覺無論好壞，稍縱即逝。
It's time for me to get ready for the next hill. I'll be inside if you need me.
我該為下一座山做準備了，如果你需要，我就在裡面。
These Guardians have been here since before all of us.
這些守護者在我們來此生活之前，就已經在這座島上了。
If there is a way forward, they will bring us there.
如果有出路，它們會拯救我們。
You have snuffed out any hope that we had.
你掐滅了我們的希望。
I'm not sure that it was a good or bad deed.
我不知道這到底算什麼。
We seek its power to heal our home.
我們尋求它治癒家園的力量。
You must have a plan!
你必須得有個計劃！
Centuries of guidance cannot end like this!
幾個世紀的傳承不能就這樣結束！
So many here wish to give up our homeland. To what! Simple time and happenstance?
這裡很多人都希望我們放棄家園，為什麼？只是因為時間和偶然？
I will depart, but I will be bitter. The spirit of our island will sink with it.
如果我離開，就會感到痛苦，我們的精神也會隨著島嶼而沉沒。
I am surrounded by fools! The sages are right! We must adapt or perish!
周圍這些人都是傻子，\先知是對的，我們要適應它，不然終將會滅亡！
Leave me be, outsider.
別來管我，外鄉人。
My Rampardos and I have a unique camaraderie. We suffer from hair loss.
我和我的戰槌龍們有一種獨特的友誼，我們都有脫髮問題。
I need to get a sick crown like my Rampardos...
我需要一個戰槌龍那樣的頭蓋...
I must treat the little hair I have left kindly.
必須善待我所剩無幾的頭髮。
Mmm. Maybe I should buy a hat.
嗯...或許我該買頂帽子。
Hon hon! This island has exceptional beauty! It is a shame I will be the last visitor to see it.
吼吼，這座島真漂亮啊！很遺憾，我將是最後一個看到它的遊客了。
Oh, are you also foreign to here? Well, that ruins the title of "last visitor".
哦？你也是外鄉人啊？好吧，這下“最後的遊客”就不是我了。
Ah, the locals here are so good at battling.
啊，這裡的人真擅長對戰。
I think I'll enjoy a fine Kalosian wine...
有點想念我們卡洛斯的美酒了...
Look towards the future, Trainer. You might miss how much of a mess the past becomes.
展望未來吧，訓練家，即便再怎麼懷念混亂的過去。
Come, my Pokemon. Let us take a final stroll.
來吧，我的精靈，讓我們最後再散散步吧。
It's a shame how the past has been tainted.
真遺憾，過去的一切都被玷汙了。
We are old minded here. But our ways are nothing in front of nature.
這裡的人們思想守舊，但在大自然面前，什麼也不是。
We like to forget that we are still a part of nature, no matter how high we build ourselves.
我們喜歡忘記那些，無論將房子修建得有多高，我們仍是大自然的一部分。

Honestly, I bring the two most explosive duelists I can find to Helena’s house and you can’t even break a vase?
我已經盡力把我能找到的兩個最具破壞性的訓練家帶到海倫娜家裡來了，你們甚至連一個花瓶都沒打破？
My luck… well, you’re both here.
什麼鬼運氣...好吧，現在你們倆都在這裡。
\PN, meet Yezera, former Champion. Yezera, meet \PN, future Champion.
\PN，這位是以前的聯盟冠軍葉澤拉。葉澤拉，這位是未來的冠軍\PN。
I wanted you two to meet, but I’m kinda getting the feeling you already know each other.
我想讓你們倆見一見，但看起來你們認識得比我預想中更早一些。
Figures. You’re an explorer, and she keeps away from the beaten paths.
也對，你身上有探險家的潛質，而她又總是偏離大路。
Or any paths at all, honestly.
或者說她根本不走任何大路。
Oh? Then things really have changed since last time we met.
哦？這樣看來上次見面後，
For both of you, now that I think about it.
你們兩個都發生了很大的變化。
Now that’s just grand.
那真是太棒了！
What I wanted, honestly. I’ve basically been shipping you two – except, y’know, with violence instead of…
這就是我想達成的目的，我一直想讓你們兩個聯繫在一起，即便用一些暴力手段...
I should’ve left that thought in my head.
好吧…
Anyways…
我應該把那種想法深埋在腦海裡。
Hah! So you’ve gotten the same treatment that we did.
哈！看樣子你也遭到了跟我們的一樣的待遇。
She’s good at what she does… and bad at what she doesn’t.
她有很擅長的領域…但在不擅長的事情上一塌糊塗。
Yezera… I can’t just ignore you.
葉澤拉...
Even if you’d like me to.
即便你希望我對你不聞不問，我也不能放任不管。
Are you OK? I haven’t seen you in…
你還好嗎？我們已經有一年多沒見過面了...
Over a year. Two since we’ve talked.
兩年了，從我們上次對話算起。
I’m – I’m fine but – I can’t. I can’t do this.
我…我沒事，但是…我不能。我不能這樣做…
Not with both of you – I’m sorry.
我不是不想和你們待在一起，我很抱歉。
Well… at least she’s alive and intact.
好吧...至少她還完好無損地活著。
Yezera. The girl that took down Team Chasm. First Champion of Makya.
葉澤拉，打敗了裂隙隊的女孩，也是馬凱亞的第一位冠軍。
Mystery disappearance, manhunt, no tracks, the works.
後來她神祕失蹤了，我一直在找她，卻沒有任何線索。
She’s grown since then… but still a nervous wreck.
這兩年她長大了...但還是那個容易緊張的姑娘。
Anyways. You didn’t come here for history.
哦對，哦對，你又不是來這裡聽歷史課的。
I wouldn’t go that far.
我不想說太多。
It’s stupid, is what it was. The whole shebang.
整個計劃，從頭到尾都荒謬至極。
But, yeah, anyways. Gift.
回到正題，這是我給你準備的禮物。
Yeah, I’ve wasted enough of your time.
也對，我耽誤了你太多時間。
That gift I mentioned – let’s get to that.
那現在讓我們談談，關於電話裡提到的禮物。
Indeed! I wanted to get you to meet her, but I know your type. I can bait a hook.
當然！我想讓你和她見見面，所以就拿這個作為釣上你的魚餌了。
Well, if you’re interested I can – actually, it’s probably better for you to hear it from her mouth. You’ll see her again.
好吧，如果你有興趣，我可以讓你…或許從她嘴裡聽到可能更好。你們肯定還會再見面的。
She wouldn’t let a potential challenger go.
她不會放過任何潛在的挑戰者。
But!
但是現在，
Your gift.
這是給你準備的禮物。
Since avatars turned the bridge to flotsam – and, yes, I TOLD THEM to reinforce it!
儘管我告訴過他們要加固大橋，但化身還是把它變成了漂在河面上的碎塊！
They didn’t, since they trust ex-Chasm about as far as they can throw them and – anyways!
那些傢伙把我的話當成耳旁風，畢竟他們不願意相信一個前裂隙隊成員
For very stupid, avoidable reasons, the river’s basically uncrossable without Surf.
由於這些本可以避免的愚蠢錯誤，現在過河的方法只剩下衝浪了。
If you’re like me, you’re not gonna pack a Water-type everywhere you go, so just use this instead.
如果你和我一樣，沒有隨身攜帶水屬性精靈的習慣，那就用這個代替吧。
It’s just more practical. Stylish, too! Assuming you’re good at it. Which I’m not.
這真是時尚又實用的辦法，當然前提是你別像我一樣，不能熟練操縱它。
Go have fun and get those badges.
去享受贏得徽章的旅程吧。
Oh, and, uh, this is Helena’s place, so feel free to eat some of her food or something before you go.
哦，差點忘了說，這裡是海倫娜的地盤，走之前可以隨意吃點她的食物什麼的。
Kick a vase over. Carve your name in the table. Er – maybe someone else’s name. Yezera’s name! She’d get a kick out of that. Heh.
打碎花瓶，並把名字刻在桌子上…或者刻上別人的名字也行。比如說葉澤拉！她會很高興的，嘿嘿。
You see your name carved onto the table.
你看到自己的名字被刻在了桌子上。
You see the name "Yezera" carved onto the table.
你看到葉澤拉的名字被刻在了桌子上。
You see the name "Tamarind" carved onto the table.
你看到塔瑪琳的名字被刻在了桌子上。
A vase filled with flowers sits delicately on the floor.
一個裝滿花的花瓶被擺放在地上。
You could totally smash this thing, if you wanted to.
只要你想，它頃刻間便會粉身碎骨。
You decide against smashing the vase.
你決定不打破花瓶。
You find a garbage bag, put the flowers in it, and swing it against the wall with all your might.
你找到一個垃圾袋，把花瓶放了進去，然後用盡全身力氣將其摔在牆上。
A garbage bag filled with rubble is all that remains of this once proud vase.
這個曾高高昂著頭顱的花瓶，現在變成了滿滿的一袋碎片。
Don't take the food.

OK.
好的。
Use your real team.
用你自己的隊伍吧

You had a gift?
不是有禮物嗎？
Actually, I kinda did.
我還挺感興趣的

打碎它
[Map185]
I've been stationed here to look for avatars.
我被指派到這裡尋找化身。
I haven't been able to find any, though, so let's battle!
雖然還沒有找到，但也不妨礙我們的戰鬥！
I can probably take a break, with Trainers like you walking around.
有像你這樣的訓練家在周圍，我可以稍稍休息一下了。
See ya.
再見。
Well, they don't pay me to bring my Max Revives home...
他們沒有付給我購買全滿藥的薪水...
I'm tending to my Pokemon right now.
我正在照顧我的精靈。
A portent felt, a divination.
這，就是預兆。
Chaos freed, eradication.
釋放混沌，根除混沌。
Wishes are a solemn curse.
願望是一種莊嚴的詛咒。
Left to rot, and they will burst.
任其膨脹，只會腐化自身。
A chain of flowers holding fast.
花環緊緊相連。
Will it crumble? Will it last?
是持續下去，還是就此崩潰？
Old times renewed, ones you must face.
你必須面對舊時光的重現。
In lashing out, they find their grace.
正視他們在狂熱中找到的恩典。
YEEHAW, ALL ABOARD THE LOG EXPRESS!
呀吼！全都上來！
RECKON TO FACE US ON MORTAL, HEARTPOUNDING, LOG COMBAT?!
你以為我們會跟你進行的是那種驚心動魄的生死木樁戰嗎？
WOWIE! That was some fine log battling!
哇，真是精彩！
Any log rider is a friend o' mine, don'chu forget it!
任何木樁上的戰士，都是我的朋友！
We're just making sure that the logs sent downstream by the local Biberal don't clog up the waterway.
我們只是在確保自由集團送往下游的原木不會堵塞河道。
It's honest work, and we get to have a little fun with it.
這份工作還是挺有意思的。
Good battle, Trainer. I'm sure everyone on the Stretch enjoyed watching that.
打得好，訓練家。我想大家都對這場對戰很滿意。
Hey.
嘿。
Gettin'... kinda nervous.
我...有點緊張。
Tamarind’s gonna show. I’m sure of it.
我敢肯定，塔瑪琳會來的。
Told her to meet me inside. I’ll go around the back, you go in the front, we’ll cut her off, no problems, clean and easy. Capisce?
先讓她進到裡面去...現在我繞到後面去，你從前面進入，這樣就能形成堵截之勢，她就插翅難飛了。能明白我的計劃嗎？
Great. Like, yeah, of course.
太好了，大概...就這樣行動！
You’re my friend, right?
我們是朋友，對吧？
Oh, yeah, I’m, like, yeah. I’m, like, totally ready.
當然，我，大概...已經準備好了，我完全準備好了。
See? Normal Candy!
嗯，我現在是塊薄荷糖！
Don’t be silly. We’re, like, totally gonna make things better.
別擔心，我們會讓一切朝著更好的方向發展。
At least a little bit.
哪怕只有一丁點。
Um, like, good question, but isn’t it kinda obvious?
嗯，大概...好問題，但是顯而易見吧？
Like, she’s gotta confess and tell us what she did, right? And then we’ll bring her to justice!
大概...她必須坦白告訴我們她之前都做過些什麼，然後我們就會把她繩之以法
...OK, to be, like, totally honest with you: I’m worried you’re gonna betray me.
...好吧，說實話，大概...我最擔心的是...你不是站在我這邊的。
Because she, like, did you a favor and you’re working with her and all that.
畢竟她幫過你的忙，你們還在一起工作什麼的。
But you won’t. I mean, like, she caused all of this! This entire place is mega-screwed because of what she did!
但我覺得你不會的，我是說，大概...她是一切的罪魁禍首！整個地區都因為她的所作所為陷入了大麻煩！
Eh! No! No talking! I can’t hear you!
不！不！什麼都別說！我一個字都聽不見！
I am one hundred percent not interested in, like, anything you’re saying. I trust you. I trust you, and that’s that.
無論你說什麼我都不感興趣，我只是單純地相信你，僅此而已。
So you go in and I’ll scoot ‘round the back, and we’ll do a pincer maneuver, alright? Let’s go!
你走正面，我繞到後面，按計劃一起行動，好嗎？出發！
West: Eleig River Crossing
西：埃利格渡口
East: Canal Desert
東：運河沙漠
I've been managing the wildlife here for years, I've become an honorary Bibarel!
作為一名光榮的自由集團員工，我已經在這裡管理生態好幾年了！
Whoa! That last move almost smashed the whole dam! I'll get right back to work fixing it up!
哇！這最後一招，差點把水壩給拆了，我得趕緊回去修！
Another day, another trainer recklessly battled on this new dam. My Pokemon love the thrill!
又是新的一天，\又有訓練家在這個新水壩上戰鬥，我的精靈們喜歡這種刺激感！
This is such a nice spot, I should bring a couch out here.
這地方真不錯，我應該帶一張沙發來。
Used to look a little more pretty before the Biberal cut down the trees, but I appreciate the company.
自由集團砍伐這邊的森林前，這裡的景色要更好看一些，不過現在人氣比之前旺了。
Um... hey.
那個...嗨…
So, Tamarind and I, like, kissed and made up? Kinda?
我和塔瑪琳走到一起了？大概...也許吧！
Um, not in that way. She’s like twenty-five years older than me.
呃，我不是那個意思。她比我大二十五歲。
I... \PN, I still really hate her. She is, like, the worst.
我…\PN，我還是很討厭她。她就是...大概...最差勁的那個人。
She’s this snooty arrogant brat that literally destroys things that get in her way for no reason. But, like, I can’t just punch her and make it better.
她就是一個自大傲慢的嬌嬌女，沒有任何理由地摧毀她前進的路上的一切。但只靠打她一頓...大概...並不能讓一切變好
...But I did punch her.
...可我確實打了她。
Not really! It was kind of a wimpy punch. Still, I had to do it.
我沒有下很重的手！只用了一種較為溫和的手段，我必須這樣做。
For baby Candy, at least.
至少為了將來的小糖兒...
I know, I know! It was stupid.
我知道，我當然知道！這很蠢。
But, like, I’ve thought about it so many times, and now I finally got to do it.
我想這樣做...大概...已經很久了，現在我終於將它變成了現實。
It didn’t make me happy, but I can scratch it off the list, y’know?
的確這並沒有讓我感到快樂，但我可以把這個目標從心中刪去，你能明白嗎？
Oh, not even. She deserves to be punched, like, at least twice.
不，一點也不。她至少應該...大概...被打兩次。
What? That punching her doesn’t make it better?
你想說什麼？打她不會讓事情變得更好嗎？
Or that I, like, decked her in the first place? Because the answer is yeah, I’m a learning Candy.
或者說我打她...大概...是錯的嗎？恐怕是這樣的，我現在只能算是個小號的經驗糖...
Really, I let her off easy. But, um, I didn’t really let her off.
實際上，我反而給她減輕了壓力。但是，嗯，我並沒有真正原諒她。
I kinda... got hired? Like, I do not trust that hag for a second, so I’m gonna stick to her like a Remoraid.
這好像...讓一切...變成我的職業了？大概...那個老太婆我一秒鐘都不願相信她所以我會像鐵炮魚一樣附在她身上。
She’s gonna fix all the messed-up stuff that she and her cronies caused.
她需要彌補一切她和她的黨羽造成的混亂。
And she’s, like, totally overworked, so, um... yeah. I’m her aide now!
而且她正在全力做這些，大概...所以，嗯...是的，我現在是她的助手。
And bodyguard. And conscience.
同時兼任保鏢，還要作為她的良心去監督。
I get to get justice, and she gets to not have her labs be on fire. Everyone wins.
我可以得到正義，她可以讓實驗室不再著火，雙贏。
Heh… thanks. I’m, like, not sure of anything right now.
真的...謝謝。我現在...大概完全不能確定自己做的每個決定是不是對的。
Who knows! Maybe I’ll think better of it tomorrow and firebomb her lab anyways!
管他呢！也許我明天會想明白一切，然後照例燒燬她的實驗室！
Hey! What’s that supposed to mean?
嘿！那是什麼意思？
Do you think I’m just, like, this belligerent ditzy manic Spritzee dream girl?
你認為我只是一個冒著傻氣，好鬥又易怒的粉香香嗎？
No, but, yeah, I get it. I don’t know that I’m, like, super cut out for this either.
不，可是…沒錯，我明白。我也不清楚自己...大概...是否適合這個工作。
Um. I think, like, you can get fired for that? So... no?
嗯，我覺得，大概...這樣做可能會被解僱吧？所以...不行？
Maybe. I’ll think about it.
誰知道呢，我會考慮一下。
Well, now if I want to steal someone’s Pokémon back I can just have Tamarind order it, so, like, I guess not?
的確，如果我現在還想要偷走別人的精靈，只要讓塔瑪琳下個命令就行了，所以我覺得沒必要了吧？
I’m still gonna steal things. Let’s all be, like, honest for a second: I’m not changing my ways.
但我可不敢打包票，讓我們都誠實一點：我不會改變我的作風。
But I am gonna be busier with other stuff now! So, yeah. There’s that.
但是我現在有其他更重要事情！這會消耗掉我多餘的精力，大概...就這樣。
Oh, by the way, Tamarind was all like:
哦，順便說一下，塔瑪琳剛才說：
“If you want proof that I’m doing my damnedest to help this region” and then she blabbered about like a secret lab and horrible monsters.
“如果你想要確定我正在儘自己所能幫助這個地區什麼的”，然後她突然跑題嘮叨起來，說了一些關於祕密實驗室以及可怕的怪物的事情。
Y’know. Like, containing an extradimensional evil and all that. Anyways, she gave me this key, but I don’t really, like, care?
像是一個超維度的邪惡生物之類的，隨後她給了我這個鑰匙，但我不是很在意這些。
Like, sure, whatever, she did hard work. She wants to prove she’s good, she can put her money where her mouth is and prove it by working with me.
大概...當然，她也付出了很多努力，她如果想要證明自己，完全可以付諸行動，和我一起工作來證明自己。
Anyways, um… you can have it? Maybe cool stuff? Maybe extradimensional evil?
我只是...你可以拿走它嗎？裡面可能是很酷的東西？又或者是超維度的邪惡？
Um, anyways, yeah. I, um, yeah.
嗯，不管怎麼說…我…我，我想說。
Thanks.
謝謝。
Thanks, like, a lot. You’re a good friend.
真的非常感謝，你是個真正的益友。
But, um, I think that’s it.
差不多就這樣了。
I have to go with Tamarind now and make sure she doesn’t, like, kick a child or something on the way back to Prizca.
我現在必須和塔瑪琳一起離開了，確保她不會在回宏禮市的路上踢路邊熊孩子的屁股，或者做其他不怎麼合適的舉動。
So, this is goodbye. And, well, you know what that means.
所以，這就是告別了...你知道這意味著什麼。
*sniff* Yeah... aww, \PN, we can’t be justice friends anymore.
*哭泣* 是啊...嗯…，\PN，我們不能再做正義之友了。
We’ll just be regular friends.
我們只能做普通的朋友了。
I’m gonna see you again, I know, but… we had like an arc together! We had an arc, and now it’s over. *sniff*
我知道我會再見到你的，但是...我們本應一起冒險的故事，\一起為了正義而奮鬥的故事，現在要結束了。*哭泣*
Aww, don’t tempt me. But, um, I kinda had my Pokémon tussle with Tamarind back there and they need to rest for now.
哎呀，不要妄圖誘惑我，我的精靈剛剛才和塔瑪琳打了一架，它們現在需要休息。
Maybe someday? Jeanne wants to kick your ass.
也許有一天？我是說也許，讓娜想狠狠地揍你一頓呢。
Like, not your Pokémon. You. Sorry! Watch your back out there, I guess.
大概...不是你的精靈，是你本人！對不起…在外面一定要注意安全。
Oh!
哦
Um, listen, you’re really cute but I’m not really... into you?
嗯，聽著，雖然你真的很可愛，但我還沒喜歡你到那種程度。
I’m, like, super into the sweep me off my feet romance story kinda thing?
我只是...大概...那種喜歡浪漫故事的人。
Like, theoretically if I needed to disguise myself while bad guys were searching and I had someone I could kiss to hide my face. Y’know. Cliche stuff.
大概...打個比方，如果我得在壞人追查時隱藏自己，我能做出親吻某個陌生人來擋住我的臉之類的事情那種相當老套的情節。
But, um, I’m not, like, into actual relationships? If that makes sense?
但我不是真的喜歡戀愛關係，如果你能明白我的意思。
No! We, like, didn’t learn anything from this.
不！我們大概...的的確確，沒有因此做出太多改變。
We un-learned things.
我們只是讀懂了反面教材。
Listen, we are, like, the dumbest people alive.
或許，我們大概...就是世界上最蠢的人。
That’s why we’re obsessed with justice and, um, kinda impulsive!
這就是為什麼我們一直醉心於所謂的正義…抱歉，有點衝動了。
Mainly me, but you too. I know it. We’re twinsies.
主要是我，但你也是，我知道，我們是彼此的鏡子。
...I’m gonna miss the hell out of you.
...我會非常想念你的。
I know, I know! I’m not, like, going-going. But, like, it feels that way. And I miss you already. Hug?
我知道，我知道！這不是永別，這不是！但，感覺沒什麼差別...我已經開始想你了...我們能...抱一下嗎？
Um... \PN? I’m, not, like, the healthiest person? Like, in the head.
嗯...\PN，我...大概...是不是...根本不是一個心理正常人？
I’ve done some pretty iffy stuff myself because I was, like, well, this is for justice.
因為自己覺得那樣是正義就做出那些糟糕的事情…
Like that makes it OK.
謝謝，我好多了。
So, um, maybe working with Tamarind is a way for me to get justice for myself, too? And, yeah, I could probably use some therapy too.
所以，嗯，也許和塔瑪琳一起工作是我尋求正義的另一種方式？可能我需要一些心理治療。
And I understand if you don’t wanna be my friend after hearing that, but, um, I hope I see you again anyways. I’m gonna make things better.
如果你聽完剛剛這些後不願再跟我做朋友，我也能理解，但是，我還是希望能再見到你。我會拼盡全力讓一切變得更好。
You go stop Yezera. Make sure all my hard work doesn’t get, like, undone, OK?
葉澤拉只能拜託你去阻止了，以確保我的辛勞不會白費，好嗎？
Thank you, \PN. I… I gotta go. But I hope I see you again. Thanks for showing me what justice is.
謝謝你，\PN。我...我這次真得走了。我真的希望能再見到你。謝謝你讓我懂得了什麼才是正義。
...Ugh, that was cheesy. I, um, yeah. Love you. Toodles.
...啊，這太肉麻了。我…我…我…我喜歡你，拜拜。
You’re cool. You’re, like, my favorite person.
你是我見過最酷的人，你是我最喜歡的人。
I know you’ve still got, like, a lot of stuff to do, so go do it.
我知道你還有很多事情去做，我會永遠為你加油。
I’ve got stuff to do, too. If Tamarind wasn’t waiting I’d, like, hug you for an hour.
現在我也有必須要做的事情了，如果不是塔瑪琳在等我，我大概...會讓你再抱我一個小時。
But, um, gotta go, I guess. You’re... we’ll see each other again? Right? Yeah. Of course we will.
但是，我真的真的得走了，你...我們會再見面對吧？一定會的。
I, um, yeah. Love you. Bye. Toodles!
我是不是囉嗦太多了...但我還是想最後再說一句，我喜歡你，再見！
Oh, so it’s you again. You’ve arrived at a rather fortuitous time.
哦，又是你。你來得正是時候。
I’ve caught this pair of Makyan forms and would like some more data – but excuse me. Again, my manners.
我捕捉到了這些馬凱亞形態正打算進一步觀測戰鬥數據...哦，抱歉，請原諒我的失禮
May I ask your name?
我還不知道你的名字？
Ah, \PN. I’ve heard that name about. A pleasure to meet you properly this time.
啊，\PN。我聽說過這個名字，請允許我正式地向你問好。
How droll. I suppose I am a stranger, after all, though.
沒錯，我忘了，真的很抱歉。
As I was saying: I would like some combat data. You seem to be quite adept at providing it.
正如我剛剛所說：我需要一些戰鬥數據，這應該是你很擅長的事情吧？
Shall we?
讓我們直接開始？
Of course. I wouldn’t want the results to be tainted.
當然，我不想得到受其他因素干擾的結論。
Adaptation via vendetta – I’m expecting viciousness. Let’s see.
在仇恨中適應新環境 - 真是殘忍到令人興奮啊！讓我們來見識見識吧。
Shall we get down to it?
我們開始吧？
Highly educational.
非常有教育意義。
It would seem that both of them have been honed by their vendetta.
看起來它們兩個都被仇恨磨練得更強了。
From what I’ve gleaned in local sources, the Sevipers became Steel-type to fend off Zangoose.
根據當地收集的信息來看，飯匙蛇為了抵抗天敵貓鼬斬演化出了鋼屬性。
They managed to drive the local Zangoose populations to extinction, yet even that didn’t stop the feud.
它們想方設法清除了這裡的死敵，但這並沒能讓一切結束。
Fighting until they died, and then even beyond. The tenacity of the Zangoose is admirable, no?
貓鼬斬的韌性也令人欽佩，它們沒有選擇就此逃散，而是戰鬥到用盡最後一絲力氣。
The Zangoose counter-adaptation – the Fighting-type – seems to be a product of their indestructible spirit.
正是在這樣堅不可摧的信念支持下它們逐漸演化出了能反制仇敵的格鬥屬性。
Curious. Could these be the predators the Furrets adapted to beat?
不過這樣的演化好像對被捕食的大尾立更有利？
No, the Psychic type would hurt as much as help.
也不對，超能屬性會幫倒忙的。
A mystery for another time. I would like to thank you for your help, but actions speak louder than words.
這就是另一個需要時間驗證的謎團了。我想比起口頭感謝，你更喜歡這個。
Take this, from my homeland.
這是來自我故鄉的禮物。
Goodbye. I can’t say where I’ll end up next.
再見。我不知道我下一站會去哪裡。
Perhaps the <imp>sewers beneath Prizca</imp>. If any biome might cause new forms to emerge, it would be that.
也許是<imp>宏禮市的下水道</imp>。但肯定是生物群系發生變化，導致新的地區形態出現的地方。
The Saurenaid is humming a pleasant tune.
紹爾納德正在哼著悅耳的曲子。
It's strapped up with multiple cushioned seats for travel.
它背上綁著好幾個座位，看起來可以乘坐它旅行。。
Kid, I, uh, heard the screaming.
我聽到了尖叫聲，怎麼回事？
Figured I ought to stay in case there was an attempted homicide.
以防萬一，還是先去看看吧。
So I heard.
我聽到了。
No problem. It’s my job... I think.
沒問題，這是我的工作。
...Fair. Not yet, though.
...好吧，但還不夠。
Sounds like it. Condolences.
聽起來令人同情。
Um, in case what she said is getting to you, I’m sorry. You made the right choice. She... she’s got some issues.
嗯，如果她說的話讓你感到不爽，我向你表達由衷的歉意。你做了正確的選擇。她...她有些不正常。
If you want some proof that I really am trying my damnedest to make this place better, take this.
如果你想要確保我真的在盡我所能讓這個地區變得更好，那就拿上這個。
It’s a lab where some stuff went down. None of it my fault.
這是一個遭到了破壞的實驗室，但這不是我的問題。
On top of everything else, I’ve been keeping extradimensional monsters at bay out of the kindness of my heart.
除此之外，我還一直保護著這個地區免受超維度怪物的侵襲，這完全是我自發的行為。
Really.
真的。
I do want the best for this place. Hopefully once you see all the work I’ve done that’ll be obvious.
我確實希望這個地區變得更好，一旦你親眼看到我所做的一切，就不會再懷疑我。
But, um, I know I’m not really wanted right now, so I’ll be going.
但是，嗯，我知道大家現在並不願接受我，所以我就選擇了離開。
You... you did the right thing, kid.
你...你做得對，孩子。

啊，我認識你。你是來馬凱亞地區挑戰各個道館的訓練家。
To be honest, I was nervous -- being the returning champion and all. I suppose that will be you soon enough.
其實，我很緊張...因為你估計很快就能成為冠軍，而我是去年得到的這個頭銜。
Ah, I recognize you. You're the new Trainer blazing through the Makyan Gym Challenge.

At the rate you're going, I have no doubt that you'll be attending this year's tournament?

My name's Elise.
我叫伊莉莎。
I normally just run things around here at the castle. Not too unlike my anscestors of old, minus the whole royalty deal.
我通常只是在這裡管理城堡的事務。和我的祖先沒什麼不同，只不過沒有皇室的身份。
Well, while you're here...
既然今天你出現在了這裡…
Want to have a friendly battle? It'll help us both to stay in form.

自從裂隙隊被迫解散後，情況就變得有些奇怪了。
Besides the occasional showmatch, there's very little for royalty to do.
除了偶爾參加表演賽外，皇室成員都天天無事可做。
Before this, Team Chasm would always approach me with some deal or threat. While I don't miss it, I can say it was a motivation for staying sharp.
在那之前，裂隙隊總會以交易或威脅為手段來接近我。我並不是懷念這些，只是將其作為保持敏銳的動力。
Ah well, I suppose I should pick up a second hobby. Let's battle again one day, Trainer.
或許，我應該再找一個愛好。改天我們再戰吧，訓練家。
This clown sucks.
這個小丑太差勁了。
I need to get a hobby, I can't spend all day like this.

You’re special. We – we both know that.

I made a mistake – I was a… I was a child, \PN. And children are stupid sometimes.
我犯了一個錯誤…我當時還是個孩子的時候，\PN，有時候孩子們真的很傻。
I’m going to make it – make it right. Make it all better.
我會讓一切變得更好...所有的一切...所有...
I’m stealing Regidrago.
我要把雷吉鐸拉戈偷走。
I don’t – I’m not going to lie. I’m unsealing the things I helped reinter, and… I don’t know.
我不會撒謊…我正在解封我曾經幫忙封印的東西…但我不知道後果會如何。
I don’t know what to tell you.
我不知道該怎麼告訴你。
I could try and convince you that I’m doing the right thing.
我可以試著說服你我在做正確的事情。
I could – I could tell you so many reasons and justifications and… it wouldn’t matter.
我可以...可以告訴你很多理由，用各種方法辯解，但這都沒有用。
We’re going to fight anyways. I’m not going to go easy on you – I can’t afford to.
我們無論如何都要戰鬥，我不會手下留情…我承受不起。
So… try to make sure they don’t – keep your Pokémon safe. I don’t want to hurt them. I just need to buy a little time.
所以...請確保他們不會受傷...保護好你的精靈。我不想傷害它們，我只需要拖延一點時間。
I… I’m in far too deep at this point to back out.
我已經陷入泥潭了，沒有抽身的可能。
Good. I don’t… I don’t want to hurt you, either.
好的，我也…不想傷害你。
Don’t expect a fair fight. I’m sorry, but I – I have to do this.
不要意味這是場公平戰鬥。很抱歉，但我必須這樣做。
…Yeah. Me too.
沒錯，我...
Well, here goes. Artemisia, take the lead.
好了，開始吧。蒿蒿，出擊。
Don’t dive too deep – we’re getting out of here soon. Fend them off.
不要進去了，我們很快就會離開這裡。抵擋住它們。
But if they put up a fight… crush them.
但如果它們反抗...就粉碎它們。
I can't - you make Alessa look like a rank-and-file grunt.
我做不到...阿萊莎在你面前就像個普通士兵。
Well. I've gotten what I came for; slowed you down.
好了，我已經得到我想要的了，拖延了足夠多的時間。
I'm… glad to be your rival. Thanks.
我…很高興成為你的對手。謝謝。
I – uhf. I crippled one of their teams, but they got away. They’re good, dammit. And I’m out of practice.
我…呃...我打敗了他們中的一個，但讓他們逃走了。他們很強...該死！我也生疏了...
Here – I can heal your Pokémon. Mine are going to need a little care before I’m ready to move out. But you go on ahead. Here.
來，我可以治癒你的精靈。在出發之前，我的精靈需要休息一會兒，但你可以先上，這裡。
You’ll use them better than I can.
你會比我用得更好。
Now go after them.
現在去追他們。
The door is tightly locked.
門被緊緊鎖住了。
…Yezera, why would you – oh, \PN. Yeah, I can help heal your Pokémon.
…葉澤拉，你為什麼要…哦，\PN。我可以幫助治癒你的精靈。
Now go deeper into the catacombs, one of them is still down there.
現在進入地下墓穴吧，他們有一個人還待在裡面。
Nobody followed you? Good.
沒有人跟著你？很好。
You know those weird caves around Makya?
你知道馬凱亞周圍那些奇怪的洞穴嗎？
Desert with canals like circuit boards, or a mine where steel floor grows naturally.
像電路板一樣的運河沙漠，或者自然生長著鋼鐵地板的礦山。
Those are where the Regis are entombed. They’re Pokémon of incredible power that Team Chasm used to dominate the region.
那裡是巨人的墓地，他們是極其強大的精靈，裂隙隊曾經就是用它們來統治這個地區的。
My hands ain’t clean on that, either, and now someone’s trying to break out my old bruiser: Regidrago.
當然我也難辭其咎，現在有人試圖解放那個老傢伙：雷吉鐸拉戈。
We don’t know who, and we don’t know why, but that thing was buried for a reason.
我們不知道他們是誰，也不知道為什麼要這麼做，但那個東西並不是無緣無故被封印的。
Because Yezera told us to, and because we – I’ll explain later. Time’s of the essence.
是葉澤拉讓我們封印它們的，因為我們...我等會再解釋，時間緊迫。
Yeah, and I’m sorry for not cluing you in earlier, but what’s done is done.
是的，很抱歉沒有早點讓你知道，但一切已經發生了。
We need to move, now, if we’re gonna catch whoever’s in there.
如果我們想要抓住那個人的話，就必須趕緊行動。
I can pull some strings, make sure you can catch up to your brother.
我可以幫你一些忙，讓你能夠更快地追上你的兄弟。
And if you don’t help, maybe the opposite. So quit whinging and help.
如果你不幫忙，也許會有相反的結果，所以別抱怨了，答應吧。
Follow me. If there’s a fight, you take point and I’ll flank. I’m good, but I’m not that good.
跟著我，我實力很強...但強得有限。如果有戰鬥，你走在前面，我會從側面進攻。
They’re in the catacombs.
他們在地下墓穴裡。
The door Regidrago’s locked behind should be impenetrable, but… let’s go check it out.
雷吉鐸拉戈鎖住的門應該是無法打開的，但...還是讓我們去看看吧。
Just to make sure.
只是為了確認一下。
Let me pass.
讓我過去
Why?
為什麼？
What are you doing?
你在幹什麼？
Don't do this.
不要這樣做
Very well.
好吧
I'm looking forward to this.
我很期待這個

This is a lot.
這很困難
Why should I help?

You know the first champion of Makya? I heard she lost her arm by feeding it to a starving Pokemon.
你知道馬凱亞地區的第一位冠軍嗎？我聽說她把自己的胳膊餵給了一隻快要餓死的精靈。
Talk about inspiring loyalty. I bet her Pokemon would follow her to hell and back.
她的精靈一定無比忠誠，無論去天堂還是進地獄都會毫無怨言地跟著她。
I smuggled some dynamite into the city, but I think the cops are onto me.
我走私了一些炸藥進城，但我覺得警察盯上我了。
Take it off my hands for $5000?

You'd be doin' me a solid.
你可是幫了我大忙。
Some days you just can't get rid of a bomb.
有時候你就是甩不掉一顆炸彈。
My worryin' will soon be over.
我的煩惱很快就會結束了。
You hand over $5000 in exchange.
你遞出了5000美元作為交換。
I'm outta here--gotta store this cash.
我得走了——得把這筆錢存起來。
Quit yankin' my chain.
別逗我了。

Well, I got the selfies I needed. These'll be going in the scrapbook for sure.
很棒，我拍到了需要的照片。我一定會把它放進相冊裡。
Have you ever done scrapbooking?
你做過拼貼而成的紀念相冊嗎？
I find it really comforting. We only have our memories after everything, ya know?
這能讓人感到欣慰。畢竟，一切都將化作回憶。
CAUTION: Deadly magma ahead!
注意：請遠離岩漿。
Red lines of graffiti criss-cross the word "magma". The word "lava" is written beneath.
“岩漿”這兩個字是用縱橫交錯的紅色線條組成的，用以警示來此的冒險者。
You one of them Casaba folk?

在牧場時我可從來沒戰鬥過這麼多次。
The grass here is full of soot! Useful for growing plants and Grass-types.
這裡的植物上滿是火山灰！不過它們是利於植物生長的對草屬性的精靈也是同理。
All this sand is starting to get in my clothes...

Have you meet the Soot Collector? He makes the coolest instruments!
你見過收集火山灰的人嗎？他能把這些製作成非常酷的樂器！
The natural soot here is perfect for my Bellossom!
這邊的純天然火山灰對我的美麗花很有用！
The stuff near factories usually have chemicals in them, so I can't use those.
但工廠附近的那些通常含有些雜七雜八的化學物質，所以我不敢隨便用那些。
A tattered and locked door.
一扇上鎖的破門。
A letter tacked to the door reads "Moved to Kalos. Not dealing with lava."
門上粘著一封信，上面寫道：“搬家去卡洛斯了，遠離討厭的岩漿！”
South: Foreclosed Tunnel
南：被查封的隧道
So ya muddled your way through somehow, huh? Got that look in your eyes like you know.
你總算是混過來了，是吧？眼神裡還透著一股自信。
Big ol' conspiracy, huh? Been lied to? Yeah, well, comes with the territory. Better get suited to it.
發現那個大陰謀了？感覺自己被騙了？嗯，這是常有的事，最好習慣一下。
'Course. We’re confidants, Yezera and I. Nearly decked her when she told me, too.
的確，我和葉澤拉是密友，她告訴我打算做的一切時，我差點沒忍住揍她一頓。
But she always was the smarter one 'tween us. Who the hell am I to second-guess her?
但她一直是我們倆中更聰明的那個，我有什麼資格去懷疑她呢？
Maybe I am, maybe I ain't. Don't matter much, do it? You plannin' on arresting me? Hah.
或許吧，誰知道呢，那不重要，還是說，你打算逮捕我？哈。
Looking right as rain, ain'tcha? Heard from a fortune teller that you’ve got a steel core to you.
這樣就對了，我聽說你有一顆鋼鐵般的內心。
Maybe she was right. Might be able to use that.
我想她說的沒錯，這正是你所擁有的品質。
Hah! Don’t kid me, babyface.
哈！別逗我了，小傢伙。
But, uh, you ain't exactly the kid that strutted into Novo, cocky as all get-out.
不過，你已經不是之前那個，在望新鎮自以為是的小孩了。
Still cocky. Got some ice to you, too, though.
雖然還是有些自以為是，起碼比之前冷靜很多。
Wasn’t plannin’ on inviting you out here to chat, though.
不過我不是邀請你來這種地方聊天的。
Goes like this: Yezera’s about to do somethin’ real stupid.
你應該也知道一些：葉澤拉要做一些不折不扣的傻事。
I ain’t bright enough to know if her plan’s worth it or not. Figure that’ll be settled with a duel – ain’t no other way for the likes of us.
我不夠聰明，分不清她的計劃是否值得，我想這將通過決鬥來解決 - 對於我們這樣的人來說，沒有其他的辦法，不是嗎？
And she’ll be facin’ one of us, so why don’t we get some training done?
她總要面對我們當中的一人，那不如趁此機會訓練訓練吧。
Don’tcha burn yourself out now. Push yourself too hard and ya might just snap.
不要讓自己過度勞累，過度勞累會讓你走向崩潰。
Oh, I oughta let you know: used to be I did bounty hunting for Chasm. I ain't about to play fair or clean.
現在我也應該說明白一些了：我曾經為裂隙隊做過黑手套，所以我不會遵守所謂的“公平”。
I only play for keeps.
我只為勝利而戰。
Ya ready?
準備好了嗎？
Eh.
嗯。
I’ve fought better in my time, ain’t no question 'bout it.
看來我的水平還是有所下降，畢竟已經不再刀口舔血好多年了。
Still, ya beat me. Hope ya learned something.
既然你能打敗我，我希望你也能從中學到些什麼。
Kid, answer me somethin’. How do ya feel about Yezera?
小傢伙，回答我一個問題，你是怎麼看待葉澤拉的？
Ain’t much of an answer. I like her too, mind you; maybe a li'l too much.
這答案有點模糊了吧？不過我也喜歡她...或許喜歡得還有點太多了。
Figures. She ain’t easy to love sometimes, y’know? Goes double for when she’s up to somethin’ like this.
很正常，畢竟大家跟她之間總有不能相互理解的地方，尤其她現在還在做這些事。
Well, how 'bout that. You can tell I like ya, 'cause I ain’t even gonna hurt you for sayin’ that.
哼哼，看來你能看得出，我對你感覺也挺不錯的，不會因為這句話而物理上揍你一頓。
'Cause she betrayed you? Or 'cause she’s obnoxious?
因為她背叛了你？還是單純討厭她的個性？
Or, heh, 'cause she keeps givin’ you a run for your money?
又或者她一直讓你很頭疼？
Don’t really matter what you say. If wishes were Rhyhorn, yeah?
不管怎麼說都無所謂了，畢竟嘴是會騙人的。
We’ll see which side of the line ya fall on when it comes down to it.
等到真正需要選擇的時候，我們就能看出你站在哪一邊了。
Gotta strong urge to say somethin’ heartfelt – guess I’m gettin’ sappy.
我最近有一種強烈的願望想說些真摯的話 - 也許我變得感性了吧。
Like I said, though, words are cheap. Take these.
算了，說再多也沒用，拿上這些。
I’ll see ya 'round. Don’t you worry 'bout finding me. I’ll find you 'fore the end.
再見了，別擔心找不到我，因為我會主動來找你的。
Then we’ll settle what to do 'bout Yez. Love that girl...
然後再去解決那個我愛著的女孩…也就是葉澤拉的問題。
You knew?
你知道？
You in on it?
你也參與了？
Don't care.
我不在乎
Already am.
我已經知道了

I was brought here to speak about how to best combat the avatar threat.

He works at the castle on the north side of the city.
他在城市北側的城堡工作。
He always gets involved with dangerous Pokemon, and I'm not just talking about the avatars he fights.
他總是被捲入進與危險的精靈的對戰中去，我指的不僅僅是化身。
It always looks like he's a breeze away from being caught in the blasts...
他總是看起來離意外只有一步之遙…
The avatar crisis is really starting to threaten our wellbeing.
化身帶來的危機真的開始破壞我們安定的生活了。
If it weren't for the Rangers and their volunteers, avatars would probably be causing irreparable damage.
多虧了義軍和那些志願者們，不然化身可能會造成不可挽回的損失。

Ma'am if you would!

Coupled with the incident at Velenz, how can people be confident that Makya is a safe place to live?
再加上之前在夜幽市發生的事情，還怎麼讓人們相信能安安全全地生活在馬凱亞地區呢？
Are you scheduled to speak later today?
不好意思，我得先確認，你今天在會議上有發言的安排嗎？
No? Then I'm gonna have to ask you to find a spot to watch the conference.
沒有？那請您在後方觀看會議。
I work here in the capitol building, recording meetings and the like.

There's this girl who is friends with everyone.
那個跟所有人都是朋友的女孩。
Wherever I go in Makya, I keep hearing her name.

...啊？你這是什麼眼神？
You're creeping me out, I'm leaving.
不許盯著我，我走了！
I've lived a life of luxury, in no small part due to my lucrative career as a Trainer.
我年輕時作為一名訓練家，賺了不少錢，所以能過上富足奢華的生活。
I managed to get my hands on a few of these Amulet Coins.
年輕的時候，我曾設法弄到一些護符金幣。
They made me a fortune in no time at all.
它們幫我迅速積累起了財富。
But now I have a nice place for myself here. It pays well and it's easy on my body.
但現在我有了這份安定的工作，領著不錯的薪水，而且我的身體也不足以支撐我繼續東奔西走了。
I don't really need these anymore, so I'll give one to you.
我不再需要這些護符金幣，所以打算送給你一個。
Do well for yourself.
請繼續努力吧。
Making enough for yourself out there?
你在外面掙得錢夠多了嗎？
It's hard being a career Trainer. You need to make sure you've got your basics taken care of.
成為職業訓練家很難，你需要保障自己的基本生活需求。
The door is locked.

Makya is at a critical point in its history.
馬凱亞正處於歷史的關鍵節點。
Either we become a fully fledged region, or we get relegated as merely secondary.
要麼我們成為一個完全成熟的獨立地區，要麼我們被降級為次要地區。
I don't want this place to end up like Orre, dismissed as a third rate region with a fourth rate League.
我不希望我們的家園最終像歐雷一樣，被認定為一個人厭狗嫌地方，只能保留一個上不了檔次的聯盟。
Makya's Pokemon League has gathered quite a few skeptics.
馬凱亞的精靈聯盟聚集了很多陰謀論者。
The region doesn't have a traditional Elite Four, and Gym Leaders here aren't exactly career Trainers either.
這個地區沒有傳統的四天王，這裡的道館館主也不是職業訓練家。
Some especially harsh critics have claimed that the whole thing is simply a front for a rebranding of Team Chasm.
一些極其嚴苛的批評家聲稱這一切都只是一個經過重新包裝的裂隙隊。
They're right, but not in the way they think.
他們在某些方面是對的，但並不都是他們想的那樣。
Obviously I'm biased since I'm former Chasm myself, but I really do think the League here is a real attempt at going legit.
當然，我的觀點未必客觀，畢竟我自己就曾是裂隙隊的一員，但我真的認為現在的聯盟正在一步步嘗試著走向合規。

Cool. If you don’t mind, I’m gonna add a little bit of chaos into the mix: you’ll lose your cool before I do.
很好，如果你不介意，我想稍微混入一點混亂元素：你會在我之前躁動起來。
Yeah, sure thing. I’m more of an artist than a fighter, but I hear I’m not half bad.

No mistaking the work of an expert.

Please take my badge.

不管今年的競技大會結果如何，仍然會有很多訓練家不服氣，畢竟他們也都拿到過那個頭銜。
If you wanna be undisputed, you're probably gonna have to go through them.

Now that you've beat all of Scilla's students, she's probably going to make us do extra training.

The place is looking a lot better, but it can still use some interior work.
這個地方看起來好多了，但還需要一些室內裝修。

Yo, homeboss, we are Chara and Scilla's number one fans. We study all their techniques.

Go deal with the issue – you’re the better duelist. He’s down in the lower area causing havoc.
去處理下面那個傢伙，你的水準更高，阻止他讓整個地區陷入混亂。
You take care of that, I’ll help Samorn. Move it, Slowpoke.
你去處理那個傢伙，我來幫賽蒙，快點笨蛋！
Oh, it’s you.

As you might’ve heard, you’re too late.

噓，不該問的別問，不然你就會被請出去。
Testaments of an age.
舊時代的見證罷了。
Delicate as ever. Fine. Cease bothering me.

What’s the point of resisting, or creating? We’re going to pave it all over anyways.
抵抗或創造有什麼意義呢？反正我們最終會把它們都剷平。
And I don’t mean that philosophically. I will replace all of this with malleable white stone personally.
我可不是要跟你討論哲學，我會親自用可塑的白石頭來代替這一切。
A blank slate.
將其變為一張白紙。
Unlike Yezera, my perfect world is one in which human whim gets what it deserves.
我才不會在乎葉澤拉想怎樣，反正我要創造一個由人類的心血打造的完美世界。
Speaking of which, you’ve yet to be crushed underfoot. Let’s fix that.
不過現在，還沒能把你踩在腳下，對我來說可是莫大的遺憾啊！
…Well there goes Registeel. Hard to keep a hold of, those ones.
…雷吉斯奇魯又跑了，這些傢伙一直都很難控制。
What can I say? I’m… only human, after all.
我又能說什麼呢？我...也不過是個普通人罷了。
Fine. It can rust away in its tomb for all I care. It’s irrelevant now.
隨便了，讓它在墳墓中生鏽吧，現在已經不需要它了。
I'm out of here.

An item was left on the ground!
好像掉了什麼東西！
Hey.
嘿。
I, uh, heard everything when you fought that guy.
我，呃...我聽到你們說的了...
Yeah, yeah. Just scraped up a little. Nothing a Heal Pulse can’t fix.
啊，沒事，只是擦傷，用治癒波動就能解決了。
Can’t tell if you’re being a sarcastic snot or not.
我總覺得你在挖苦我。
Doesn’t really matter. You’re welcome.
無所謂了，不用謝。
Hey, listen, this’ll only take a minute.
別急，給我一分鐘的時間。
I just wanted to tell you… hell, is that really how I sound?
我只是想問...瑪德，你是怎麼看待我的？
Like that edgelord? Just another self-absorbed prick?
就跟剛才那個黃毛刺頭似的？就這麼不受你待見？
Heh. You’re squirrellier than a Furret sometimes.
呵呵，你有時候比大尾立還要神經。
Ah, you don’t have to tell me. I know.
行了，你不用再說了。
No sugarcoating it, huh?
毫不掩飾，是嗎？
Yeah. That’s fair.
也對，很合理。
You’re being polite even now? Or are you actually telling the truth?
你只是跟我客氣客氣，還是真的這麼想？
Listen, it really hurt admitting that you’re better than me back there. As a trainer, I mean.
的確，承認你比我強讓我很難受，我...我是說作為訓練家。
But somebody had to fight and somebody had to get Samorn out, and I’m a lot of things but I’m not stupid.
但必須要有人戰鬥，必須要有人把賽蒙救出來，我的確性子可能不太好，但我不是頭不分輕重的蠢豬。
You’ve always been better. I knew it, Mom knew it, and you… I hope you know it.
你一直都比我更優秀，我知道，媽媽也知道，你...我希望你也能知道。
This entire competition was stupid. Mom knew you’d win.
這場所謂的比試就是場愚蠢的作秀，大家都知道你會獲勝。
This was just a scheme so she could finally prove you’re better than me.
這只是媽媽為了證明這一點，拿來給董事會看的一項計劃罷了。
…Yeah.
也是...
You know Mavis as well as I do.
你和梅維斯一樣瞭解我。
I mean, yeah, makes sense. She wants an heir to the company… to the legacy… you fit.
我是說...沒錯，更合理，她想要一個公司的繼承人...繼承家族的一切...你很合適。
You know it is. Mavis is just as cutthroat as Helena – hell, maybe more.
你也知道，梅維斯和海倫娜一樣冷酷無情...甚至更甚。
You think a normal mom would encourage her kids to have a showdown a continent away?
你認為一個正常的媽媽會鼓勵她的孩子在遙遠的地方進行一場所謂的決鬥嗎？
Hah!
哈！
It’s just that easy for you, huh?
你覺得這是件容易的事？
You’re right, of course. Just took me a lot more mulling it over to get to that point.
或許你是對的，但以我目前的理解，我不認為能就此結束。
I’m calling this whole thing off. It’s stupid and I’m not playing that game anymore.
沒錯，我不想再玩這種愚蠢的家族競爭遊戲了！
I’m going to collect my badges, do my best in the Championship, and then I’m leaving.
但我還會收集徽章，在競技大會中拼盡全力，然後想去哪兒就去哪兒。
You can tell Mavis whatever you want. She’ll offer you a job at her side.
不管你想怎麼跟梅維斯說都可以，反正她會給你安排好一切。
Take it or leave it, your choice. But I’m out.
你怎麼想那是你自己的事，但是我已經決定了。
Thanks. Gonna need it, honestly.
謝謝，老實說，這句話才是我真正需要的東西。
Yeah. Sure as anything.
沒錯，再無回頭的可能。
Ha. Maybe, yeah.
哈，也許吧。
But I’d rather be called a yellow-bellied spoilt rich kid than Mavis’s second-favorite.
我就算被稱為一個懦弱的紈絝子弟，也不想成為梅維斯的“第二重要”。
Gonna be honest: don’t really care. Like I said, you do what you want.
隨意吧，我不太在乎。就像剛才說的，你自己愛咋樣咋樣。
But, yeah, I’ve been thinking about this for a while, and that whole debacle back there with Samorn… I’m out.
但...總之，我已經考慮很久了，包括剛才的混亂...我都退出。
I’m not gonna do the whole edgy trainer pushing as hard as possible shtick.
我不想做什麼極端的訓練家，我只想盡可能地提升自己。
I do really hate you sometimes, but that’s siblings for you.
有時候我真的很討厭你，但這或許就是兄弟之間的關係。
Had a Hymnus to try out against you, too. Shame.
本來還想用Hymnus和你對戰的。真遺憾。
…Bye, \PN. I’ll see you around. Good luck… saving the world, or whatever you’re doing.
再見了，\PN。也祝你…拯救世界也好，或者正在做的其他事情也罷，一切都順利，好運吧。。
These ruins are old, but not as old as the mountain itself.
這些遺蹟再古老也比不過這座山。
Whoever they were, they must have dug extensive tunnels with pre-industrial technology.
所以也就代表了，古人擁有非常先進的挖掘技術。
Either that, or something powerful created an entire mountain on top of them.
總不至於是什麼強大的力量，將這座山蓋在遺蹟上的吧！
Wheewie, this whole Regigigas thing-y going on here is a whole kerfluffle and a half!

它們所呈現出的那些，蘊含著歷史影響的謎團...
I couldn't bring myself to leave, even when the Team disbanded.
即便我們的隊伍已經解散了，我也不想就此離開這裡。
Ow! Oh, don’t you worry. I’m only bruised.
哎呀！哦，別擔心。只是輕微擦傷而已。
Is that the badge my grandma gives out? That means you beat her right?
那是我奶奶發的徽章嗎？這意味著你打敗了她，對吧？
That's hype! When I get better, I'm gonna find you for a rematch.
太棒了！等我變強了，我會找你復仇的。
If I'm gonna inherit the Gym one day, I'll have to be able to give Trainers like you a run for their money.

Hello, \PN.
你好，\PN。
I’m sorry. I’ve invited you here under false pretenses.
很抱歉，我用一個假借口把你騙來這邊了。
In my research I noted you and a certain individual meeting several times.
在研究過程中，我注意到了一個跟你有過幾次交集的人。
I would later discover her to be the former Champion, Yezera.
後來才發現她是前冠軍葉澤拉。
I have reason to believe she is behind the emergence of the avatars.
我有充足的理由相信她就是化身出現的幕後黑手。
I understand you may be unwilling to part with any information you have concerning this. I suggest a duel.
我知道你可能不願意透露太多，那我們不妨靠決鬥來決定吧！
The loser will tell the victor the whole truth.
輸家要向勝者透露全部真相。
Good.
很好。
That may be so. Dedicated trainers seem to have some kind of honor to their matches, though.
或許吧，但對訓練家來說，這樣的比試也有關榮譽感不是嗎？
I would like to ensure you are telling me everything. It seems as if a loss may compel you to reveal what you would otherwise hide.
我想確保能得知我想要的一切，如果你輸了，我可能會問一些更深入的問題。
Those are my conditions. I will fight you before I have anything more to do with you.
這只是我的條件，在我們相互坦白前的戰鬥。
If you would like to leave, you may.
如果你實在不願意，我也沒有什麼辦法。
Yes. What honor compels you trainers is beyond me.
的確，我很難以自己的思維，理解你們訓練家的榮譽感。
I plan to uphold my end of the deal, though. I believe your bizarre code of conduct will force you to, as well.
我會遵守我們的協議，我同時相信你們奇怪的行為準則也會迫使你這樣做。
Now, if you would like time to prepare, or simply to escape, do so now.
所以，無論你需要時間準備，還是就此逃跑，趁現在吧。
If not, then we shall duel.
如果不需要，那就開始吧。
Go. I’ll wait.
好吧，我會在這裡等你。
I understand you are the current Champion. I am more skilled than you may expect, though.
我知道你是現任冠軍，不過，我比你想象中更強。
You returned. Are you ready?
你回來了，準備好了？
Yes, well, I suppose I expected this. The odds of beating a Champion were low.
是啊，我早就想到了，想打敗冠軍沒那麼容易。
I did the best I could, and now I will tell you the whole truth. Maybe your response will tell me what I want to know.
我已經盡力了，願賭服輸，現在我會告訴你全部真相，也許你的迴應也能告訴我我想知道的答案。
I have discovered the locations of at least four of the five Regi tombs.
我已經找到四個巨人墓穴的位置了。
I am also aware of Yezera’s abduction of the Regis, and that some part of her plan has caused the avatars. My final finding is that... none of it matters.
我也知道葉澤拉帶走了它們，她的計劃導致了化身的出現，但我的最終發現是...這一切都沒有意義。
Not for my purposes.
對於我的目的來說沒有意義。
Makya is a large, vibrant ecosystem. The pressures which generate a new regional form are more complicated than one can simply infer.
馬凱亞擁有一個龐大且充滿活力的生態系統，這裡新的地區形態的出現，比人們的想象和推斷更復雜。
In my pride, I thought an outsider’s perspective could unravel this mystery.
或許是因為我的自負，以為以一個局外人的視角，能解開這裡的謎團。
The Regis, the avatars, the regional forms – all connected, of course, but not cleanly. The world is not a clean place.
巨人、化身、地區形態...我相信它們之間都有所聯繫，但這種聯繫又並不直觀，顯然這個世界並沒有那麼幹淨。
I am glad you agree. If you had a simple solution I had missed, I would be rather embarrassed.
我很高興你能認可，如果我忽略了什麼明顯的點...光是想想就覺得尷尬。
Even a negative result is worth determining for certain. I don’t have answers. I do have experience, and data.
即便是不好的結果，也值得大家去研究、確定，我雖然沒能得到答案，但積累了足夠的經驗和數據。
Yes. I plan to prove my abilities in more realistic ways than solving an entire region’s mysteries.
沒錯，所以我計劃，用比起解決地區的謎題，更為現實的方法證明自己的能力。
I don’t. I’ve determined my problem. Now I’m fixing it.
我並不會自責，現在已經確定了擺在面前的問題，只要一點點解決它就好了。
But I am also not finished, as I have only told you half the truth.
但即便如此我也沒有完成目標...我現在也只說了一半真相而已。
My challenge and this location were for a higher purpose.
我做這一切有著更高的目的。
I noted Makya’s vast diversity of species and set my sights on a particular trio. Prior to this moment, they have only been found in an extremely specific locale.
為了更加了解馬凱亞的物種多樣性，我把目光投向了它們三個...這三種之前只在一個特定地區出現過的精靈。
But, drawn by the sound of brutal conflict, in a place such as this...
可它們又為什麼被這樣一個 充滿殘酷衝突的地方吸引來呢？
Pulp and Fantasy
芳草與奇幻
Conflict against a hero such as you, in a location similar to their home such as this, draws them out.
在這樣一個類似它們家園的地方，與你這樣的英雄的一場對戰，正好能把它們吸引出來。
I have been untrue, however. I have fought you before. I was masked.
而且，我...還隱瞞了一件事，之前我...就和你戰鬥過...我戴著面具的時候。
I have determined I have made a mistake there, too. Primordial truth would elude us even if the world is reverted. There is no point.
但我已經認識到自己的錯誤了，就算世界恢復原初狀態，真理也會離我們而去，毫無意義。
The world is complicated, and always has been. My inability to solve such a relatively-trivial mystery suggests my plan was foolish.
世界一直都是如此的複雜...我無法解決這樣的謎團，也就此證明了我的愚蠢。
Please excuse my repeated deceptions. I did, in fact, determine quite a bit of this on my own.
請原諒我一而再的隱瞞，實際上...至少今天，我已經把該說的都告訴你了。
The nature of the regional forms is still a pursuit of mine. I plan to continue it, so Yezera must be stopped.
我會繼續研究地區形態的問題，這是我一直在做的課題，所以，請一定阻止葉澤拉。
If you wish, I would suggest you take these birds of the battlefield with you. I planned to use them against you. Now I suggest the reverse.
如果你願意，我建議你帶上它們一起，可笑我曾經還打算用它們對付你，但現在，完全反過來了。
I will leave you to your preparations. I have many years of study left in Makya, and plan to not waste them.
等你準備好之後，就來收下它們吧，我還會在這裡學習研究幾年。
I rest easy knowing you will not let my efforts be in vain. Goodbye, \PN.
將一切交給你我很放心，我知道你不會讓我的努力白費，再見，\PN。
There they are. Bringers of carnage.
它們就在這兒，帶來屠殺的使者。
Only a battle against a Champion in an environ similar to their home might draw them out, if they lurked here at all.
只有在類似它們家園的環境中，與冠軍級別的英雄戰鬥，才可能將潛伏在附近的它們引出來。
I have confirmed my hypothesis, and can rest easy.
當然這只是個假設，現在假設已被驗證，我也可以放心了。
If you wish to catch them, or merely fight them, you may do so. I will leave you to your amusements.
無論你想抓住它們還是僅僅與它們戰鬥，那就是你自己的選擇了。
Goodbye, \PN. Thank you. I have many more years of study left in Makya, thanks to you.
再見，\PN。謝謝你，多虧了你，我在馬凱亞的研究得以繼續下去。
Fine.
好吧
I'd tell you anyways.
本就沒打算隱瞞
No.
我拒絕
Seems unenforceable.
這辦不到
Give me a minute.
給我一分鐘
I'm ready now.
準備好了
That's true.
確實
So it was pointless?
所以就沒意義？
Pride is right.
自信很正常
Don't beat yourself up.

Leaving through -- oh. You -- you’re looking for something down here.
離開這裡...哦！你...你是在這裡找東西？
Come back and, uh, I’ll still be... around.
等你回來的時候...呃...我還會在這...附近。
I took some classes in the gym here.
我在這個道館裡補過幾節課。
I was a bit scared cause I heard how tough Samorn is.
一開始我有些膽戰心驚的，大家都知道賽蒙有多強。
She's the strongest gym leader in the whole region!
她是這個地區最強的道館館主！
But she's really nice. I had a great time.
但她平日很是和善，懸著的心終於放下了。
The door is locked shut.
門被鎖住了。
Samorn's House
賽蒙 家
Oh! I knew I’d find you here, my hero.
我就知道會在這裡遇到你，我的英雄。
You’re looking particularly ravishing today.
你今天看起來真迷人。
Your gaze is like a summer night... getting me all hot under the collar.
你的目光就像夏夜一樣...讓我感到又悶又熱。
Excuse my directness. I’m getting carried away. Hello, \PN.
抱歉，請原諒我的直白，我有點失控了...咳...你好，\PN。
Strange days. Strange days indeed! There’s an excitement in the air.
今天是個奇怪的日子！我能聞到空氣中的興奮感。
Oh, don’t flatter me. It’ll go straight to my head.
哦，別太誇我，我會驕傲的。
Aww, have I upset you? Please, I don’t mean a word of it, if that’s what you want to hear.
啊，我讓你感到難受了嗎？那抱歉，剛才的話都當是謊話吧。
...It’s been a long day. I get... flustered after days like these. Sorry.
...今天是漫長的一天，像這樣的日子讓我有點慌亂。
A certain trainer you may know grabbed me by the collar. Then she told me in detail what she’d do to me if I ever laid my hands on Yezera.
或許你也認識某個訓練家，她會抓住我的衣領警告我，如果我敢碰葉澤拉就怎樣怎樣的。
Now, as much as I might like to do exactly that... I haven’t. And won’t. She’s unattainable.
儘管我很想這樣做…但我並沒有出手，也不會出手，她是可望而不可及的。
Sorry, sorry. Let me explain myself. As much as I can.
抱歉，抱歉，讓我來儘可能地解釋一下。
Oh, for sure! She’s so appealing because of her reclusiveness. Oh, to rehabilitate her with endless kindness.
沒錯，當然是這樣！尤其是最後的選擇，真吸引人，用無盡的善意讓她慢慢恢復。
Who isn’t? So tremulous, so frail, yet so powerful. Don’t you want to hug her back to health?
誰不是呢？如此嬌羞脆弱，卻又如此強大...你不想擁抱她，讓她恢復健康嗎？
Oh, now, yes, of course. Don’t be jealous. You’ve got all her verve and aren’t as... high-maintenance.
誒呀，不要嫉妒嘛、你擁有著她所有的活力，而且...沒那麼難相處。
You see, I used to be obsessed with her. It’s why I’m here.
所以，這就是我曾經迷戀她，但現在出現在這裡的原因。
I could be the one to track her down, lure her out like a timid beast. I just wanted to take care of her.
我只是想照顧她，也願意成為那個追蹤她，像一隻膽怯的野獸一樣引誘她出來的人。
And she was beautiful, of course. I’m not so high- minded as to discount her graceful splendor as part of my reasoning.
當然，她也很美，我也不會高估自己的能力，不會將她優美的風度排除在我的行動之外。
But then I arrived here... and I found you. My attention was caught immediately.
但是當我來到這裡…發現了你，我的注意力立刻被吸引了。
I’m so sorry. I just can’t really contain my feelings any longer. I like you. A lot. And I’d like you to be mine.
我很抱歉，但我無法再控制我的感情了，我喜歡你，非常喜歡，我想讓你成為我的。
Shh. It’s OK. You’re confused and surprised and scared, but that’s alright.
你是覺得困惑、驚訝還是害怕？噓...沒事的，沒關係的。
What’s life without a little fear? Adds a little color to proceedings, doesn’t it?
沒有一點恐懼的人生算什麼？它為生活增添了一點色彩，不是嗎？
But I assure you my intentions are pure and loving.
我可以向你保證，我的意圖是純潔和充滿愛意的。
Don’t turn me away so easily, \PN. I know I’m a lot.
不要這麼輕易地拒絕我，\PN，我知道我...
I come on strong. Well, the incandescence inside my heart leaches out through my body.
表現得過於強勢了，將我心中的光輝透露出了太多。
I want you, and I want to be yours. I can’t hide it.
我想要你，我想成為你的人，我無法隱藏這份願望。
Oh, love, how I’ve longed to hear you say it.
我多麼渴望聽到你這麼說，這或許就是愛吧。
You’re beautiful when you smile, you know that? More gorgeous than an open sky. Deific in your grace.
你微笑時很美，你知道嗎？比開闊的天空更美麗，你的優雅神聖不可侵犯。
But I don’t want you to rush into this. Take your time. We can move slowly.
但我不希望你過於匆忙，慢慢來，我們可以慢慢前進。
\PN, I don’t want to be your friend. I don’t know that I even want to be your lover.
\PN，我不想成為你的朋友，我不確定我是否想成為你的情人。
I want to be with you. I want you to be mine, forever. I want you to be my crescent moon to illuminate my starless skies.
我想和你在一起，我希望你永遠屬於我，我希望你能成為我的明月，照亮我這片沒有星星的天空。
Here. Take this as a token of my boundless love.
拿著這個，作為我無盡愛意的象徵。
To show you I’m honest, and that I only want the best for you. This is the true color of my love for you.
為了向你表明我忠誠的心，以及我對你的予取予求。這就是我對你的愛的顏色。
Let this gift saturate your soul. Let it dye you with my affections. Let it be the start of our eternal romance.
讓這份禮物浸潤你的靈魂，讓它染上我對你的感情，讓它成為我們永恆浪漫的開始。
You’re amazing. Everything I saw in Yezera, in the avatars, even in the myths and legends, are all in you. You’re radiant. I want to bask in that radiance.
你太棒了，我在葉澤拉、化身、甚至神話傳說中看到的一切，都在你身上浮現，如此光輝璀璨，讓我忍不住想沐浴在其中。
Think about it.
好好感受吧。
I’d love you more than anyone else ever could. Go and take care of your material affairs. Your badges and your tournament – all those trivial things.
我會比任何人都更愛你，去處理你那些世俗的事務吧，把徽章、比賽什麼的都弄好。
And then find me. Somewhere... romantic.
然後來找我，在某個…浪漫的地方。
The top of a snowy mountain, overlooking the entire world. Beautiful. Stern and rugged and powerful. With an ancient soul.
在一座雪山的頂端，俯瞰整個世界，美麗、嚴肅、粗獷而強大，還擁有著古老的靈魂。
Just like you. Goodbye, \PN. I love you.
那一切就像你一樣美好。再見，\PN，我愛你。
Forever.
永遠不變。
Hello. My Druddigon and I handle trips down to Samorn's gym.
你好，我和我的赤面龍，負責在這裡幫助需要下去的人。
Stay away from the ledge and we won't have any problems.
這點高低差對我來說就是小問題。
Careful!
小心點！
If you've got a scheduled visit, I'm authorized to help you get down the ledge.
如果你想前往道館，我可以帶你從這裡下去。
...
。。。
You look like a Trainer.
你看起來是個訓練家對吧？
*sigh*
*嗤笑*
You're here too early.
但你來的太早了。
Samorn only takes the strongest of challengers, and you aren't strong enough yet.
賽蒙只接待最強大的挑戰者，顯然你還不夠格。
Go get all of the other badges first. Then you might be strong enough.
先把其他徽章都拿到手，然後才有這個資格。
My Druddigon and I handle trips down to Samorn's gym.
我和我的赤面龍，負責在這裡幫助想挑戰道館的人。
That service is for civilians, however.
不過這項服務是提供給平民的。
Trainers like you should know their place.
向你這樣的訓練家應該有自己的辦法才對。
Don't even think about challenging the Dreadnaught until you've aquired every other Makyan badge.
在獲得馬凱亞其他徽章前，就不要妄圖挑戰這裡了。
Oh, hello. I see you have some climbing gear.
嘿，你好，我看到你有一些攀巖設備。
I suppose that means you could go down to the gym on your own power.
也就是說你可以自行前往道館了。
I wouldn't recommend it. You still have a lot of growth to do.
但我不建議你現在挑戰，你還有很多其他事可以做。
Yes! You are the proper level of strength to challenge the Dreadnaught.
哈哈，你的實力已經足夠了。
I'm sure she will be pleased to battle you.
我相信她會很高興與你交手的。
You've bested the Dreadnaught! Well fought.
你打敗了無畏的賽蒙，很好！
My congratulations to you and your Pokemon.
恭喜你和你的精靈們。
You'd think that Samorn, the gym leader down there, would have issues getting around in her wheelchair.
你覺得賽蒙，也就是下面那個道館的館主，坐著輪椅會不會行動不便？
Especially in difficult terrain like this.
尤其是在需要爬坡下坡的地形。
At first I thought she'd use her dragons to help her down, but apparently that's too awkward.
起初我以為她會用自己的龍屬性精靈來幫她，但那也顯得太笨了。
Instead she just has her Runerigus do the heavy lifting. It isn't part of her team, so it gets to relax at home the rest of the day, too.
其實她一直用一隻迭失板來做各種重活，而這隻精靈並不在她的常規出戰列表裡。
"Attention: All Team Chasm Grunts"
"注意：所有裂隙隊員"
"Team Chasm is no longer in operation, and activities here are to cease."
"裂隙隊已正式解散，這裡的活動也將停止。"
"Until further notice, this base is now part owned by the scholars of Novo College."
"在另行通知之前，這個基地由望新學院暫時管理。"
"Your admins thank you for your dedication."
"感謝您的付出與奉獻。"
The 8th gym already. I can't believe how time flies.
已經是第八個道館了，真不敢相信時間過得那麼快。
I've been enjoying this. I really and truly hope that you have, too.
我一直在享受這個過程，希望你也如此。
Nothing like the search for perfection to motivate you to try crazy things.
沒有什麼比追求完美，更能激勵你去做瘋狂的舉動了。
Using species that are supposed to be extinct, for example.
例如，使用本已滅絕的物種。
I'm eager to try out this Arcanine, so hit me up post- haste!
我很想試試風速狗的實力，所以儘快來找我吧！
We could add to the history of this place by engaging in a struggle of training supremacy. You inclined?
我們要進行一場訓練至上的對戰嗎？為這裡的歷史添上濃墨重彩的一比！
Understood.
明白了。
I'll be here until you wish to battle.
你準備好了再來找我吧。
When I win, I'm gonna shout something very quotable.
如果我贏了，我一定得喊幾句名言警句。
Rock doggy.... no....
誒呀啊啊...不...
Heh, now I know how the grunts felt when Yezera whipped their butts.
呵呵，現在我好像明白葉澤拉在面對那些士兵時的感受了。
Leave me to the task of reviving my battlers.
讓我先復活我的戰士吧。
Vanya breathes out heavily.
凡雅重重地出了口氣。
So, this is it. The very last badge. After this comes the championship, you know.
就是它了，最後一枚徽章，之後就是競技大會了。
Even more than usual, I can't afford to mess this one up.
比起往常，這次更不能出錯。
Thank you for your help. Now it's just up to me to do what I've trained to do.
感謝你一直以來的幫助，現在輪到我去挑戰了。
Team Chasm HQ Gym
裂隙隊總部道館
Leader: Samorn
館主：賽蒙
History and motion.
歷史與行動。
Hey, kiddo. Knew you’d show up sooner or later. You took to training like a Wooper to water, didn’t you?
呵，小鬼，我就知道你會來，你應該跟烏波一樣適應環境了對吧？
Had to work myself to the bone to get here before you and, guess what? Gym leader’s out again.
為了在你之前趕到這裡，我不得不拼命往這邊趕，你猜怎麼著？館主又不在。
You waiting for me to throw a Poké Ball at you?
你在等我往你身上扔球嗎？
I’m not gonna. Not about to bruise my team just before challenging the gym.
我才不會做這種蠢事，在挑戰道館之前，我可不想降低隊伍的戰鬥力。
Yes, \PN. I snuck down here and put a sign on the door saying it’s closed after beating the gym, just to trick you.
你猜對了，\PN，我悄悄溜到這裡，在道館門上放了個關門的牌子，就是為了騙你。
It’s a flawless plan, really.
這真是個蠢到掉渣的計劃。
Not if you schedule in advance.
除非你提前預約。
Or that’s what I’d like to say – professionalism isn’t in this region’s blood.
或者我這麼說吧...這個地區的人都不怎麼敬業。
Don’t even get me STARTED on that man in the bayou. Insufferable.
總之，別再談這個地區的討厭鬼了。
In any case, Samorn’s out.
現在的情況就是賽蒙不在。
Sign on the door says she’s dealing with some ruckus over at the dig site. You coming?
門上的牌子說她正在處理挖掘現場的騷亂，你要一起去看看？
That’s what I thought. Let’s go.
這就是我希望的答案，走吧。
Oh, you want to be contrary, do you? Fine. Stay here and wait.
哦，你不想去是嗎？好吧，那你就留在這等著吧。
The dig site. West of town.
挖掘現場就在這裡西邊。
I swear, sometimes you’re more thick-skulled than a Rampardos. Let’s go perform some heroics, shall we?
雖說有時候你比戰槌龍還拗，但去做些英勇的事也沒什麼不好的，對吧？
The railway here used to be pretty nice, but it got destroyed when that girl took Team Chasm down.
以前這裡的鐵路相當漂亮，但從那個女孩擊敗了裂隙隊後，它就被摧毀了。
No one's ever really gotten to repairing the whole thing, too much hassle for too little gain.
然後就沒人願意修復它了，因為太麻煩，收益又小。
Most of the dirt and heavy equipment are already where they need to be.
明明大部分的泥土和重型設備已經準備好了。
Closed while Samorn participates in the Makya Championship Tournament.
馬凱亞競技大會期間閉館。
Hey, trying to get Samorn's badge as well? I've tried, but I've had no luck so far.
你也想獲得賽蒙的徽章？我之前試過，但一直沒成功。
I was prepped for countering a Sandstorm strategy, based on the legends I heard.
我明明已經根據收集到的情報，做好了應對沙暴隊的準備。
But she apparently hasn't used that strategy in forever, despite how well suited to it some of her Pokemon are.
但是她還有其他的戰鬥策略，即便她的精靈很適合沙暴天氣。
Maybe it's a "hiding your true power level" thing? I just don't get it...
或許這也是一種“隱藏真實實力”的方法？
You got the 8th badge? Damn, that means I gotta get myself one.
你得到了第八個徽章了？看來我也得找時間去拿一個了。
I want to at least make it to the Championship this year.
今年起碼去競技大會露個臉。
Um, hi?
呃...你好？
You're acting different.
你咋了？
Same to you.
我覺得你也是
You're a creep.
你好奇怪...
Wait, what?
你在說什麼？
Good for her.
她很棒
You're into Yezera?
你喜歡葉澤拉？
Eyes only for me?
跟我有關係？
Um.
......
Hell no.
不可能
I feel the same way.
我覺得可以
Can we be friends?
成為朋友？
Maybe later.
等會兒
Sure, let's go.
來吧
You kidding me?
你在開玩笑？
Happens a lot.
這種事經常發生
Of course.
當然
Nah.
不要
Where?
在哪裡？
[Map215]
[Map216]
Phione! \PN! What just happened here?
霏歐納！\PN！這是怎麼回事？
What? They can do that? Like, Phione BECAME an avatar? That’s insane!
什麼...他們竟然能...把霏歐納變成一個化身？
I’ve been trying to find Phione for hours now!
我和它幾小時前...分開了，我一直在找它！
And then when I finally do it’s you fighting it as a fricking avatar?
但是...終於找到的時候，你正在跟變成化身的它戰鬥？
Yeah! What’d you do? I mean – I’m not blaming you, but what happened here?
這...為什麼？我...我不是怪你，但是...這到底都發生了什麼？
OK, sorry, I get it. You’re confused too.
抱歉...我知道你也很困惑...
Phione was acting strange – standoffish, kinda hostile.
前不久，霏歐納突然變得好奇怪...它冷漠，還帶著濃濃的敵意。
Then it lashed out at me and bolted. I’ve been hunting it since then.
然後它對我發動了攻擊，然後就逃走了，我從那時起就一直在找它。
It looks OK now… you couldn’t’ve KO’d it any gentler?
現在...應該沒事吧...你不能...輕輕地...打倒它嗎？
Ah, it’s alright. No major scrapes or bruises – it’ll be fine. Just need to do some first aid…
啊，沒事的...沒有很嚴重的傷勢...它會沒事的，只需要治療一下...
I get that, but c’mon.
我知道，但是...
It’s obviously – I don’t know, possessed or something. Messed up in the head.
我..我不知道..它應該是被什麼佔據了...導致...頭腦混亂什麼的。
It’s not too bruised. Just need to do some first aid…
沒有很嚴重的傷勢...它會沒事的，只需要治療一下...
Well… yeah. Sure. It’s an avatar.
啊...也對，畢竟...現在它是一個化身。
Don’t pull your punches. Well, no harm no foul. Just need to do some first aid…
你沒有理由手下留情...還好，沒有很嚴重的傷勢...它會沒事的，只需要治療一下...
Insane. Complete insanity. It attacked me, turned into an avatar, attacked you…
這到底是怎麼了？為什麼，它會攻擊我？然後還變成化身，攻擊你...
What would’ve happened if you hadn’t beaten it?
如果你沒有打敗它又會發生什麼...
Ah, no use thinking about it. I just… I feel terrible. I feel just awful, because honestly I’m relieved.
啊...想那些也沒用...我只是...一時...我感到很糟糕，但這樣也好。
Because if it wasn’t an avatar, then it just left. It just left me. It hated me.
如果它沒有變成化身，就選擇攻擊我，離開我...
Yeah. Because at least it didn’t really hate me. It didn’t leave me.
也就是說，它並沒有恨我，並沒有因為討厭我才離開。
It’s hard. I was so afraid that it’d just left me that anything else is, like, a breath of fresh air.
我好怕它會離開我...
Well… we’ll see. Hopefully it’ll wake up and this’ll all be a distant memory.
還好...它會醒來的，這一切都會過去的。
Something we can laugh about, yeah?
將來或許還會成為笑談，對吧？
And… damn, I keep bringing you into this?
而且...我總是把你牽扯進來...
You gotta bail me outta everything. Well, thanks.
謝謝你做的一切，謝謝。
Here. I’ve had these for a while, but I don’t really need them now. For one reason or another.
這個給你了，出於某種原因...我已經不再需要它們了。
Doesn’t really make us even, but thanks.
當然這不足以報答你的恩情，權當我微不足道的謝意吧。
I need to get Phione somewhere safer, but I’ll see you. Thanks for everything.
現在我得帶著霏歐納去安全的地方了，我們還會再見的。
North: Cave of Hatching
北：啟明之窟
East: Frostflow Farms
東：風霜農場
Have you seen my new avatar defense technique? Pokésand, go!
要見識一下我抵禦化身的新招數嗎？寶可沙，出擊！
Hmm, back to the drawing board on this one.
嗯，看來還需要重新設計。
The technique is for avatars, not Trainers. I can't expect it to work perfectly here.
這個技巧是針對化身的，不是針對訓練家的。我不指望它在對戰中也能完美髮揮。
Huh? Weather wars? What's that?
啥？天氣戰爭？那是什麼？
Hey! It's uh... the guy you saw near the Regice Chamber.
哦，你是...我在雷吉祕室看到的那個人。
I think I got a decent understanding of what's happened to me.
我或許多多少少對自己身上發生的事情有些瞭解。
Whatever I was, it kept me separated from the world for a while. A lot has changed.
無論我到底是誰，它都讓我暫時與世界隔絕了，這讓很多事情都發生了變化。
Team Chasm is done. People have moved on, though not totally.
裂隙隊已經走到了終點，人們應當向前看了，儘管很多人不這麼想。
Rangers got me set up good. I have a lot of old friends that thought I was dead. They were more than happy to help me when I showed up.
義軍們把我安置得很好，很多老朋友都以為我死了，但我出現時，大家都願意幫助我。
In a way, Hoopa really did help me. Got to skip out on some of the rough parts of Team Chasm breaking up, and I'm taken care of.
不得不說，胡帕在某些方面幫了我，我躲過了裂隙隊解散時的一些麻煩，還得到了不錯的照顧。
I'm... ok. In a weird way. But that's life for ya, huh? It's all weird, and then it isn't. And you're ok.
我的生活方式很奇怪？但這就是生活，儘管奇怪，只要過得好就可以了。
That's life. Weird, but you're ok.
這就是生活，奇怪，但又合適。
That's a nice feeling, you know?
你不覺得這種感覺很好嗎？
How are you... here? This isn't even the right map... I don't actually exist. Sort of, at least... Please... don't cheat when we fight...
你怎麼……在這裡？這甚至不是正確的地圖……我並不真正存在。至少某種程度上……請……別在對戰時作弊……
Stop that
別這樣。
Sheeeeeeesh, let's get a looksie at this this little Trainer now!
哦哦哦，快看這個小訓練家！
Well butter my butt and call me a biscuit, this here Trainer's got us slapped silly!
好吧，你可以隨便給我取外號，竟然被這樣打敗了！
What a howdown from our Trainer friend here. Bet they got one o' those fancy candy thingamajigs.
我們的訓練家朋友真會說話，想必一定吃了不少糖吧。
A Pokemon world, and within every battle, a world of struggle.
奮鬥與競爭，在精靈的一生，多少敗與成。
How much can I fit, into a haiku format? I'm running out of...
俳句的格式的確很嚴格，能塞的東西有限...
A loud crashing lake, Chatot chirp in the distance, they sing united.
湖畔水聲漾，與聒噪鳥的清嗓，一曲共頌唱。
I write, erase, rewrite. Erase again, and then, my Ditto changes.
一字一音替，不知不覺日偏西，百變怪作筆。
You can barely make out the outline of a cave entrance behind the waterfall.
勉強可以透過瀑布，看到後面洞口的輪廓。
Well golly me we got a cheater! Looks like they did a little bit of hackerooni.
我們遇到作弊高手了！他絕對用了什麼黑客技術。
Well I ain't never seen a scrap like that since before my pa started herding Tauros with his bare hands.
除了我那個徒手跟肯泰羅較勁的老爸，我已經很久沒見過這種廢物了。
Real shame what happened to his favorite knee.
真是恥辱啊！
Heya, Trainer!
嗨，訓練家
I heard that a Champion was going to be here, but I coulnd't find them.
我聽說有個冠軍要來這裡，但我找不到人。
I even brought a Krabby to throw at them and everything! I stole it from a Ranger when he wasn't looking.
我甚至還趁義軍不注意，偷了只大鉗蟹想扔向他！
If I can't throw it at someone important, I'll sell it to get some ice cream!
如果見不到冠軍的話，那就把它賣了去買冰淇淋吧！
$5000! That'll get me ice cream for a week!
$5000！我就可以連續吃一週冰淇淋了！
You're lucky you're a nobody, otherwise I'd throw it at you.
你應該慶幸自己沒什麼名氣，不然我就要用大鉗蟹扔你了。
Done deal Trainer!
交易完成，訓練家
\PN hands over $5000 in exchange.
\PN將$5000交給對方。
Maybe I'll get chocolate today...
要不還是去買巧克力吧…
Haha, you're poor! That's really funny!
哈哈，窮鬼，嘿嘿！
My Pokemon love the trees and grass. They also love battling!
我的精靈們喜歡樹木和草叢，也很喜歡戰鬥！
What's that, my Pokemon? You want to go to the pub?
我的精靈這是...想去酒吧？
I have no choice, I must listen to them. Bye bye!
我只能聽它們的了，再見！
Good battling! You should fight my brother, too. He's all the way at the end of the river.
打得不錯，或許你有興趣跟我哥也來一場，他就在這條河的盡頭。
...
。。。
You're cheating, right?
你在作弊！
I'm just here to play my guitar. No idea who the other guy is...
我只是來彈吉他的，根本不認識那個人...
Welp, I'll have to abandon my Cave of Hatching visit...
看來我不得不放棄前往啟明之窟的旅程了...
The entrance is blocked, and I stupidly didn't bring any climbing gear.
入口被堵住了，我也沒帶什麼登山裝備。
If I did, I could have climbed around, but alas.
不然我就能直接爬過去了。
All I wanted was to experience the legend...
我只是想去體驗下傳說中的...
Take this item, I'm clearly not worthy of it...
把這個拿走吧，我不配...
It was an avatar.
這是個化身
You're here?
你也在啊
You're asking me?
你問我我問誰
Sorry.
抱歉
It was attacking me.
它也會攻擊我
Could've. Didn't.
可以但我不這麼打算
Why?
為什麼？
That it was possessed?
你覺得它被附身了
Don't beat yourself up.
不要自責
No thanks.
不用了，謝謝。
I'll take it.
我會收下它。
[Map217]
Looks like the Trainer ahead is moving to block you from going any further.
前方的訓練家顯然不會允許你通過。
Do you want to approach them? It looks like a tough fight.
要貿然靠近他們嗎？這將是一場惡戰。
I knew you would arrive, should I only wait.
我就知道你會來這裡。
Excuse the charade – I would prefer my identity remain enshrouded in mystery for now.
至於這份偽裝，請別在意，目前我們還得隱藏身份。
All that you are required to understand is who I serve – Yezera. Under her profound guidance, we have achieved our goals.
你只需要知道我們為葉澤拉工作，並在她的指導下，一步步完成我們的目標。
The titans have served their purpose. I come then with a simple inquiry: will you not listen to my reasoning?
這次行動已經結束了，而我等在這裡只是為了問一句，你願不願意聽一下我們的理由。
Thank you. Our goal is naught less than a complete reordering of the world.
謝謝，我們的目標，不僅僅是為了重構這個世界。
My comrades have their own motives, but mine is simple.
每個人都有自己的動機，而我的願望很簡單。
The world at present is mercurial and deceptive. Human culture and technology serves as naught but a veil disguising ultimate truth.
目前的世界充滿了欺騙與變化，人類的技術與文化，都在掩蓋本應被大家知曉的真相。
Only the realm of ancient myth, tended by gods, untouched by humans, might let us perceive it.
只有古老神話的領域，在神靈守護中，未曾被人類觸及，才得以讓我們觸碰到真實。
Do you not agree?
你覺得呢？
How disappointing, to dismiss it outright.
你竟然直接否定了這一切。
If you have no eye for truth, then we have nothing else to speak of.
既然你沒有看清一切的眼光，那也就沒什麼可說的了。
Forgive me this act of passion, but I expect a titan’s wrath may settle my raging heart.
請原諒我的情緒波動，但巨人的憤怒將會撫平這一切。
Regirock, heed my command.
雷吉洛克，聽我號令。
To the contrary: it has adamant support, if only one ruminates on the matter.
只要人們肯深入思考，就會發現這一切是對的。
Such wavering faith is nigh-useless for my purposes, alas. We require unflinching devotion.
但這種滿是動搖的信仰對我的目的沒有任何作用，我們需要更加堅定的信念。
*sigh* I would be forsaking my duty if I did not stall you at the least. Prepare yourself.
*輕笑聲*為了履行我的職責，起碼要拖延你前進的進程。做好準備吧！
I should encourage you to do so. Judge the weight of the world that is against the world that could be.
我很高興你願意這樣做，去評估世界的重量，對比真實與虛偽。
Alas, I know you will not ruminate idly upon it. You are a threat. That is intolerable to us.
但我不會就這樣等著，現在的你仍是威脅，我們無法容忍的威脅。
This shall be no decisive victory of mine, but I cannot let you pass unhindered.
我知道想要贏你並不容易，但也不能讓你輕鬆通過這裡。
…I should very much like to believe you.
...我也很希望能相信你。
If you speak truth, then I bid you repeat your convictions to Yezera herself next you meet.
如果你真是這樣想的，那下次見到葉澤拉時，請重複你剛才的想法。
She can see the machinations of your heart more clearly than I. Until then, you remain a trainer, as do I.
她比我更擅長看清別人內心的陰謀，但現在我們仍然是對手。
My enemy I smite, my ally I train. To either, en garde.
而對手，就是要擊敗的。
If you will not listen to my entreaties, then you are beyond salvation.
連最基本的傾聽都不願意，也就代表你已經無藥可救了。
Alas. Perhaps a titan’s fury will enlighten you to the clarity of the ancients.
唉，或許巨人的怒火，能讓你清晰地認識到這一切。
G’afternoon. Took your sweet time showing your face ‘round these parts, didn’t ya?
下午好，沒想到你現在才趕到這裡。
Listen, I ain’t ‘bout to preach to ya. Just want to make some things clear ‘fore we fight.
首先，我並不是想說教，只是希望能在戰鬥前澄清一些事情。
‘Cause we’re gonna fight. Ain’t no other way to it.
雖然無論如何都得打這一架...
Thank you kindly. I ain’t real interested in this cloak- and-dagger charade.
非常感謝，其實...我並不喜歡這種裝扮...
I’m with Yezera, always.
我只是一直在幫葉澤拉做事。
Listen, I’m only gonna say this once: you oughta hear her out.
注意，我只說一次：你應該去聽聽她的意見。
Don’t care if you agree with her. Just hear her out.
無論你是否認可她的想法，只是去聽聽，應該不難吧。
And if you hurt her, I’ll make you wish Mavis stopped after Zain. We clear?
但是如果你傷害到她，我會讓你輸給贊恩的，明白了嗎？
Cocky li’l brat, ain’t ya? Tsk.
真是個自大的傢伙。
What’s so damn infuriating ‘bout you is I ain’t just able to whip your sorry hide into submission. Too good.
然而讓我不爽的是，我沒辦法輕鬆擊敗你，你的確有些實力。
How ‘bout I try anyhow? Titan’s gotta be good for somethin’, right?
所以就來試試吧，看看巨人擁有怎樣的力量。
Good. I ain’t ‘bout ta repeat myself.
好的，我不想重複自己的話。
Now, I came here with a job to do, and I’m a reliable sort.
現在，作為一個可靠的同伴，我還是得完成自己的任務。
Sorry, kid. You’re a mite too fast. Gotta slow you down. Regirock, lead us off, will ya darlin’?
抱歉了，孩子。你的進度太快了，我得讓你放慢一些腳步。上吧，雷吉洛克！
Hah. Take it from someone who knows, kid: you ain’t even scratched the surface.
哈，我只能以我的經驗告訴你，你甚至連表面都還未觸及到。
I can make you plenty more miserable if I set my mind to it.
只要我想，我還能繼續拖你的時間。
But, cheer up, kid. I’m ‘bout to give ya what you always want: a good fight. Facing a Regi oughta cheer ya up. Heh.
不過，你應該想要一場優質的對局吧？面對雷吉洛克，或許能讓你振奮起來。
Nah, I ain’t about to trust that. Ya don’t know jack about me and Yezera.
哼，我才不信這句話！你根本不瞭解我和葉澤拉的事。
Bickering old married couple, that’s what we are.
我們已經是經常拌嘴的老夫妻了。
Want to show me you’re with us? Tell it to Yezera.
如果要證明你的想法，那就把這些想法告訴她吧！
For now, I ain’t too keen on letting you off easy. Sorry. Beating folks into the dirt is my job, after all.
但現在，我不會讓你輕易脫身的，將你打得落花流水就是我的工作。
Ah, well. Guess no matter how hard I try, old habits die hard.
呵，好吧，不管怎麼努力，老習慣還是不肯消停啊。
Speaking of dying hard – lay down and quit moving, will ya?
說到這裡...現在得請你消停一下了。
Hah. They ain’t never been happy with my way of goin’ about covert ops.
哈哈，他們也覺得我不擅長祕密行動。
Too rough ‘nd tumble. I ain’t built for cloak-and-dagger.
我行事太過直白粗暴。
So, let me tell you straight: you listen to Yezera. You hear her out. And don’t you dare hurt her.
所以，我就直白地告訴你了：去聽取葉澤拉的意見，傾聽她的想法，不許傷害她。
All I ask. And, uh, I wasn’t just sent here to chit-chat. You ready?
這就是我唯一的要求。當然我也不是來找你閒聊的，現在你準備好了嗎？
Hey. Fancy meeting you in a place like this.
嘿，在這裡相遇真是巧啊。
Oh, don’t look so angry – Regirock and I are here to fight you, but we’ll get to that.
哦，別動火啊，我和雷吉洛克就是為了打敗你而來的，但我們會先說清楚狀況。
I know you’re more than a pretty face. You’re smart. Care to hear me out?
我知道你不僅有好看的面容，還有著聰慧的大腦，所以能聽我說完嗎？
Aww. I knew I had a good feeling about you.
啊，我就知道你是個好人。
How do I explain it… well, I hate to use the word, but modern society is degenerate.
我該怎麼解釋呢…嗯...我不想用這個詞，但現代社會的的確確是墮落的。
We’re distant from the perfect moment of creation. We’ve kind of taken over the world.
我們遠離了神創造的完美世界，對一切掌握得過多了。
No respect for our elders – the primordial Pokémon that created the universe.
我們並沒有給予創造宇宙的精靈足夠的尊重。
Yezera’s going to reset this world back to its origins. And then humanity will be in the bosom of Arceus once more.
葉澤拉將會把一切回溯到起源，屆時人類將再次回到阿爾宙斯的懷抱。
Don’t call me insane. Although I’m sure this arrogant, faithless civilization would use that term.
不許用這個詞來稱呼我，這是傲慢又沒有信仰的文明才會用的墮落詞彙！
I’m merely devout, and devotion means making sacrifices. For example: you.
我只是虔誠而已，虔誠即意味著做出犧牲。就好比：你。
I really do like you, but… we all have to sacrifice sometimes.
我真的很喜歡你，但是...犧牲是絕對不可避免的。
Godlike Pokémon are now treated as not much more than beasts of burden.
那些神明一般的精靈現在都被看作是牲畜一般。
Avatars are destroyed at will because they’re “threats to humans.”
化身被肆意地摧毀，就因為它們是“對人類的威脅”。
The world has lost all respect, the divine essence from creation diluted and destroyed.
這個世界已經毫無尊重可言，神聖的本質被稀釋、破壞。
And since you seem to be no different, I can take some joy in this fight.
既然你也沒什麼不同，那就在這場戰鬥中獲得一些樂趣吧。
Arceus created the world. It is pure, and perfect, and resetting the world back to its original form will let us be pure and perfect too.
阿爾宙斯創造了這個世界，它是最純淨、最完美的，而重置後的我們也會變得純淨和完美。
I’d like to see myself blessed by the grace of our creator.
我想要得到神的恩典與祝福。
I’d like to see you that way, too.
我希望你也能得到這些。
In time.
時間差不多了。
For now, I’ve been ordered to slow you down. Shall we dance?
我接到的命令是拖延你的時間，那麼現在，我們開始跳舞吧？
Good. I knew I saw something in you.
很好，我知道你身上迸發出了什麼。
Some spark of faith. I’m a… very good judge of character.
那是一些信仰的火花，而我是一個...善於識人的人。
I’d love to just talk with you for a while, but I was explicitly instructed to stop you. So we’ll fight. Don’t take it personally.
我很想和你多聊一會兒，但我的任務是要阻止你，所以我們還是要對決，這跟我個人的情感無關。
Oh. Was I too forward?
哦，我太直接了嗎？
My emotions tend to get the better of me. I’m almost heartbroken.
我總是會被自己的情緒控制，我現在心都要碎了。
Well, I suppose I am a stranger.
也對，我現在是個陌生人。
Fortunately, I’ve been sent to slow you down, so I have a convenient vent for all these feelings of rejection.
好在我的任務就是來拖延你，眼前正好有一個方便的出氣口，釋放掉這些被拒絕的痛苦。
Hello, friend.
你好，朋友。
Business before pleasure: I have been sent to slow your progress.
我一直都是直來直往，我是來拖延你的進程的。
To that end, I am accompanied by a titan.
為此，我還帶了一個巨人。
Before we attend to that, however, may I interest you in a short, frank discussion?
然而，在我們處理這個問題之前，可以先向你介紹一下我們的立場嗎？
I would rather like to try to convince you of the legitimacy of our position.
我想試著說明我們的立場是正確的。
Thank you for your time.
感謝你的時間。
Yezera’s goal is to recreate the conditions of the world shortly following its creation.
葉澤拉的目標是重現世界誕生後不久的樣子。
Modern science has attained almost complete understanding and mastery over the world – the modern world.
現代科學已經幾乎完全理解和掌握了現在的這個世界。
It cannot, however, understand the past. By reverting existence, we may study the universe from its conception and obtain universal knowledge.
但是，卻無法理解過去。通過回到過去，我們就可以研究宇宙開始的概念，並獲得寶貴的知識。
This is the only way to do so.
這是唯一的方法。
Without the reversion, humanity will never attain complete understanding of the universe. It is worth all prices.
如果不這麼做，人類將永遠無法理解宇宙，這些代價是值得的。
Now our time for conversation is up, however. Regirock, please do the honors.
現在，交流時間結束，雷吉洛克，開始行動。
All persons who attempt to advance civilization should care.
所有試圖讓文明得以推進的人都應該關心。
Universal knowledge is a prerequisite for an all- powerful society.
知識普及是使文明進入新時代的先決條件。
That is my goal. That is the goal of all science: to know, and to apply that knowledge.
這是我的目標，也是所有科學發展的目標：理解，並運用那些知識。
Your ignorance implies discussion will get us nowhere. Let us dispense with such, then.
你的無知也就代表著，我們的討論不會有任何進展，那麼就沒有繼續下去的必要了。
Knowledge will be retained into the new primordial era.
知識將被保留到新的原始時代。
We can rebuild at least small enclaves of humanity.
我們可以重建人類的小聚落。
From there our analysis and conquest will begin: a new society with absolute knowledge.
並以此為基準開始分析與征服，並發展為一個擁有絕對知識的新社會。
And, stemming from this absolute knowledge, absolute power.
同時，還會因為絕對的知識，擁有絕對的力量。
Consider it. In the mean time, there is the business I mentioned earlier. Excuse me.
考慮一下吧，與此同時，我也該執行接到的任務了。
I am glad you have the wisdom to agree. If you should wish to support us in our endeavors, I will be happy to have you.
我很高興你擁有這份智慧，如果你願意支持我們的事業，我很高興能有你的加入。
We will fight for a more enlightened era. For now, however, I must slow you. Business is business. Let us commence.
我們將為一個更開明的時代而戰，但現在，我必須阻止你。任務如此，讓我們開始吧。
I find this highly unfortunate. You will be left behind by progress.
這並不是一個正確的選擇，你將被進步拋在腦後。
If you would prefer to retain your ignorance, however, I cannot help you.
然而，既然你自願保持無知，那我也無能為力。
Prepare yourself. Regirock, if you would.
準備好了嗎？雷吉洛克，出擊。
Oh. Hey.
嗨，你好。
Yeah, so, I knew you’d be here. Gym challenger, and, uh, all that.
哈哈，我知道你會來這裡，道館的挑戰者...等下！
…Welp. This is awkward.
…唔，有點尷尬。
How do I say this… you interested in hearing us out?
我該怎麼說呢…你有興趣聽聽我們的想法嗎？
We’ve kinda got the upper hand, but, y’know, don’t really wanna fight you. Whaddya say?
我們現在可是佔上風了，但是...你應該明白，我們不想與你敵對，你覺得呢？
Oh. That’s good. Great. Honestly didn’t expect that.
哦，那太好了！真的沒想到...
Well, I just figure we’ve done a lot of ordering Pokémon around.
我只是覺得我們不應該將那麼多命令強加給精靈。
Maybe it’s time to even up the footing a bit, y’know?
也許是時候讓我們站在同樣的地位上了，大概...
We can all kinda make up for whatever we did wrong.
我們有機會彌補以前所犯的錯誤。
The others have their reasons, but, uh, this is mine. Make a world where we can be forgiven. You get it?
其他人有他們自己的理由，但...呃...這是我的理由。創造一個我們可以被原諒的世界，你能理解我的意思嗎？
Well – fine. You know what? Fine.
好吧...你有自己的想法。
I don’t need your permission, and we certainly don’t need your help. Regirock. Do ‘em in.
當然，我不需要你的認可，也不需要你的幫助，雷吉洛克，幹掉他。
…You so sure? Takes a lot of pushing to train a team that strong in so little time.
...你確定？這麼短的時間內訓練出這麼多強大的精靈，這得需要多大的壓力啊！
But, yeah, no, I get it. Why would you help us?
但是，啊...我明白了，你並沒有幫助我們的理由。
Rich brat. Maybe we can beat some responsibility into you.
畢竟你是個富家子弟，你應該承擔起更多責任。
Uh. Don’t really know how to break it to you. You… don’t have time.
嗯，我不知道該怎麼說...你...沒有思考的時間了。
For one, we’ve already just about won. For two – think fast!
首先，我們已經快成功了，其次...我還有自己的任務。
Regirock, sweep ‘em off their feet!
雷吉洛克，把他解決掉吧！
Oh. Didn’t, uh, really expect that.
哦，沒想到會這樣。
Figured you were kind of a stuck-up brat. No offense.
我本以為你就是個自大的富家子弟...抱歉，請不要介意。
Well, good. Maybe we’ll be side by side one day, yeah?
好吧，也許有一天，我們會並肩作戰，對吧？
But, uh, for now… I’m supposed to fight you.
但是，現在...我應該和你戰鬥。
So, uh, sorry – ah, what am I saying, we live for this. Ready up.
所以，抱歉...啊，我在說什麼，都到這一步了...準備好了嗎？
Yeah, I guess that tracks.
哈，我覺得也會是這樣。
Fine. That’s… it’s fine.
好吧，沒關係。
I came here to beat the crap out of you anyways.
我來這裡就是為了揍你一頓的。
Odds are Regirock isn’t gonna stick around much longer, so let’s make it count. Try your best, eh?
雷吉洛克很快就要離開了，所以我要儘可能地利用好它。
…Hey.
嘿。
Tsk tsk tsk. I’m not gonna lie to you: I’ve been trying to plan this conversation in my head for the past hour.
呃...這個...我不會騙你：我已經在腦海中將這次談話了預演一個小時了。
But, um, you kinda interrupted me. So can I just say what I want to tell you?
但是，嗯...思路斷了...對，我能說一些我想告訴你的東西嗎？
Welp. Listen, uh, Makya’s kinda in a weird place right now.
嗯...差不多...呃...馬凱亞現在的情況很糟糕。
Team Chasm ran roughshod over this whole region and then kinda just… got away with it?
之前裂隙隊在這裡到處肆虐，然後就這樣...撂挑子走了？
So, uh, yeah, if you ever wanted proof that humans can’t get even the most black-and-white justice right, there you are.
所以，這就是人類甚至連正確分辨是非善惡都做不到的最直接的證據。
Would’ve been simple to fix that little screw-up. But they didn’t.
本來很容易就能處理這些問題的，但他們沒有這樣做。
So we’re taking the power away from humans, and putting it in the hands of Pokémon.
所以我們要把權力從人類手中奪走，交到精靈手中。
Is it? Is it!
啊？這就是答案嗎？
Am I insane for wanting some damn PUNISHMENT in this world?!
我就是希望他們得到應有的正義審判，是我的問題嗎？
Well, guess what. If people won’t give me it, I’ll MAKE it.
行，無所謂了，既然大家不願這麼做，那我就自己去審判。
And I’ve got just the tool!
而我有很好的幫手！
It is simple, you – you idiot!
這明明很簡單，你...你個白痴！
I can track down every ex-Chasm criminal and haul them up to the courts myself if I have to!
只要想這麼辦，我可以把每個裂隙隊成員，親自拖到法庭上受審。
They just won’t do anything if I did! So I have to do things personally, yeah?
但他們什麼都沒有做！所以我必須親自去做這一切！
Sorry. Nothing… personal.
抱歉，這不是個人恩怨。
Yes!
沒錯！
They’re noble and pure and – and – and they’d never let me down!
他們高貴而純潔...他們永遠不會讓我失望！
Unlike you! And everyone else around here!
不像你！還有你周圍的每個人！
You want to see? C’mon. See what kind of justice Pokémon can give!
要見識一下嗎？看看精靈能給出什麼樣的正義吧！
Oh. Ah-hah.
哦，啊哈。
Kinda got myself a bit worked up there… welp, no harm, no foul, yeah?
咳咳...有點激動…不過無傷大雅。
…Nah, that’s stupid.
…不，還是丟臉...
I’m not gonna waste this chance. I’ve got a Regi. You’re a prodigy. Let’s RUMBLE!
無論如何，我不會浪費這個機會，畢竟手裡有一個巨人，我們來戰吧！
Urgh, you make me so mad!
你讓我很生氣！
Nobody will frickin’ listen to me!
沒人聽我說話！
Fine.
好吧。
Y’know, fine, whatever.
好吧，隨你便。
You get what everyone else I fight gets. What you deserve.
你會在我這裡品嚐到應有的失敗！
Regirock – your watch is over. If you would go, then go.
雷吉洛克，你的任務結束了，你可以憑自己的意願離開了。
So it returns to its resting place… no matter. It has done all I desired and more.
它現在回自己的安息之地了...但它已經超額完成了我的目的。
As for you, we shall meet again.
至於你，我們會再見面的。
Farewell, and do not pursue me. Fate and fate alone will dictate when we next speak.
再見了，不要跟過來。命運將會決定我們何時再相見。
Regirock’s damn well spent. Flighty li'l things never like to be outside their tombs too long.
雷吉洛克的任務結束了，這東西並不喜歡在墓穴外待太久。
Ah, well. Got what I came for anyhow.
反正我已經得到自己想要的了。
Let me tell you one last word of advice. You hurt Yez, I’ll find you. And it won’t just be for some play fight with animals.
最後再給你一句忠告，如果你傷害了葉澤拉，我會立即來收拾你。
G’evening, kid. I’ll see ya around. Make sure I don’t hafta hurt you too bad when I do, ‘kay?
晚安，孩子，我們還會再見的，當我們再見時，希望不是你讓我怒不可遏的時候，好嗎？
Au revoir, Regirock. Enjoy your entombment, I suppose.
再見了，雷吉洛克，享受你的安寧吧。
And as for you, that was an exciting fight. You’ve got my heart pounding.
這真是一場激動人心的戰鬥，你讓我感到心跳加速了。
If you want to join us, come find Yezera. And if not, well, we’ll meet again. I’m looking forward to it already.
如果你想加入我們，就來找葉澤拉吧。即便不想，我們也會再相遇。
So long.
再見。
I surmise Regirock will now return to its tomb.
我想雷吉洛克應該回它的墓穴裡面去了。
The titans are temperamental and ill-suited to existence outside their crypts. It is of no matter.
巨人們的情況很特別，不能長時間待在墓穴外，不過這不重要。
We have all but succeeded in our plans. This was a courtesy.
我們的計劃已經成功了。
I will take my leave now. Thank you for your time.
我現在要走了，謝謝你的時間。
There it goes. Back to where it came from.
它走了，回它來的地方了。
Well, didn’t really expect to win anyways. Just wanted to slow you down, and, uh, I did.
嗯，我本來就沒指望能贏，只是想拖延你的時間而已，並且也做到了。
So… bye. We’ll do this again sometime. I’m out.
那麼...再見。希望我們有機會能再來一次。
*sigh* Buh-bye, Regirock. We don’t really, uh, need you anymore, I guess.
*嘆氣*再見了，瑞吉洛克，我想你可以回去了。
It was fun while it lasted… welp. Nothing lasts forever.
很有趣的一段經歷...好吧，沒有什麼是永恆的。
Speaking of! Hopefully next time we talk it’ll be in a fair world!
希望下次，我們能在一個公平的世界裡交談！
If it isn’t, then, uh, I’ll give you a run for your money, ‘kay?
如果不是的話...那麼...大概...我會讓你付出代價的。
Toodles. And don’t you dare follow – I’m playing hard to get, so respect it. Hah!
再見了，不要試圖跟著我...請尊重我不想暴露身份的意願，哈！
For most of Sweetrock's history, we've relied on Clefable teleportation to get cargo from the factory to the docks.
多年以前的蜜巖港，都是靠皮皮的傳送能力，把貨物運到碼頭的。
We got these conveyor belts installed a few years back, so the cliffside isn't an issue anymore.
最近幾年我們安裝了傳送帶，為貨物的運輸工作提供便利。
We still have to rely on teleportation to get in and out of the harbor, though.
當然，皮皮們並沒有因此失業，現在依然需要它們的傳送能力。
It's the bottom of a conveyor belt. It'd be impossible to climb up.
這裡是傳送帶的底部，爬不上去的。
The ocean to the east brings calming winds.
寧靜的海風從東邊吹來。
But why? We might explain it with ocean currents, or weather patterns.
但這究竟是為什麼呢？根據氣候和洋流我們能得知風向的成因。
But what makes the winds here calming? Of that, I am not so sure.
但究竟是什麼原因，讓這裡的海風變得如此寧靜呢？
More than a million years ago, a meteor struck this area of Makya, plowing through a large mountain to the west.
百萬年前，有顆隕石從天而降，撞上了馬凱亞的一座大山。
That large mountain became two smaller mountains, which we now know as Split Peaks.
巨大的衝擊力將其一分為二，我們現在管那裡叫嵌口峰。
The impact site itself would fill with water and become Sweetrock Harbor.
而被直接撞擊的地方，則逐漸被海水灌滿，並變成了今天的蜜巖港。
I really want to know who that was in the weird outfit.
我很好奇那些奇裝異服的傢伙到底是什麼人。
Well, regardless, thanks for kicking them out of town.
總之，謝謝你幫我們把他從這裡趕走了。
I'm a firefighter, so I'm used to dealing with issues...
我是一名消防員，我習慣地幫大家處理問題...
But "Cultist with a Regirock" is outside of my job description.
但“帶著雷吉洛克的怪人”不在我的職責範圍內。
I've been biking across the entire region over the past few months.
我花了幾個月的時間，靠騎自行車走遍整個馬凱亞。
Crossing the Split Peaks was by far the hardest part.
其中最難的部分就是嵌口峰。
The view from these cliffs, and the feeling that I've finally accomplished my goal, made it all worth it.
但當我從懸崖上眺望遠方，將一切盡收眼底的那一刻，感覺一切努力都是值得的。

Sweetrock Candy is sent all over the world, but more than 30% ends up in the Galar Region.
蜜巖港的糖果被運往世界各地，其中30%以上都流向了伽勒爾地區。
Those people love their candy.
那邊的人更喜歡吃糖。
I work at Sweetrock Candy factory, like many in town.
我像這裡的很多人一樣，在蜜巖糖果工廠工作。
That said, I rarely get to see Victoire, the manager and gym leader.
但是我很少見到老闆，也就是道館館主薇克特爾。
I gotta rely on rumors to know what her team is like.
連我都只能通過傳言來了解她所擁有的精靈。
Some of them are a bit hard to believe.
其中一些流言讓人覺得離譜。
I heard some people saying that she uses a Rainstorm strategy.
比方有人曾經說，她用的是“暴雨策略”。
With Fairy and Steel-type Pokemon? How does she manage that?
可是妖精和鋼屬性的精靈，怎麼用所謂的“暴雨策略”？
Huh, you really beat her, then?
哇，你打敗她了？
You gotta tell me what she's like as a trainer.
你能告訴我她的水平怎麼樣嗎？
My curiosity's grown too big!
我可太好奇了！
"Sweetrock Harbor, satisfying the world's sweettooth!"

How goes your journey, young master?
少主，旅程還順利嗎？
I've purchased a Clefable teleportation license, and reserved this pier for our use.
我們已經購買了皮皮傳送執照，並租借了碼頭的使用權。
We can travel to and from any of our usual locations.
這樣我們就可以快速往返於一些地點了。
Where will we be heading?
我們要去哪兒？
Shh... don't give away my hiding spot!
噓...不要暴露我的位置！
Is it... is it safe to come out now?
現在...已經安全了嗎？

Have you slid down the conveyer belts?
你從傳送帶上滑下來過嗎？
Preeeety sure we're not allowed to, but its crazy fun.
當然這樣做很危險，但也很好玩。
Maybe not as fun as beating the 7th gym will be, since I got a reason to use another Makyan exclusive 'mon!
不過還是去挑戰第七個道館更有趣，畢竟我已經拿到了馬凱亞的專屬精靈！
Which one? You'll just have to battle me to find out!
哪一種？打過就知道了！
I cannot convey to you just how much I want to battle. Heh. So, you up to doing so?
我都不知道該如何表達現在對戰鬥的渴望，所以，你準備好了嗎？
Understood.
知道了。
I'll be here until you wish to battle.
你準備好了就來找我吧。
Rock 'Em, Torterra!
去吧，土臺龜！
Damn, even the Dustox couldn't leave a dent in you.
唉，即便是毒粉蛾也沒辦法傷到你。
Think anyone in the lighthouse was watching our battle just now?
你覺得燈塔上的人會不會看到我們剛才的對決呢？
No way around it, I'll need some healing before we square off again.
沒辦法了，下次交手之前，還是先恢復下狀態吧。
Got a good look at Victoire, I take it?
你見到薇克特爾了對吧？
She as quirky as they say? I don't know why I bother asking. I'll be finding out soon myself.
她真的像別人說的那樣奇怪嗎？誒...明明我馬上也要見到了，為什麼現在還要多問一句。

[Map218]
A cap of rock is holding back a geyser of boiling water.
一塊巨石堵住了沸騰的水。
I was once considered a beauty, but the way of the water needed a disciple.
儘管我擁有著俊朗的相貌，但從水之道也需要虔誠的心。
I should dry off.
現在得擦乾了。
Legends say if I stay here for fourty day and nights, my inner qi will strengthen tenfold.
只要在這裡住上七七四十九天，我的內功就能增強十倍。
The way of the water is full of solice. Splash.
水之道，無常形，滋萬物，潤無聲。
\PN! You made it. Took some effort to find this place but... man. It was worth it.
\PN，你來了！雖說費了不少功夫才來到這裡，但...一切都值得。
What? My all-grown-up companion here? Yeah. It is.
什麼？你說它？沒錯，只不過成年了而已。
Sorry. Well, not sorry. You didn’t have to come. But you did. And I’m glad you did.
抱歉...其實也沒必要。你其實不用來這裡的，但我很高興你來了。
I think it’s soothing. I dunno, maybe I’m just a little more goth than I’d like to admit.
我倒是覺得這裡很舒服，或許我比想象中更喜歡黑暗？
The waters here are special. Not just ice-cold and way too deep for me to be comfortable, but they’re saltwater, too.
這裡的水很特別，又冷又深，而且還是鹹水。
Ocean water, trapped down here. And for some reason... it makes Phione transform into Manaphy.
或許就是因為這些被困在這裡面的海水，才讓霏歐納變成瑪納霏了吧。
I don’t know why, or how. I’m not that smart. But it does.
我不知道是怎麼回事，我本來就沒那麼聰明，只知道事實就是如此。
I don’t even know if it’s really evolution. It’s – I don’t care. I don’t care how it works, or what it is scientifically.
我也不知道這該不該算進化，反正我不在乎在科學上該怎麼解釋。
It’s a Manaphy now. And I’m damn proud of it.
重要的是它沒事了，而且現在是瑪納霏了。
Yeah! I mean, I think so, at least.
對，我就是這樣想的。
I can’t believe it. A Pokémon of actual literal myth and legends, here beside me.
我簡直不敢相信，自己能得到一隻真正的傳說中的精靈。
Oh. Uh, yeah, thanks.
嗯，謝謝。
Um. I didn’t really have a lot to do with it. Phione came down here, danced around in the water here, and then it just kinda... transformed.
其實我並沒有參與太多，霏歐納來到這裡後，就開始在水中跳舞，然後就這樣了。
Unbelievable. A Manaphy. I raised a Pokémon like this, all by myself.
我真的很難想象，自己竟然撫養了一隻這樣的精靈。
It’s a Pokémon from myth. Supposedly they live at the ocean floor and can befriend anything and anyone.
那時一種傳說中的精靈，據說生活在海底，並且可以和任何事物交朋友。
They’re not half-bad in a scrap, either. Truly just... amazing. An absolutely incredible Pokémon.
而且它們也很擅長戰鬥，真是神奇到令人難以置信的精靈。
And it’s my best friend. It doesn’t hate me, or resent me, or fear me. It chose to be with me, of all people.
最重要的是，它是我最好的朋友，它不討厭我，不恨我，不怕我。
It could’ve chosen anyone. It could’ve chosen you – you’re certainly a better trainer than I am.
它明明可以選擇任何人，比如說你，你肯定比我更好...但它最終還是願意跟我一起。
And, yeah, thank you, sincerely, for everything. You’re great. And you’ve really helped me. Thanks.
最後...真的...非常感謝你，這一路上你幫了我太多。
Hmm. Yeah, not good enough. Gonna need one last favor.
嗯...不過...我現在還有個請求。
I hope so! Not too many people have even seen one of these magical things. And fewer people have fought one.
我希望如此！另外...見過傳說中精靈的人很少，跟它們戰鬥過的更是。
Oh, we’re on the same wavelength. You know what it means.
哦，我想我們想到一處去了。
That’s right. One last showdown. You and me. My new Manaphy.
沒錯，最後一次決鬥，你和我，還有我的瑪納霏。
I’m gonna lose, I know. But I’m not going down easy, alright? You ready?
我知道我會輸，但我不會輕易放棄，你準備好了嗎？
Alright. Get ready. I want it to be a good one.
好的，準備好再來找我吧，我不希望留下任何遺憾。
I’ve never been happier to throw down against anyone.
我從來沒有像現在這樣期待與某個人決鬥過。
Manaphy’s debut. I don’t care if it’s good or bad. I just want to see it in action. Let’s do this.
瑪納霏的首秀...我不在乎它能不能表現好，我只想看到它戰鬥時的身姿，讓我們開始吧。
You good? I’m ready when you are.
你準備好了嗎？我隨時都可以。
Ah, wouldn’t have it any other way.
啊，看來就到此為止了。
You know, \PN, you’re a good friend. You don’t pull any punches.
\PN，我一直將你當成朋友，你從不掩飾自己的想法。
I never could beat you, and I’m never going to, but that’s OK.
我從來沒有打敗過你，或許永遠也做不到，但沒關係。
You’ve made me better. Helped me out. I hope I’ve helped you too. I really do.
因為你讓我變得更好了，你幫了我很多，我也希望能幫到你。
And, uh, yeah, I’m glad I met you.
能夠與你相識真是件幸運的事。
Good. I’m – yeah, that’s all I’ve ever really wanted. Manaphy’s happy, you’re happy, I’m happy.
這就是我一直想得到的，你，我，還有瑪納霏，我們都很慶幸這段旅程。
Sorry, that’s just who I am. Big ol’ bleeding-heart, I guess.
抱歉，我一直都是這樣，情感一直是我的第一驅動力。
Oh!
哦
Uh, well... I don’t know. I’ll think about it, OK?
呃...這...我不知道，我得考慮一下。
We’ll see each other around. I, uh... I dunno if I see you in that way.
我們還會再見的，我...嗯...我不知道再見時是否還可以像今天這樣。
You know. If you’re saying what I think you’re saying.
我想你應該知道我的意思...
...\PN, I really do care about you, though. You’re my friend.
...\PN，我真的很在乎你這個朋友。
And if you need me, I’ll be there, always.
如果你需要我，我會一直在這裡。
Well, maybe not always. I’ve got my Pokémon to take care of. But you know what I mean.
好吧，也許不是一直，我還要照顧我的精靈，但大概就是這個意思吧。
I’ve done some stuff I’m not proud of.
我曾經做過一些讓我覺得丟臉的事。
I’m gonna come clean: I’ve been working with Yezera on her plans for a while now.
我必須坦白：我和葉澤拉計劃這些...已經有一段時間了。
Never felt like I was good enough. Didn’t feel like anyone was good enough for the love we got from our Pokémon. But maybe that was just me projecting.
我不覺得自己是個好人，我不覺得有人能配得上精靈對我們的愛，但...這只是我自己的一種偏執。
Maybe I’m the asshole, y’know? And I’ve known that forever – I’m not that stupid – but it takes a wake-up call to realize it. And this was it.
換句話說，我就是個混蛋！我其實知道...自己沒那麼蠢...但我需要有誰來提醒我該做什麼。
So, yeah, if they want to ruin the world, they can do it without me. And you can stop them with a Phione at your side. Or a Manaphy now, I guess.
所以，如果他們要毀掉這個世界，根本沒必要來找我。並且，你可以和霏歐納...或者瑪納霏一起去阻止他們。
I’ll be thinking about you. Wishing you the best, now and forever.
我會以我的信念，祝願你能夠成功。
Thanks for all of it. If you need me, ever, all you gotta do is ask.
感謝你做的一切，如果你需要我的幫助，隨時都可以來找我。
Neither of us is finished, I know that.
我們還沒有結束這一切。
I’m gonna try again at becoming Champion next year, I think. Maybe.
或許，明年我會試著，成為這裡的冠軍？
Future’s uncertain. And you... you’ve got stuff to do, I know.
畢竟未來誰也說不準，你也有一定要去做的事不是嗎？
I wish you the best. I’m gonna be thinking about you, I know.
我會以我的信念，祝願你能夠成功。
And if you need me, you damn well better ask me, OK? You’ve taken a weight off my shoulders.
感謝你做的一切，如果你需要我的幫助，隨時都可以來找我。
See you around, \PN.
再見，\PN。
Is that...?
那是...
Tell me about it.
跟我說明一下
Creepy, isn't it?
這裡有些恐怖
That's great.
這樣就夠了
I'm proud of you.
太好了
What's a Manaphy?
瑪納霏是？
You're welcome.

Ah, hello. It’s good to see you again.
嘿，我們又見面了。
Do not fear: I have no new forms that need combat testing.
別擔心，這次我並不大打算再做新的精靈測試。
I am studying the biodiversity of Prizca’s underground. It’s...
我正在研究宏禮市下水道內的生物群系，只是...
That’s not inaccurate. The ecological pressures here are novel, to say the least.
這樣說也沒什麼問題，這裡的生存壓力出乎預料地大。
I am a biologist. We are accustomed to filth.
我作為一名生物學研究者，早已經習慣這種環境了。
If one has an aversion to creatures adapting to life in a sepulcher, then yes.
對於生活在城市中的一般人來說，的確是這樣。
Perhaps to a trainer. After all, you can catch your preferred selection here just as easily as in the open wilderness, can you not?
或許對於訓練家來說是這樣，畢竟這裡跟其他地方一樣，給你提供了很多可捕捉的精靈。
In any case, it is an understudied biome.
總之，這裡擁有著人們對其瞭解甚少的生物群系。
I had rather hoped to find it in pristine condition – as much as a sewer can be pristine – but the avatars have made that difficult.
我本希望能看到這裡原本的樣子...不過排水設施的存在也讓它原始不了。但最大的問題還是這裡的化身。
This entire region is undergoing dramatic ecological shifts. I have my concerns.
這個地區正在經歷劇烈的變化，我對此感到有些擔憂。
Yes. While avatars do not seem to eat or drink, and they do not prey upon other Pokémon, wild Pokémon still avoid them.
沒錯，雖然化身不需要進食，但它們的進攻慾望實在是太強了，野生精靈都會主動遠離它們。
They are, after all, quite large and threatening.
單是那龐大的身形，就已經是一種威脅了。
I noticed a lack of avatars when I went anywhere you’d been before. I thank you for that.
我也注意到了，但凡你去過的地方，化身就會消失，謝謝。
I fear a potential climate collapse. That is predicated on very unlikely outcomes, but it is still a sobering idea.

I plan to... well, I plan to ask them about their observations.
我計劃…嗯...詢問下他們對相關內容的研究結果。
And I would also like to determine if they’ve been performing their due diligence. I have my suspicions about their overall effectiveness.
另外我也想確定他們是否盡職盡責，畢竟現在這樣...很難不懷疑。
To say more at this point would be baseless slander.
當然，在只有猜測的情況下，我說得越多，就越是誹謗。
If you should happen to want to assist me, meet me there. In fact... I could use someone with a position of perceived competence with regards to battling.
如果你願意幫我，就一起去大學吧...而且我也需要一個足夠強的訓練家。
Could you seek me out after finishing your gym challenge?
大概...就在你完成道館挑戰之後吧？
Between your eight badges and my eight-year degree, I believe our conclusions would demand respect.
憑我的八年學位和你的八個徽章，他們肯定不敢隨意敷衍我們。

但是...不...算了。我已經給你添了太多麻煩，現在還是別再提出什麼要求了。
Goodbye, traveler.

I might be out of Pokemon, but if you try anything funny, you'll regret it.
的確，我沒有精靈可以出戰了，但你如果敢亂來，我會讓你後悔的！

I'm learning so much more than I ever did in school.
在這裡能學到的比學校裡多得多。
Like how to make a pipe bomb!
比如說如何製作雷管！
The stuff about "collective action" or "mutual aid" or whatever is nice too.
再就是關於“集體行動”或者“行業規則”之類的也不錯。

你發現下面正好有個精靈球，或許就是捕捉它用的。

You'll leave the Pokemon here for now.
你打算把它留在這裡。
As soon as you untie one of the restraints, the Pokemon breaks free from the rest.
你解開了其中一個束縛，它立刻就掙脫了其它束縛。
It seems like it wants to join you! Type: Null enters the Pokeball on its own.

Another child? Leave at once! If you don't, we won't hesitate to attack with our powerful Pokemon!

I see you've made it past the others.
看樣子你已經打敗他們了。
I'll give you one last chance to turn around.

Others may blame the Avatar of Maractus for that, but I don't.
有些人說這是化身，但是我不信。
Er, it definitely created them. But I'm too excited to see the cacti bloom to be annoyed!
呃...肯定是某些人種的！不過能看到它們開花，我也沒什麼意見就是了！

Thanks to your Pokemon, I'm always able to zap my TV every time the signal's bad.

Oh. Are you the one interested in the property?

I mean, I guess I can see why...
嗯...我大概明白了...
Hmm, I'll take that as a no.
嗯，我把這當作一個否定吧。
But yes, this property has been up for sale for a while.
沒錯，自這裡掛牌出售起，已經有一段時間了。
Not many offers though, due to the price and the state of it.
但由於價格和現在的狀況，並沒有多少人來問。
Excellent, I'll give you a rundown of the place.
太好了，我這就跟你介紹一下。
Obviously it's a fixer-upper. Place has been abandoned for years.
顯然，這是棟需要修繕的房子，畢竟已經很多年沒住過人了。
It's been a massive thorn in the side of my portfolio. I've been looking to dump it, but the prime location of it keeps the price up.
這就是出售這裡最大的難題，雖然我一直找機會推銷，但這裡畢竟是黃金地段，光是地皮的價格就很高了。
I suppose the type of people to move into this area aren't the type to want trashed places like this.
而想要搬來這邊的人，又不會想買這樣一棟房子。
Well, I don't know how you still feel about it, but at this point I'm willing to part with this place for $250,000.
現在的價格是$250,000，不知道你覺得怎麼樣。
That's absurdly low, but at this point I'm paying to keep otherwise stress-lost years of life.
這個價格已經很優惠了，如果不是實在不好出手...
It sucks to hear, but I suppose I can't blame ya.
這不怪你，畢竟...
Guess I'll just wait here until another interested party shows.
我只能繼續等下一個買家了。
Whoa! Well, yeah, there it is.

至於翻新...
We can talk about that. I know a few guys.

Find me at The Tunes, it's a cafe on the northeast end of town. We can talk about it there.
在這座城市東北角有一家叫“樂之家”的咖啡館，你可以在那裡找到我。
I don't see that cash you're talking about, so I'll assume that you don't have it.
你也沒能拿出錢啊。
No shame in that, just come back when you got the cash.

我是一名生物學家，研究世界上那些迷人的精靈。

偶爾會有人通過募捐精靈球把他們的精靈一併送給我們。

雖然我很感激這種慷慨，但這仍然很奇怪。
It also means we have to check the Pokeball donations to make sure they're empty!
所以我們必須檢查通過募捐手段拿到的精靈球，確保它們是空的！
We had some pretty uh....interesting scenarios before that policy.
至於為什麼需要這樣做...呃...以前出現過一些...很有趣的情況。
We've got too many Poké Dolls and Smoke Balls 'cause people keep donating them.
我們再募捐活動中，收到了太多的精靈玩偶和煙霧球。

任何願意幫忙應對化身危機的人都可以加入義軍。
They're pretty accomodating--anyone who signs up gets stipends for food and board.
現在的要求非常低，只要報名就有食宿津貼。
That being said, the new demand for housing means some of us have to stay in the bunks until a new place becomes available.

Those fools over at Aegis Insurance called and tried to convince us to register for "adventuring insurance".

To think, that they would try and pull the wool over our eyes with that scam.

If you got one of those Pokemon, I can trade you a Pokemon of mine. A Dewpider, to be specific.
如果你有這樣的精靈，我可以拿我的滴蛛跟你交換（在箱子裡選擇精靈）。

顯微鏡的載玻片上有一種奇特的礦石物質。
It's labeled "SP-883."
上面的編號是“SP-883”。
The ruins here date back thousands of years.
這裡的遺蹟可以追溯到幾千年前。
Much of it predates even the oldest areas of Prizca.
其中很多比宏禮市最古老的地方還要早。
Connecting the link between this society and Makya's has proven quite difficult.
想把這些跟馬凱亞的社會聯繫起來不是一件容易的事。
The region was decimated by internal and external conflicts during the end of monarchy, so much of the era's historical record has been lost.
在君王統治的末期，這個地區同時受到了內外的摧殘，很多歷史記錄都已經丟失了。
The microscope is prepared with a slide with a blindingly bright white powder.
顯微鏡的載玻片上，有一種亮得刺眼的白色粉末。
No
算了
Yes
試試

A huge variety of books line the shelves.
書架上的書籍琳琅滿目。
A colorful tome stands out: "Fairy Tales of the East." It looks heavily worn.
一本色彩鮮豔的書很是顯眼，那是一本看起來很舊的《東方童話》。
Samorne is in the other room, if you'd like to discuss matters with her.
你若你想跟賽蒙討論問題，她現在在另一個房間。
...hm? Who am I?
…嗯？我是誰？
Simply call me the Dragon Hatcher.
你可以叫我育龍者。
If you were looking for Samorn, I regret to say that she is absent.
如果你是來找賽蒙的，很抱歉，她不在這裡。
But perhaps you were looking for me, the Dragon Hatcher?
但也許你是來找我的？
I have raised every species of Dragon which can be found in this world--some for dear wife's team.
我幾乎孵化這個世界上可以找到的每一種龍，其中一部分是為了我心愛的妻子。
If you stumble across any Dragon Eggs on your journey, be sure to talk to me.
如果你在旅途中發現了龍蛋，可以隨時來找我。
Give them to me, and I will hatch them.
把龍蛋交給我，然後我來幫你孵化它們。
Don't worry--I shall then hand them over to you.
放心，我不會昧下的。
It's an honor just to bring more Dragons into the world.
能多孵化一些龍，就很知足了。
Would you be willing to entrust me with any Dragon eggs?
你有要給我孵化的龍蛋嗎？
Once born, I will hand the hatchling over to you.
孵化之後我會把幼龍給你。
I shall be patient, then.
那我繼續等待新的龍蛋了。

如果你想找到更多龍蛋，可以去廢棄的龍巢看看。
A small hole at the base of a rock wall signals the entrance.
在巖壁底部的小洞口那裡。
I have contemplated whether to share this with you.
我一直在考慮是否要分享這個故事。
My decision is that indeed I should.
想來想去，還是說出來的好。
I come from a line of monks who cultivate a harmonious existence on the Isle of Dragons.
我是一個出身於龍之島的道士，我們家族都是以此為生。
The island is a haven for 7 different lines of Dragons, serving to protect them from the greed of trainers.
那座小島上有七種不同的龍，那裡是它們的天堂，保護它們不被貪婪的訓練家侵害。
You have shown a love for all of these Dragons, and thus have earned my confidence.
你對所有的這些龍都表現出了熱愛，因此，我願意信任你。
You have endured many hardships in service of Makya, and thus have earned my confidence.
你為馬凱亞做了這麼多，歷盡艱辛，所以我願意信任你。
So I will share with you a secret: the location of the Isle of Dragons.
所以，我會告訴你這個祕密，告訴你龍之島的位置。
There is one in our group who can ferry you there immediately, if you wish.
如果你願意，我可以立即送你過去。
Would you like to be brought to the Isle of Dragons now?
你要現在去龍之島嗎？
Follow me.
跟我來。
I'm sure you will be capable of reaching the Isle with your own boat.
你應該有自己的船能到那裡吧。
May the winds be good on your journey.
祝你一路順風。
Greetings, fellow Master of Dragons.
你好，巨龍的夥伴。
Do you have more eggs which you wish me to hatch?
你還有需要我孵化的龍蛋嗎？
I won't say there exists such a thing as too many dragons.
我永遠不會嫌它們多。
But it is indeed possible to reach a state where one no longer feels the need for more.
但是，總會有到達極限的那天。
You find nothing within the wooden trash can.
木製垃圾桶裡啥都沒有。
The bed, despite its large size, has been made with care.
一張尺寸很大，並且製作得很用心的床。
A page is open about a particular subspecies of Exeggutor in Alola.
電腦上打開了關於阿羅拉椰蛋樹的資料。
A stack of documents.
一疊文件。
The topmost details the time and heating requirements for multiple Dragon-type species.
上面詳細地說明了各種龍蛋需要的孵化時間與溫度。
Oh, \PN! How nice of you to drop by.
哦，\PN！你來拜訪真是太好了。
I have some water just about to boil – how about something hot to drink?
我正要燒開一些水，來點熱飲怎麼樣？
…Well, I suppose I ought to do some work eventually.
…好吧，我想我得開始工作了。
Please, come back whenever you’d like. My door is always open, if you need a hot drink or to share your troubles.
如果你需要喝杯熱飲或分享煩惱，我的門永遠敞開著。
I can only promise results on problems that can be solved by early Makyan archaeology or a Garchomp… but that’s most problems.
我現在只能解決那些，早期馬凱亞古物相關，以及像凶牙鯊那樣暴力解決的問題...不過這好像已經包含大多數問題了。
Hah! I’ll see you, \PN.
哈哈！再見了，\PN。
Hello, \PN! It’s so good to see you again.
哦，\PN！很高興再見面。
I can’t talk for long, I’m afraid. I’m getting a paper ready to publish.
不過我不能陪你聊太久，我正準備發表一篇論文。
It’s my first non-archaeological work – I’m tackling the age-old question of “what’s a Dragon?”
這是我第一次寫非考古的文章，我正在解決“什麼才算龍”這個古老而又悠久的問題。
Is Charizard a Dragon? What about Milotic? Or certain Exeggutor subspecies?
比如噴火龍，美納斯，還有某種椰蛋樹，這都是龍嗎？
To put my findings succinctly, the only way to tell if something’s a Dragon is to hit it with an Outrage.
簡而言之，我的研究是，要確定某種事物是否是龍，那就直接用發逆鱗打過去。
That, um, tends to solve the debate rather quickly.
這樣...嗯...問題就解決了。
No
算了
Yes
孵化
Yes, please.
現在去
No, I'll go myself.
回頭去

A tattered page of customer reviews hangs from the wall.
牆上掛著一頁破舊的客戶評價。
One attributed to someone named "Oriel" is particularly enthusiastic.
其中有個叫“奧利爾”的人，其評價中難掩喜愛與熱情。
Oh. Hello. You’ve caught me at the absolute worst time, you know?
哦，你好，真是不巧，你碰上我最忙的時候了。
I’m technically breaking and entering at the moment.
現在我們都算是非法闖入了。
This used to be a cozy little restaurant run by a friend.
這裡以前是我一個朋友經營的小飯館。
She bought the place, remodeled it so she could cook on the first floor and live on the second, and now it’s this.
她花錢買下了這裡，並重新裝修，一樓做飯，二樓住人...但現在卻變成了這副模樣。
Empty.
空蕩蕩的。
Oh, it’s not so bad. Everything has its season, and in Makya it’s barely summer a day before winter comes.
哈，其實也沒那麼糟，萬物皆有時，而且在馬凱亞，夏天剛開始，冬天就要來了。
Constant tumult, this region.
這個地區總是處於動盪之中。
I didn’t believe it at first. That she’d just up and leave.
曾經我是這裡最受歡迎的常客，再加上我對鎖頭很在行。
I figured I was always welcome here anyways, and I know my way around a lock.
起初我並不相信她會突然離開。
Eternally, my savior.
放心，我不會忘的，我的恩人。
And if that flattery isn’t enough for you, I WAS trying to find another way to repay you.
如果只是恭維還不夠的話，或許可以用另一種方式來報答你。
Unfortunately, dinner seems to be off the table… no pun intended.
但很遺憾，今天在這裡的晚餐已經取消了...哈哈，開個玩笑。
Can you feel that, though? The stillness? I think we’re here for a reason.
我來這裡自然還有其他原因，你能感覺到嗎，這種寂靜？
Let’s look upstairs. You first, though – something’s off, and you’re the brave warrior.
我們上樓去看看吧，你先走...雖然有點不對勁，但我相信你是勇敢的戰士。
Not that I want you putting yourself in harm’s way on my behalf… but it would be rather gallant.
不是我想讓你為了我而冒險…但這樣做會顯得相當勇敢。
Oh? I’ll refrain from reading too much into that.
我不會對此做過度解讀的。
What I’m worried about is something a bit less fun.
我擔心的是...一些不太有趣的事情。
Let’s check upstairs, and be ready. You might end up having to save me again.
我們去樓上看看吧，做好準備，也許你...又得救我一次了。
Am I really that one-note?
我真的那麼單調嗎？
I’ll have to try and be more creative in the future – I can’t stand being cliché.
我受不了那些陳詞濫調...應該找個更有創意的方法。
To answer your question: I hope not, but there’s only one way to find out.
現在回答你的問題：我希望不是，但顯然這最合理。
Shall we look upstairs? At your leisure, of course.
我們去樓上看看吧，當然，你隨意。
Oh, no. I’m not going up there first. You’re the bold and brash one between us, aren’t you?
不，我不會先上去的。在我們兩個之間，你才是那個大膽而魯莽的人，對吧？
I'm sorry.
抱歉
Why are you here?
你為什麼在這？
You owe me.
你欠我一個人情
Huh?
哈？
So do I.
點頭
Avatar?
化身？
[Map255]
So it was an avatar after all. Two, in fact! How delightful!
果然是化身！而且有兩個！簡直是太美妙不過了！
Such grace, such magnificent power, such… oh, words fail me.
如此優雅又宏偉的力量...如此...哦，我不知道該怎麼形容了。
But it is a little convenient, isn’t it? The two of us come here.
不過這正合適不是嗎？是我們兩個來到的這裡。
I, the sensitive soul, the pilgrim, and you, the knight, the protector.
我，朝聖者，敏感的靈魂，還有你，騎士，守護之人。
And what should we find but a Gallade and a Gardevoir.
而且我們找到的正好是一個艾路雷朵和一個沙奈朵。
Maybe so, maybe not. In any case, I’m glad I had you walk upstairs first, and I hope you enjoyed the brawl.
或許吧，誰知道呢，不管怎樣，很感謝你的騎士精神，也希望你能享受這場戰鬥。
I honestly envy you. You get to see these avatars up close and truly interact with them. All I can do is view them from afar.
我真的很羨慕你，你可以近距離看到這些化身，並與它們真正互動，而我只能從遠處觀看。
So it would seem. Appearing in the same biome as their regular counterparts makes sense at first glance.
看起來應該是這樣的，即便有一定的生物群系影響。
But even that – how do they choose? Do they choose? Or are they pulled here by something?
可就算如此，它們又是怎麼選擇的？或者說它們做出主動選擇了嗎？還是被什麼強行安排在這裡的？
And if so, where were they before they were pulled here? If only I knew…
如果真是如此，那它們來到這裡之前呢？又會在哪兒？如果知道就好了...
Perhaps I did. Not intentionally, but, well, maybe that’s how I view us. Relationship goals or something.
或許我只是無意中知道了，但...嗯...或許這只是我們的視角，強行將關係綁定上去而已。
And somehow that called them, or created them. If so, I’m deeply sorry – I didn’t intend for you to brawl on my behalf today.
至於說將它們召喚過來，或者說創造出來的方法，我很抱歉...我今天其實...真的沒有讓你為我而戰的打算。
And thank you. If you hadn’t showed up, that Gallade might’ve decided I had one too many limbs.
不過還是要謝謝你，如果沒有你，那隻艾路雷朵或許會把我大卸八塊的。
Oh, I can make up for this.
當然，我也有給你的補償。
Well, what do I know – you probably think an opportunity to fight these things is a gift in itself.
好吧，或許這些不夠...但你也可以將與它們戰鬥的機會本身視作一份禮物。
But in case that doesn’t count as me repaying you, have this back.
如果還不夠的話我也沒辦法了，畢竟朝聖者身上的東西並不多。
It’s told me what I wanted to know – findings I’ll share with you sometime.
它告知了我想知道的東西 - 我也會在某個時刻與你分享我的發現。
I also happened upon this by pure luck while exploring the deep marshes.
這是我在沼澤裡找到的。
It isn’t much, but I want you to have it.
雖然不是很值錢，但我想將這個贈予你。
I know this wasn’t exactly what I promised, but I enjoyed it anyways.
我知道這不是一次完美的體驗，但我還是很享受這次經歷。
I hope you did too, and I’ll see you around. I’ll make it back to you. I promise. Until we meet again.
希望你也一樣，我們還會再見的，保重。
Coincidence.
巧合
It isn't random?
不是隨機的？
Did you call them?
你叫來的？
[Map256]
[Map257]
You... you're that Mavis kid, aren't you.
你...你就是那個叫梅維斯的孩子吧。
Pfft, some wannabe aristocrat you are. Old money? You don't even know the half of it.
呸，就你還想著當貴族，你連貴族的門檻都摸不到！
I offer you a deal, the location of my personal private island. Not my family's mind you, mine.
我跟你做筆交易怎麼樣？這是我私人島嶼的位置，不是我家人的，是我的。
I've never been to it, don't even know what's there. My great-grandmother's estate left it to me.
雖然我還沒去過，甚至不知道那裡有什麼。我曾祖母去世後就是我的了。
If you'd like to go to it, simply beat me. It's not like I care what happens to it.
如果你想去看看，那就打敗我吧，我不在乎那裡變成什麼樣子。
THE SPIRITS HERE SCREAM!
這裡的靈魂在尖叫！
PLEASE! IT IS TOO BRIGHT!
求求你！太亮了！
HELP ME, LAINIE! HELP ME!
救命，蘭妮！救救我！
They can be bested, they can be bested, they can...
它們可以被打敗，它們可以被打敗，它們可以…
Bestie, it's time to invest in our stocks while they're low. We're accepting bestie buyouts!
姐妹，你看今天的股市了嗎，是時候投資股市了！
Time to cash in on the best bonds... get my bestie estate in order...
該把那些債券變現了...該整理好我姐妹的遺產了...
Maybe it's time to invest in you stocks instead...
或許在你身上下注也不錯...
Bestie, are you cheating? No...
姐妹，你是不是出軌了？
Good work bestie, we'll be rolling in bestie bucks if we invest in your bestie business right now.
幹得漂亮，姐妹，如果我們現在投資姐妹股，那我們的姐妹資產就會滾滾而來。
Hey!
嘿
Hey hey hey hey!
嘿嘿嘿嘿！
OK, so, like, I know what you’re thinking: "Wow, Candy, you’re, like,
嘿嘿，大概...我知道你在想什麼，比如“糖兒，你...大概...
super-cool for hanging out in such a super-cool place full of dangerous trainers." And, uh, yeah, thank you for noticing, I totally am.
在這樣一個全是資深訓練家的地方閒逛真是太酷了。”之類的想法，另外謝謝你注意到了，我的確很酷。
But I’ve got a reason, and it’s not even illegal!
但我有來這裡的理由，而且這次不是非法的事情！
So, apparently Tamarind shows up in Whitebloom Town every few months to like check in or whatever, and I just did a li'l recon and...
塔瑪琳每隔幾個月都會來白花鎮，進行檢查或者做些其他什麼...所以我稍微偵查了一下，然後...
OK, maybe it was actually a little illegal.
呃，好像還是有點違法。
No, shh, I can feel you, like, being judgy right now, and I totally don’t need that energy in my life right now.
別，噓，我能感覺到，你...大概...在評判我，我現在完全不需要那種能量。
Because she’s the second-in-command of all Team Chasm! Like, duh!
因為她是裂隙隊的二把手！大概...就這樣！
She’s probably at the top of my hit list – I kinda forgot where I put it and now I can’t find it anymore but it’s almost 100 percent got her name in
她在我的名單上可是待了好久了...雖然我有點記不清名單在哪兒了，但我百分百確定她的名字在上面。
big letters at the top!
而且還是很大的篇幅！
Ugh, I can’t believe how on the same wavelength we are. You are like my buddy cop soulmate.
呃...我完全沒想到，我們的思維方式如此一致，你就像是我的靈魂伴侶一般。
Oh, uh, yeah, sorry, hi, love you too. Cool?
哦...呃...對...那個...我也愛你，好嗎？
Cool. Let’s talk about the interesting stuff!
我們還是來聊些有趣的事吧！
So, I broke into the abandoned lab and rooted around in there – which, it’s like mega-abandoned and super unsafe but, um, who cares – and found these.
我闖進了這裡的廢棄實驗室，在那裡找線索...的確那裡已經...很不安全了，但是...嗯...我不在乎...然後就找到了這些。
Um, which is the part where I’d show you the stuff I’d found but I kinda shoved it in my backpack and that place is a total mess.
呃...的確我應該向你展示一下，但我把它塞進揹包裡了，那個地方又很亂。
So, uh, instead of digging it out, just take my word on it!
所以，嗯...我就不拿出來了，你只要相信我就好！
It’s this like dossier on a whole bunch of old Team Chasm operations that Tamarind must’ve left in there and forgot about!
那時以前裂隙隊的一份行動檔案，塔瑪琳一定是把它忘在那裡了。
Oh, all kinds of stuff with these, like, killer names.
嗯，上面有各種各樣的，大概...像是殺手一樣的名字。
Like “Operation Vagabond Plumage” or “Operation Cardinal Sin” or “Project Theodicy.” It gives me happy chills just thinking about it!
什麼“流浪羽毛行動”、“紅衣主教行動”或“神論項目”。想想這些就讓我興奮地發抖。
Yeah, but she’s like totally on that grindset 24/7 with running ex-Chasm stuff plus Professor work plus bureaucracy.
是啊，不過她應該是全年無休地忙著運營裂隙隊的事情，還要做博士的工作，還要上下打通關係。
I knew she had to slip up eventually! Can’t just chug coffee forever!
就算是一直喝咖啡，她也遲早會失誤的！
What? No! No way!
什麼？不！不可能
OK, wait, like, maybe that’s a good idea?
誒，等下，大概...也許這是個好主意？
Like, if I’ve already got everything I need to know, I can totally get her to lower her guard by giving it back.
大概...既然我已經知道了我想知道的這些內容，那我完全可以這樣來放鬆她的警惕。
Anyways, the main thing I actually, like,
總之，我實際上...大概...
care about is \nthis after-action report for something called “Project Testament.” Y’know how Velenz is, like, this total ghost town?
關心的是\n這份關於“Project Testament”的行動後報告。你知道維倫茲現在完全是個鬼城嗎？
Well if I’m reading this right – and I had to look up a few words but I think I am – Team Chasm caused that!
如果我猜的沒錯的話...根據我得到的線索，沒錯...就是裂隙隊導致的這一切！
They found some way to make avatars show up and secretly made them swarm the town, ‘cause apparently Velenz was super-resistant to helping.
他們一定是找到了某種方法，讓化身出現並祕密地湧向城市，就因為夜幽市對他們的抵制。
Then they, like, intentionally lured avatars into the caves around there to mess up the foundations, and the whole thing started to sink into the mud!
然後他們故意誘導化身進入周圍的洞穴裡面，破壞一切，讓建築陷入泥潭中。
Seriously, it’s screwed-up!
這真是，太邪惡了！
Yeah! Like, this is the stuff Team Chasm did, and people are still, like, totally OK with them running around!
沒錯，大概...就是那個裂隙隊乾的，可人們卻任憑他們四處亂跑。
Um... not completely sure, but I’m absolutely certain they did some evil stuff there, OK?
嗯...不是完全確定，但我他們肯定在那裡做了很多邪惡的事情對吧？
I don’t know how they did it, or if the whole, uh, what was it called... “soil liquefication?”
我不知道他們是怎麼做到的，那個...呃...叫什麼來著...“土壤液化”？
Yeah, I dunno if that was intentional or not, but the report is pretty damn happy about it!
沒錯，我不知道他們究竟怎麼想的，但他們顯然對成果很滿意！
I mean, like, kinda? The report doesn’t really get into the hows or whys that much, but, like, c’mon!
我覺得，大概...有點？報告上沒有詳細說明願意之類的，但是...大概...總之！
If you don’t like these people, just, like, fight them? This is messed up.
因為不喜歡某些人就去攻擊他們，這簡直不可理喻。
No!
不！
No, no, no. No talking.
不，不，不，不要這樣！
I know you’re friends with Tamarind, and, like, yeah, she did you a favor, and she’s cool. But this lady has done some evil stuff.
我知道你和塔瑪琳是朋友，並且...大概...對，她幫過你，我也覺得她很酷，但她也的確做了很多邪惡的事情。
I’ve got a plan to confront her, and I want your help, alright?
我有一個解決這些問題的計劃，而且需要你的幫助，所以？
Once the tournament is about to start, pretty much everybody is gonna be there, so there’s gonna be way less goons just out and about.
只要等到競技大會開始，會有很多人聚在那邊，外面就不會有多少走狗了。
I’ll send her an anonymous li’l letter – ooh, I can cut up the dossiers for letters and glue them together! That’s awesome!
然後我給她寄一封匿名信...對，我可以把檔案的內容剪下來貼上去，這個想法真帶感！
Anyways, yeah, send her a letter, tell her to come to the <imp>sewer maintenance building on the river banks</imp>. She’ll be there.
總之，我會給她寫信，讓她她到河邊的<imp>下水道維護站</imp>去。她肯定會過去的。
Then you and me – we get some justice.
然後我們...就可以伸張正義了。
Alright? Alright! Great, cool, not gonna let you respond to that because honestly you can’t change my mind!
可以嗎？可以的！沒錯，就這樣！我不會給你拒絕的機會，而且你也改變不了我的想法！
You’re my friend and partner in crime and definitely not the minion of an evil mastermind! Toodles!
你是我的朋友，是正義的犯罪夥伴，絕對不是邪惡博士的手下，拜拜！
Hmph, a petty child comes to swing at their superiors. What arrogance.
哼，一個小屁孩居然敢跟自己的長輩交手，真是傲慢無禮。
This... proves nothing. A mere Pokemon battle cannot and will not close the continents of distance between our lines.
這...證明不了什麼。一場精靈對決而已，這不會縮小我們之間的差距！
Well, if there is one thing the Mavis line is good for, it's savagery. Go on, get your little prize, I'm sure it costs more than mom makes in a decade.
果然，梅維斯最擅長的就是野蠻，快去拿你的小獎品吧，它抵得上你媽媽十年賺的錢。
What are you trying to talk to me for? Hoping that a shred of my nobility might rub off on you?
你別來跟我說話！想指望我的貴族氣質能影響到你？
Look at yourself and tell me you'll be anything close to me. You'd be delusional to think so.
你自己照照鏡子看看，你的氣質能與我相提並論？簡直痴心妄想。
A page labeled "Guardian Secret Location".
這張紙上寫著靖守島的位置。
It contains a set of GPS coordinates.

Bestie stocks are crashing now that they're a confirmed cheater...
姐妹出軌，股票大跌...
I wonder if we're eligable for a bestie rebate, bestie.
不知道我們能不能拿到姐妹回扣，姐妹。
You're our bestie now, of course. Battle besties.
你現在也是我們的姐妹了，對戰姐妹。
Legends say there was a Trainer here that lost their arm by feeding it to starving Larvitar.
傳說曾有一位訓練家，在這裡把自己的手臂餵給了捱餓的幼基拉祈。
But legends are legends. For now, I am content with my own story.
但傳說就只是傳說，現在，我會對自己而感到滿意。
Be careful down here.
在這裡要小心。
The cave-in that happened around these parts was a tragedy.
附近發生的坍塌事件，是一個不折不扣的悲劇。
Perhaps a harsh reminder that adventures are not always sunshine and rainbows.

I gotta talk to Tamarind.

或許你會喜歡這個紀念品，紀念你曾經來過這裡。
Pokemon Lab
精靈實驗室
…Are you bored yet?
…你無聊嗎？
Of battling, I mean.
我是說戰鬥。
Only so many Pokémon, so many types, so many moves. Opponents become predictable. Easily manipulated.
精靈的種類就這麼多，屬性就這麼幾種，技能不過就一千多個。當了解這些後，對手就很容易戰勝了。
I’m so… bored.
我…太無聊了。
You know how much I tried to fight it?
你知道我為了抵抗這種感覺付出了多少努力嗎？
I set aside my entire team, trained a new one, and I was still bored. No one could even slow me down.
我一次次丟下之前的隊伍，組建新的精靈隊伍，但還是一樣無聊，沒有人能給我帶來興奮感。
So then I only used Bug-types. Only Fire-types. Only unevolved Pokémon. It just got worse.
然後我試著只使用蟲系或火系，只使用未進化的精靈...結果只是越來越糟。
Everyone’s so predictable. They don’t understand Pokémon the way I do, fight the way I do.
每個人的心思都很好猜，他們不像我理解精靈，也沒辦法像我一樣戰鬥。
I wandered all of Makya, catching only one Pokémon from each place I visited. Any time they failed me, I released them into the wild.
然後我試著漫遊整個馬凱亞，在每個地方只捕捉一隻，並在它們讓我失望時將其放生。
Even that grew old after a few months. The only person that’s broken up that boredom is… you.
幾個月後...這也乏味了。唯一打破這種無聊的...是你。
So, \PN, I ask you: are you bored yet?
那麼，\PN，我問你：你也已經厭倦了嗎？
…Hmph.
…哼。
You will be. Eventually.
你會的。最終。
…So you are like me.
…所以你和我一樣。
I’m sorry. I truly am.
對不起，我真的很抱歉。
You don’t have to tell me. It won’t change my mind.
你不必回答我，這不會改變我的想法。
Because we can change things.
因為我們可以改變一切。
I can, at least. I will.
至少我可以，而且我會這樣做。
…This probably isn’t what you were expecting me to say.
…這可能不是你期望我說的話。
Did you want me to quiver and quaver like a child? Stumble over my words and beg for forgiveness?
你想讓我像孩子一樣顫抖和哭泣嗎？希望我結巴著，乞求原諒？
Sorry. This is me.
對不起。這就是我。
This is the real me – the one I show to my Pokémon. The only ones I can truly talk to. And you.
這就是真正的我...向我的精靈所展示的我，你...是唯一真正可以交流的人。
All of this is going to be clean white stone in a little while. I wanted to come back just to see it one last time.
一切很快...就會變成潔白的石頭，我想回來看看它最後一眼。
Couldn’t stand the idea of talking to anyone. Not Mom, not anyone. It won’t matter soon.
不用再強忍著跟任何人交談，媽媽也是，其他人也是...很快就...都不重要了。
Remaking the world.
重塑世界。
The era of human dominance is at an end. With Regigigas’s power, I’ll reset everything back to the beginning.
人類主宰世界的時代要結束了，我會憑藉雷吉奇卡斯的力量，把一切推到起點。
When the world was new… full of potential…
推到世界...還是嶄新的時候...充滿了潛力...
I want a world free from this constant boredom.
我想要一個不再無聊的世界。
I want a world in which the ancient power of Pokémon is set free.
我想要一個解放了精靈古老力量的世界。
I want a brand new blank slate.
我想要一個全新的...純白的世界。
Yes. I am.
嗯，我知道。
Incapable of relating to humans, or even speaking to them.
無法與人類建立聯繫，甚至無法與他們交談。
My heart races when they look at me. I am insane, or at least ill. But that doesn’t mean I’m wrong.
他們看著我時，我會心跳加速。我可能瘋了，或者有病。但這並不代表我是錯的。
I’d expect nothing less. You’re just like me when I was young.
我不奢望你能理解，你跟我年輕時一樣。
Wanting to be good. So they’d love me…
想要變得善良，這樣他們就會愛我…
…You understand, don’t you?
…你明白，對吧？
Team Chasm uncovered the Regis.
裂隙隊發現了雷吉。
Tamarind understood them because she was a scientist. I understood them because they were Pokémon.

Each one a testament to an era, a chapter in humankind’s domination of the world.
每一個都是時代的見證，是人類主宰世界的一個篇章。
And then Regigigas, a remnant of the first era, the primordial era, just after Arceus created the universe.
然後是雷吉奇卡斯，誕生於第一個時代，就在阿爾宙斯創造宇宙之後。
Arceus created, and Regigigas shaped.
由阿爾宙斯創造...由雷吉奇卡斯塑造...
Pokémon were greater, before they became domesticated.
在精靈被馴化之前，它們曾經更偉大。
You’ve seen the echoes of those primordial Pokémon. Soon, that’s what all Pokémon will become.
你已經看到了那些原始精靈的迴響，很快，所有精靈都會變成那樣。
No, not hostile.
不，它們不是敵對。
You’re so used to Pokémon being loving and subservient that it’s shocking to see them demand respect.
你太習慣精靈的順從了，甚至因為它們對尊重的要求而感到驚訝。
They’re wild animals. Leave them alone.
它們本就是野生動物，不應該去打擾它們。
What about Rattata? What about Boltund? What about Venipede?
那麼小拉達呢？那麼電束木呢？那麼百足蜈蚣呢？
Just another species. Not privileged. Not the center of the universe. Not anymore.
只是其中一種物種，不再是宇宙的中心，不再擁有特權，
Returned to nothing but white stone.
最終只剩下白色的石頭。
Who knows what humans will do from there? I’m sure they’ll find a way. They’re persistent.
誰知道人類會做什麼呢？他們總會有自己的辦法，一直都那麼執著。
I’m good with Pokémon. Very good.
我會跟精靈們相處得很好。
I’ll be better off there than here, that’s for sure.
我會生活得比現在更好，一定。
But I’m wasting your time. I’m only good at one thing, in the end.
不過，我只是在拖延你的時間，最後...我只擅長一件事。
You ready?
你準備好了嗎？
…Alright.
…好的。
Care to enjoy the view with me? It’s beautiful.
那就一起欣賞一下美景吧？真漂亮啊。
Good. I know you won’t bore me.
我知道你不會讓我感到無聊。
Maybe now you’ll understand – this is the only language that we both speak, in the end.
也許現在你會明白...這是我們最終共同使用的唯一語言。
If we’re friends, you’ll fight me.
如果我們是朋友，你會和我戰鬥。
If we’re enemies, you’ll fight me.
如果我們是敵人，你會和我戰鬥。
Rivals, you’ll fight me.
如果我們是對手，你會和我戰鬥。
So why, then?
那麼，為什麼呢？
…Don’t say that.
別…別這麼說。
I – I… I care about you too.
我...我...我也關心你。
I’m sorry. I’m sorry – just… just fight me.
對不起。對不起...只是...只是和我戰鬥。
Show me. It’s the only thing I know.
展示給我看。那是我唯一能懂的事情。
…Then watch as the world you know is erased.
…那就看著你所知道的世界被抹去吧。
It’s that simple.
就是這麼簡單。
Answer? No, of course not. You won’t stop me here.
答案？當然不是。你阻止不了我。
But it’s how we understand each other better. Show me who you are, \PN.
但這是我們能更好地理解彼此的方式，展示給我看你是誰，\PN。
Oh? You – you really think so? You’ve done so before.
哦？你...你真的這麼認為嗎？你以前也這樣做過。
I’m sure you can. Just try. You’ve never let me down before.
我覺得你能做到。試試看，你以前從未讓我失望過。
So, shall we dance?
那麼，我們開始吧？
Regieleki, Regidrago, you can go now. Return to your tombs.
雷吉艾勒奇，雷吉鐸拉戈，你們可以回到墓穴中了。
You’ll be unmade, too, once this is all done. Just like the eras you commemorate.
一旦這一切結束，你們也將被消滅，就像你們紀念的時代一樣。
Do you understand now?
現在你明白了嗎？
The real reason? Haven’t I given you enough?
真正的原因？我說的還不夠嗎？
A world of untapped potential! An end to the boredom! Freeing Pokémon from their saccharine subservience!
一個未被開發的有潛力的世界！不再無聊！解放精靈！讓它們不再被奴役！
Fine. You want the real reason?
好吧...你想知道真正的原因嗎？
…Not lying. I just haven’t told you everything.
…不是在撒謊。我只是沒有告訴你全部。
To free their potential, to free them from humans, and to free… me.
解放它們的潛力，解放它們脫離人類的束縛，解放…我自己。
…Always. Terrified. Not of any Pokémon, never in my life. But always of people.
…總是...害怕。不是害怕任何精靈，我這輩子從來沒有過。但總是害怕人類。
That’s why I have to do this.
這就是為什麼我必須這麼做。
You don’t understand, \PN. If I was good with people like you, I wouldn’t be doing this. But I’m not.
你不明白，\PN。如果我像你一樣擅長與人相處，我就不會這麼做了，但我不行。
And you know what drives me mad? They should understand that! They should respect it! I saved this entire damn region! I’m a hero!
你知道什麼讓我發瘋嗎？他們應該明白！他們應該尊重！是我拯救了這個該死的地區！我是英雄！
And how am I repaid? With prying eyes and paparazzi.
而我得到的回報是窺探的目光和狗仔隊的追逐。
I thought if I was good enough, they’d be kind to me. They’d understand me.
我曾以為如果我足夠優秀，他們會對我友善，他們會理解我。
Well, I became Champion, and they still made me sick. The thought of having to talk to anyone still terrified me.
可我成為了冠軍，他們還是讓我感到噁心，我不想跟任何人交流，我害怕跟他們交流。
So I disappeared, and then the ennui came.
所以我就消失了，然後無聊降臨了。
Enough. Enough! I deserve to be happy! I deserve to be at peace!
我受夠了！夠了！我應該得到快樂！我應該得到平靜！
If I can’t talk to people, then I’ll create a world where people don’t rule. Where they don’t matter.
如果我不能和人交流，那我就會創造一個人類無法統治的世界。他們不重要！
Pokémon will rule, and I will understand them, and they will understand me.
精靈將會統治一切，我能理解它們，它們也能理解我。
I’ll be the shadow behind the throne, and I’ll – I’ll finally be happy!
我將成為王位背後的影子，我會...我會得到快樂！
I’m so tired, \PN. I’m so very tired.
我很累，\PN。我真的很累。
You can never understand it – living in a world ruled by people you’re terrified of. People you can’t comprehend.
你永遠無法理解...生活在一個由你害怕的人統治的世界裡...周圍都是無法理解的人。
I deserve some rest. I deserve some peace. And this is the only way I’m going to get it.
我應該得到休息，我應該得到平靜，這是我唯一能得到的方式。
That’s the real reason. For me. So I can have a world where I belong.
這就是真正的原因，為了我，所以我可以擁有一個屬於我的世界。
Do you? Could you ever?
你能嗎？
I deserve a chance at happiness. I never got one.
我應該有得到幸福的機會，我從未得到過。
Everyone else did. It’s only fair.
其他人都得到了，不公平。
Oh.
哦。
Oh… well, thank you. If only it changed anything.
哦...好吧，謝謝。但這並沒有改變什麼。
I do.
我必須。
Or I can remain in this world forever a stranger, wandering without a purpose.
不然我留在這個世界裡，作為一個陌生人，漫無目的地徘徊嗎？
Would you condemn me to that?
你會譴責我嗎？
The Championship is getting close, you know.
競技大會就要開始了。
I’ll wait for you. Once the Championship ends, I’ll make my preparations.
我會等你。結束後，我會做好準備。
You’ll find me in Regigigas’s chamber. If you decide you want to stop me or join me, meet me there.
你會在雷吉奇卡斯那裡找到我。不管你阻止我或加入我，在那裡見。
And then we’ll settle things the only way we know how. It’s only right to give you one last fight.
然後我們用我們唯一知道的方式解決問題，給你最後一次戰鬥。
Goodbye, \PN.
再見，\PN。

Well, I say back in town, but really she's at her habitual moping spot south of the old tower.
當然，我說的是進入鎮子，畢竟她經常在南邊那個角落裡悶悶不樂地想著什麼。
I guess nothing's really changed.

To be quite honest, I have no idea how I have gotten here. But, as an artist, I am still beholden to the craft.
我也不知道自己是怎麼走到這裡的，作為一名藝術家，我只是在跟著自己的靈感前進。
I certainly am painted out...
我當然是出來畫畫的...
I fear what might happen if I stay here any longer. But fear will not beat me.
我擔心在這裡會遇到些麻煩，但恐懼不能阻擋我對藝術的熱愛。
I might get a better view of those crystals if I get closer, but I'm afraid of being caught by the avatars here...
只要再走進一點，或許就能看清楚那些水晶，但我怕被這裡的化身發現...

The shipment of fruit from Frostflow got done without a hitch.

Or so I thought. This here Bounsweet tagged along, the rascal, and now I don't know what to do with it.
至少我是這麼以為的。這隻甜竹竹偷偷跟來了，這小淘氣，現在我不知道該怎麼處理它。
It may be cute, but I'm raising enough Pokemon back at the farm as is.
它可能很可愛，但我在農場已經養了足夠多的精靈了。
That's why I'll offer 'em to you for $5000.
所以我打算以5000美元的價格把它賣給你。

Huh? Oh! You must be the Trainer that Scilla was talking about.
你一定是希拉說的那個訓練家吧。
She was talking non-stop about your battle with her. Had to see what you're made of myself.
她最近一直在說你們那場對戰，我也想親自見識一下你的實力。
Scilla might have already introduced me.
對了，你應該知道我是誰了吧？
If not, I'm Chara. Makya's fourth regional Champion.
我是夏菈，馬凱亞第四位冠軍。
Ready for a battle?
準備好了嗎？
Well you better be back. Can't let Scilla represent the Diakos family alone.
你最好快一點，希拉自己可不能代表黛科思家族。
Don't let me down, I cut my fishing vacation short for this.
不要讓我失望哦，我可是特地提前結束假期回來的。
You're just as Scilla said. A certified skilled Trainer.
果然就像希拉說的那樣強，你的確是非常優秀的訓練家。
You might be able to take a shot at a little problem of mine.
或許你能幫我解決一個小問題。
If you're interested, meet me at the Lighthouse. I've got something to show you.
如果你願意的話，就到燈塔來，我有東西要給你看。

An ancient grandfather clock.
一座古老的落地鍾。
It's in pristine condition, probably due to careful maintenance.
它保存得非常完好，想必它的主人很愛惜它。
Most Pokeballs are crafted in factories nowadays.
現在大多數精靈球都是在工廠裡做出來的。
It's hard to find a specialty ball. For good reason, mind you. There isn't much of a use for some of these compared to Ultra or Great Balls.
這裡很難找到某種特殊的球，畢竟大部分花裡胡哨的球，用處並沒有常規球大。
With that being said, it's nice to craft the aesthetic you wish for. Even if it's a bit hard to do so.
雖然這麼說，但能有個獨特的外觀，也是蠻不錯的...雖然很難。
Oh, goodness...
我的天吶...
You've got a truly amazing apricorn in your posession.
你這個果子也太特別了！
It's been my life's dream to work with such a fine specimen.
如果能用它來...那簡直是我畢生的夢想！
Where did you find it?
你在哪兒找到它的？
Nevermind that. I'll respect your privacy.
沒關係，我會尊重你的隱私。
But still, I implore you, let me craft a Poke Ball from that beautiful fruit.
不過我還是會懇求你，讓我用這個漂亮的果子做一個精靈球吧。
Mmmm... exercise some self-restraint, now.
嗯...好吧，我自我剋制一下。
Well, if you feel differently later on, I'll be right here.
如果你改主意了，可以隨時來這裡找我。
I've been praying for you to change your mind about that Gilded Apricorn.
我一直在祈禱，你能改變對鍍金球果的想法。
*sigh*
*粗氣*
Wish I didn't get my hopes up.
如果沒抱這種希望就好了。
I'm giddy with excitement!
我激動地暈頭轉向了！
To work I go...
我這就開始...
Crafting Poke Balls from Apricorns is an old art, but not an exact science.
用樹果來製作精靈球，是一種古老的藝術，但並不算一門精確的學科。
But I can already tell that this ball has wonderous properties.
但我還是能看得出，這個球一定有神器的功效。
Please, go out and use it on something special.
請把它用在某些特別的地方吧。
That Radiant Ball is my crowning achievement.

Is this your first time up here? I can give you a quick rundown about the place if you want.
你第一次來？我可以給你簡短地介紹一下。
Ah, great, then I'll spare myself the time.
啊，太好了，那我就不浪費時間了。
Alright, so when Sweetrock switched over to conveyor belts, a ton of teleporting Clefable suddenly had no role to fill.
自從蜜巖港改用傳送帶後，對皮可西的需求就降低了。
So I brought 'em here and started training them on long range travel.
因此我把它們帶到這裡，訓練它們進行長距離傳送。
Some others had the same idea, but we like to keep everything here on a need-to-know business.
雖然也有其他有同樣的想法的人，但我們更希望能將技術掌握在手中。
It might be my lighthouse, but I'm sure as hell not gonna start a fight with who-knows-what for what amounts to mostly vacant space.
這可能是我的燈塔，但我絕對不會為了一個幾乎空蕩蕩的地方和天知道什麼東西打架。
If you know what's good for you, you'll keep your head down and not talk to anyone.
所以希望你能對在這裡看到的一些關鍵性的內容保密。
Anyways, I've got an issue for you to take care of. I'd do it myself, but, well, I suppose it's a bit beyond me.
說回整體，我有個任務要給你，我本以為能自己處理，但顯然有些困難。
It's on an island far off the coast of Makya, so I'll have to have the Clefable send you over.
我們需要去馬凱亞海外的一個島上，所以我得讓皮可西送你過去。
I can, uh, also send you the GPS coordinates. Got to meet the maid that drives your boat. Cool girl.
我可以把GPS座標發給你，另外見見你那個很酷的開船女僕。
Anyways yeah. Talk to me again if you're ready to go.
等你準備好了再聯繫我。
So, uh, ready to head out?
所以，你準備好了？
I'd recommend taking your A-team as well. There's gonna be a bit more to worry about on your trip outside of turbulence.
我建議你帶上自己最強的精靈，這次的旅程中會有很多挑戰。
I've been here.
我來過
I haven't been here.
第一次來

Great, another Trainer, just what I needed.
太好了，又來一個，我剛好需要你這樣的人。
You feeling up to fight avatars? Because I got a whole bunch of them right under me.
做好跟化身戰鬥的準備了嗎？我這下面有一堆。
Dunno what put 'em there, but I need someone to go in and clean 'em out.
我也不知道他們是怎麼出現的，但必須得有人去處理一下。
I've cleared at least a dozen of 'em by now, but the avatar of Diancie had to come and ruin my streak.
我已經清理了十幾個了，但是蒂安希的化身斷了我的連勝。
Gotta say, the news was right. Avatars are tough. Not even a former champ can reliably take 'em.
不得不說，新聞說的對，化身沒那麼好對付，即使是前冠軍處理起來也有風險。
If you manage to get rid of it, we can talk after. You can keep whatever item it drops.
只要你擊敗它，就可以來找我拿點酬勞了。
Any luck down there?
進展如何？
No? Keep at it I guess.
毫無進展嗎？看來得繼續努力了。
So you managed to beat the Diancie avatar? Nice!
所以你打敗了蒂安希的化身了？太好了！
Couldn't manage to do that myself. Most of my 'mons didn't have a great matchup against it.
靠我一人對付起來實在困難，我的大部分精靈都被它剋制。
Say, my Pokemon are pretty rested now. I bet they'd be keen on having a battle with the team that took out the Diancie avatar.
說起來，我的精靈已經休息好了，我想它們很樂意與能打敗蒂安希化身的你戰鬥。
How 'bout it yeah? Come back when you get rested yourself. Not every day a former champion wants to battle you.
怎麼樣？你休息好了就來一場吧，前冠軍可不是每天都能遇到的。
You ready for a match?
你準備好戰鬥了嗎？
Yeah, sounds good. Whenever is fine.
沒問題，隨時都可以。
Hah, you've got me pumped for this.
哈哈，你讓我興奮起來了。
Well, well, ain't that something?
沒錯，沒錯，這種感覺真好！
You're pretty damn good, I'll give you that. Beating me and that Diancie is impressive.
我必須承認，你真的很厲害，無論是打敗我還是那隻蒂安希，都是非常了不起的成就。
Might have to call the others warning them that someone might be trying to be the undisputed best.
看來我得警告下某些人，現在有個正試圖成為最強訓練家的新人出現了。
If you haven't done so already, you can find your next fight in Prizca, at the Ironclad Dojo. Trainer by the name of Scilla, can't miss her.
如果你已經準備好了，可以去宏禮市挑戰鋼鐵武館，它們的館主希拉也是前冠軍。
Other than that, I know Chara's set up in Sweetrock, near the factory.
至於另一位前冠軍夏菈，她通常在蜜巖港的工廠附近。
Well, best of luck on that. I'm probably gonna spend the next week contacting anyone that can get my basement fixed.
好的，祝你好運。接下來我的花一週時間，找人來修一下我家的地下室了。
Ya know, the former champions have got a group chat thing going on.
你聽說過嗎，前冠軍們有一個群。
It's not really active, but it makes me feel like part of something, ya know?
雖然不是很活躍，但也算是一種象徵了，懂吧？
Not now.

My brother and I used to be the lightkeepers for the harbor.
我和我哥哥曾經\都是港口的燈塔管理員。

但我現在年紀大了，只能讓夏菈繼承這份工作。
Her sister is busy with the dojo in Prizca...
而她姐姐...則在宏禮市忙著管理武館...
Between managing the lighthouse and being a top Trainer, it's a miracle she's been able to keep at it for so long.
一邊要管理燈塔，一邊要抽出時間訓練精靈，她能夠堅持這麼久真是個奇蹟。

She's a master of Fairy- and Steel-type Pokemon. A good combination, but there are a few chinks in the armor.
她使用的是鋼和妖精兩種屬性，這兩種精靈組合起來很強，但是也有一些弱點。
Psychic-types will get you far against her Steel types, and Bug-types prey on her Fairy-types uncontested.
超能系很適合用來對付鋼系，蟲系則可以輕鬆應對妖精系。

Have you ever been teleported by a Pokemon before?

Clafable, away!
皮可西，我們走！
I vomit every time I teleport, but it gets me out of a lot of awkward conversations. Important for business.

他們未曾預料到暴雨將至，而你卻在風暴中屹立。
As you might have inferred, this was a lesson.

That being true, there is a request we would like to make.

This cannot be a surprise to you, can it, dear?
這對你來說不是值得驚訝的吧，小可愛？
Phenomenal work, darling.
幹得漂亮，小可愛。
Our analyses are harsh and regularly find challengers wanting.
我們的評估標準很嚴格，經常能發現挑戰者不足之處。
Your team exceeded on all axes. Take our badge.

When you train your Pokémon, think of us.

The company allows me to analyze challengers to improve my team, and provides candy and equipment to do so.
公司允許我分析挑戰者以完善我的團隊，併為我提供糖果和設備。
I provide my charismatic skills and bring challengers to the gym.
而我則以自身為餌將挑戰者吸引到這裡。
My purpose above all else in this is to test challengers to find a suitable candidate.
我做這些的測試的目的，是從中找到一個合適的候選人。
Specifically, for eliminating a remnant of Team Chasm’s tampering with Regigigas.
具體來說，是為了消除被裂隙隊影響的雷吉奇卡斯的殘像。
That candidate is you, dear. Said remnant is a beast of dire strength.

Find it south of the docks, down the ladder hidden on one the crescent-shaped islands.
它就在碼頭以南的新月島上，你可以在梯子下面找到它。

It is done?

哈哈哈！哈哈哈哈！
My long charade is at an end!
終於，我再也不用偽裝了！
Change is on the wind for me, darling.
對我來說，變革已經開始了，小可愛。
I’d tell you what I’ll do, or where I’m going… but you know I’d be lying.
我可以告訴你我想做什麼，或者我要去哪裡...但...我不保證一定是真話哦。
These appear to be Victoire’s notes. Most of it is an extensive to-do list.
看起來是薇克特爾的筆記，其中大部分是待辦事項清單。
“Perfume of that smell that’s only found inside of a tank.”
“只有坦克裡才有的香水味。”
“Make fusing Pokémon a real thing.”
“讓精靈融合成為現實。”
“Mecha-Fidough.”

A spreedsheet program is open with dozens of tabs, and a dizzing amount of numbers.

Yezera and the others are gone, I’m afraid. It’s just you… and… me.
葉澤拉和其他人都走了，恐怕只剩下你…和我了。
We won. No reason for me to be here. Absolutely none.
我們贏了，我也沒有理由繼續留在這裡了，這回是真的沒什麼理由了。
Other than the immense enjoyment I’m about to extract from dismantling your team.
除了我即將從毀滅你和你的精靈中獲得的巨大樂趣。
A friend of Yezera’s. Besides that, I’m masked for a reason.
我是葉澤拉的朋友，至於我為什麼不戴面具...
I would ask who you are, but quite frankly it doesn’t matter. I’m going to find out soon enough.
你是誰，坦白說我不關心，而且我很快就能知道。
There’s only so many types of people in the world.
世界上只有那麼幾類人。
I just told you: because humiliating you will be fun.
原因自然是：羞辱你會很有趣。
Unless you mean extracting Regidrago, in which case, no, I won’t tell.
如果你問的是這整件事，抱歉，無可奉告。
Humans have this infuriatingly self-destructive need to tell secrets. I’m better than that.
人類有著強烈的洩密慾望，但我不會。
Well, I see the dialogue’s broken down fast.
行吧，已經談崩了。
Fine. Suffer.
那就開始受苦吧。
But I didn’t come here to engage in small talk.
但我不是來這裡閒聊的。
I assure you, it isn’t personal – no one has anything interesting to say. You’re no exception.
在這裡沒人有心情講笑話，無論是我還是你。
But you are exceptionally skilled, I understand, and that’s correlated with ego.
我知道你的實力很強，這也是你自負的原因。
Allow me to show you what you’re really worth.
但現在，就讓我告訴你為什麼是“自負”吧。
…Ah, so be it. I doubt I could drill humility through your thick skull anyways.
…好吧，那就這樣咯。看來我沒辦法讓你這油鹽不進的傢伙懂得謙卑。
You’re good at playing shallow games – good for you.
你只需要擅長玩這種簡單的過家家遊戲就可以了。
A Totem calls. I’ve seen more than enough.
圖騰在召喚我了，我也已經看夠了。
They got away. They won. A few that were masked, and whoever the hell THAT was. And Yezera…
他們贏了...也逃走了。包括戴著面具的人，那個傢伙，還有葉澤拉...
Wish I knew. That guy was a narcissist and an asshole, I can tell you that much.
我也希望知道。那個傢伙...自戀又愚蠢，我只能說出這一點。
The rest of them… who knows.
其他人…誰知道呢。
Could be anything.
任何可能都有。
But if they were after Regidrago specifically, and Yezera’s with them… maybe even leading them…
但如果他們特別在意雷吉鐸拉戈，並且葉澤拉和他們在一起…甚至領導他們…
…I don’t know. It doesn’t make any sense.
…我想不通，這不像她。
She should be the last person to pull this kind of stunt.
她應該是去阻止對方的人。
It is. It’s your problem now, and I know you aren’t gonna like that, but it is.
但現在，這是你的問題了，我知道你可能不太高興，\但是這是事實。
This is bigger than just one legendary Pokémon.
這不僅僅是一個傳說中的精靈這麼簡單。
Remember what I said about the big open secret?
還記得我說的那個公開的祕密嗎？
The caves around Makya are tombs for the Regis. The weird ones I was talking about before. Ones like this.
馬凱亞周圍的洞穴是巨人們的墓穴。我說的那些奇怪的東西，就像這個一樣。
Well, some archaeological teams went to study them a couple decades back.
幾十年前，一些考古隊去研究它們。
And then they found the Regis, and the rich mineral veins, and the ruins, and they figured they could leverage that.
然後他們發現了雷吉一族、豐富的礦脈和廢墟，他們認為可以利用這些資源。
We got some corporate backing from Andris and Mavis, and boom: Team Chasm. I was one of those original archaeologists.
我們得到了安德里斯和梅維斯企業的支持，於是裂隙隊應運而生，我便是最初的考古學家之一。
…Some of us. Helena wanted to run her own region. Andris wanted a piece of the organized crime bigtime.
…有些人想要的是...海倫娜想要屬於自己的王國，安德里斯想要成為國際犯罪組織的一份子。
Me, I study the Regis. And some people wanted me to leave well enough alone.
我只負責研究巨人，但有些人希望我別再插手。
I had a Team and Regidrago on my side, and they didn’t, so I got to study what I damn well pleased.
我有一支團隊和雷吉鐸拉戈的支持，但他們沒有，所以我可以研究我想研究的東西。
Some of us. I didn’t. I had five Regis – what did I need money for?
我有五個巨人，不需要經費，但其他人...
If I wanted lab equipment, I sent a list to Helena.
如果需要實驗室設備，就會把清單發給海倫娜。
I lived in a research station and ate ramen. Best days of my life.
我當時住在一個研究站裡，天天吃著泡麵...那是我一生中最美好的日子。
I just wanted to study the Regis, and with their power, nobody could tell me no. Funny how that works out.
我只想研究巨人，而且有了他們的幫助，就沒有人能限制我了。有時我也好奇是怎麼到那一步的。
You make it sound so pure and noble.
你讓它聽起來\如此純潔和高尚。
I was curious. Wanted answers. I got them – who could tell me no with Regidrago at my side?
我只是很好奇，才去尋求答案，我最終得到了想要的答案...又有了雷吉鐸拉戈在我身邊，還有誰能阻止我呢？
Not to mention the full might of Team Chasm, 'cause my research was VERY profitable.
再加上我還有強大的裂隙隊，再加上我的研究非常有價值。
I’m getting to that, but also, hey, it could come in handy some day, yeah?
我正要說這個，但是...也許哪天能派上用場，對吧？
As I was saying: we found the five lesser Regis.
正如我所說：我們找到了五個巨人的塑像。
It took me years, but I deciphered their inscriptions and understood their true nature.
我花了多年時間破譯它們的銘文，並理解了它們的真正本質。
That led us to Regigigas, and at that point we were cooking with gas.
這帶領著我們找到了雷吉奇卡斯，那時我也在加緊地進行研究。
Gigas was stronger than the rest of the Regis put together, and smarter, too.
雷吉奇卡斯比其他巨人加在一起還要強大，而且更有智慧。
Shape the earth, revert it back to some kind of primordial clay. Create seals and wards that nothing could get through.
它能夠重塑地球，將其恢復到某種初始...類似於黏土的狀態。還能創建沒有任何人能通過的封印和結界。
And, yeah, it could throw a mean Giga Impact.
我想，你也猜到了，它也可以發動猛烈的攻擊。
It could do… other things, too. We found a way to make it create ethereal Pokémon with its power.
它當然還可以做其他事情，比如說我們找到了一種方法，可以讓它用它的力量創造虛幻的精靈。
They were hostile, powerful – had to be locked away.
但是它們即強大又凶暴，我們只能將它們關起來。
And then by the time Yezera kicked down our door and told us to stop, she was basically just confirming what we already knew.
然後當葉澤拉踹開我們的門並讓我們停止時，她的所作所為基本上證明了我們已經意識到的事情。
We were playing with fire. If we kept using Regigigas, we ran the very real chance of destroying the world.
我們在玩火，如果我們繼續使用雷吉奇卡斯，將有無意中毀掉世界的風險。
Or at least permanently changing it. So we put each Regi back in their tomb and went legit.
起碼也是造成一些永久性的改變，所以我們把每個巨人送回它們的墓穴，然後依照規則處理好了一切。
The tombs were reinforced, of course – just about nothing can get through the minor Regi chambers.
當然，墓穴被加固了...幾乎沒有誰能穿過那裡的防禦。
Gigas’s chamber can only be opened by the other five Regis together.
只有其他五個巨人一起，才能打開雷吉奇卡斯的密室。
I don’t know. She agreed with us: it was too dangerous. We were criminals, not lunatics.
我不知道。她對這件事的看法，與我們沒什麼不同，我們的確做過錯事，但不是瘋子。
I know things… haven’t been great for her, but this? This is insane.
我也知道她的情況…並不好，但是這...這也太瘋狂了。
Who knows. We knew some groups were trying to get them back – they always have been.
誰知道呢，我們知道有些組織一直在試圖找回它們。
But succeeding? There was no way. Impossible. But… apparently Yezera can.
但他們不可能成功。只是...葉澤拉似乎是個例外。
…Probably. They might already have.
…可能吧。
Gigas’s chamber is deep down, though, and if they haven’t broken the seal yet, it’d be for nothing.
雷吉奇卡斯的密室在很深的地方，如果他們還沒有打破封印，那就是徒勞。
Or if they’ve resealed it. I can try and scout it out, but… no promises.
或者他們又重新封印了它。我可以試著偵察一下，但是…不敢說能發現什麼。
My POINT is that if you don’t help out, you better get used to the look of white stone.
我的意思是，如果你不幫忙，你最好習慣全是白色石頭的世界。
You’re gonna be seeing a whole lot more of it if someone tells Regigigas to let loose.
如果有人徹底解放了雷吉奇卡斯的力量，那周圍的一切都會變成白色石頭。
Listen, I don’t know. I don’t know a lot of things.
我不知道，我也不知道！很多事情我都不知道！
So let me talk to Andris, our rangers, Helena, whoever else I can find. We’ll figure out how bad things are.
我覺得應該去跟安德里斯，我們的義軍，海倫娜，還有其他人談談。這樣才能弄清楚情況有多糟。
And if these thieves show their faces aboveground, you can brawl with them.
如果這些小賊露面了，那就和他們打一場。
They’ve got at least one Regi, probably more, so there’s a strong temptation to wreak havoc. Trust me – I’d know.
他們起碼有一個...甚至更多巨人，這讓他們無法控制破壞的慾望，這一點我是清楚的。
Hate to say it, but you just need to keep being your usual self, kid.
雖然我不想這麼說，但你只要保持平常就可以了，孩子。
Or, no, I shouldn’t call you kid. Take this – you’ve earned it.
或者，不...我不應該叫你孩子了。拿著這個...你一定能用好它。
Used to give these to Chasm strike teams, for cave scouting.
以前給裂隙隊用的洞穴探測器。
It’ll get you just about anywhere in the region – nobody hides from you now.
它可以把你帶到這個地區的任何地方，現在別人對你來說都無所遁形了。
So go get those badges and save the day, hero.
所以繼續去拿徽章吧，然後拯救這個世界，英雄。

你以為我沒有自己的葉澤拉嗎？我說你會是第二重要的原因...我會為最重要的葉澤拉感到自豪。
This one’s beyond repair, though. You deserve better than a girl that’d destroy the world over her social anxiety. She’s quite literally insane.
至於這個已經無法修復了，你應該找一個比她更好的女孩，而不是一個因為社交焦慮而毀滅世界的瘋子。
Get rid of her and go back home to your Mavis. She’ll love you even more now that you’ve proven yourself so cleanly.
不要再管她了，回家找你的梅維斯吧。她會更愛你，因為你...已經證明了自己的清白。
She’ll give you a role in life to fulfill, and protect you forever. Even to the end of the world, you’ll have a place.

如果你用它還沒贏，我只有一個建議。
Look inward.

Being back at the Fin is pretty nostalgic.
真是令人懷念的地方。
Feels like just yesterday I arrived here in that rusty fishing boat, ready to take on the world as part of Team Chasm.
彷彿一切都還是昨天發生的 - 乘坐著那生鏽的漁船來到這裡，並作為裂隙隊的一員踏上征服世界的旅程。
And we did! Take on the world, that is.
並且我們成功了！我們征服了世界！
Not really in the way my younger self had intended.
只是...成果...跟我年輕時的願景差別有點大。
Have you been to the Starter Store in Novo?
你去過望新鎮的初行商店嗎？
It's the only place to get your hands on those highly coveted starter 'mons.

Problem is that they require a token exchange instead of just cash...
但是那兒只收代幣，不要現金…
Wish I had one of those instead of the Normal-types that fraud of a professor likes to give out...
如果給我哪怕一枚代幣，我都不需要去那個垃圾博士那裡，領一隻爛大街貨色的普通系精靈...
No thanks.

Yo, champ in the making!
嘿，未來的冠軍！
Samorn might not look like it, but she was one of Team Chasm's top battlers.
賽蒙可能看起來很和善，但她以前可是裂隙隊的王牌。
Her specialties are Dragon and Bug-types.
她所擅長的是龍和蟲，兩種彷彿很彆扭但又很搭的屬性。
That makes Ice-type your silver bullet. She'll have some answers for it, but it's still a counter.
所以最好的選擇是用冰屬性來應對，她對此有些應對措施，但仍然是一個好選擇。
Flying and Rock are your next best bets. Steel is pretty good as well, since it resists both of her typings.
然後比較好用的是飛行和岩石系，鋼屬性的精靈也不錯，因為可以抵抗這裡的兩種屬性攻擊。
Best of luck in the final stretch of your Gym run.
祝你在最後的道館好運連連。
Hoho! It's rare to see Samorn so lively.
吼吼，很少會看到賽蒙這麼活躍。
Watching you two go at it was inspiring.

My comrades have their own motives, but mine is simple.
每個人都有自己的動機，而我的願望很簡單。
The world at present is mercurial and deceptive. Human culture and technology serves as naught but a veil disguising ultimate truth.
目前的世界充滿了欺騙與變化，人類的技術與文化，都在掩蓋本應被大家知曉的真相。
Only the realm of ancient myth, tended by gods, untouched by humans, might let us perceive it. Do you not agree?
只有古老神話的領域，在神靈守護中，未曾被人類觸及，才得以讓我們觸碰到真實。你不同意嗎？
How disappointing, to dismiss it outright. If you have no eye for truth, then we have nothing else to speak of.
你竟然直接否定了這一切。既然你沒有看清一切的眼光，那也就沒什麼可說的了。
Forgive me this act of passion, but I expect a titan’s wrath may settle my raging heart.
請原諒我的情緒波動，但巨人的憤怒將會撫平這一切。
Regice, heed my command.
雷吉艾斯，聽我號令。
To the contrary: it has adamant support, if only one ruminates on the matter.
只要人們肯深入思考，就會發現這一切是對的。
Such wavering faith is nigh-useless for my purposes, alas. We require unflinching devotion.
但這種滿是動搖的信仰對我的目的沒有任何作用，我們需要更加堅定的信念。
*sigh* I would be forsaking my duty if I did not stall you at the least. Prepare yourself.
*輕笑聲*為了履行我的職責，起碼要拖延你前進的進程。做好準備吧！
I should encourage you to do so. Judge the weight of the world that is against the world that could be.
我很高興你願意這樣做，去評估世界的重量，對比真實與虛偽。
Alas, I know you will not ruminate idly upon it. You are a threat. That is intolerable to us.
但我不會就這樣等著，現在的你仍是威脅，我們無法容忍的威脅。
This shall be no decisive victory of mine, but I cannot let you pass unhindered.
我知道想要贏你並不容易，但也不能讓你輕鬆通過這裡。
…I should very much like to believe you.
...我也很希望能相信你。
If you speak truth, then I bid you repeat your convictions to Yezera herself next you meet.
如果你真是這樣想的，那下次見到葉澤拉時，請重複你剛才的想法。
She can see the machinations of your heart more clearly than I. Until then, you remain a trainer, as do I.
她比我更擅長看清別人內心的陰謀，但現在我們仍然是對手。
My enemy I smite, my ally I train. To either, en garde.
而對手，就是要擊敗的。
If you will not listen to my entreaties, then you are beyond salvation.
連最基本的傾聽都不願意，也就代表你已經無藥可救了。
Alas. Perhaps a titan’s fury will enlighten you to the clarity of the ancients.
唉，或許巨人的怒火，能讓你清晰地認識到這一切。
G’afternoon. Took your sweet time comin’ to find Yezera 'gain, didn’t ya?
下午好，為了來找葉澤拉，你也花費了不少時間對吧？
Got no interest in convincing you. Ain’t much of a preacher.
我沒有說服你的興趣，我也不擅長這種工作。
But I gotta set some ground rules 'fore we fight; establish some things. 'Cause we’re gonna fight. Ain’t no other way to it.
但在我們戰鬥之前，我還是得先說明一些事情。
Thank you kindly. I ain’t real interested in this cloak- and-dagger charade.
非常感謝，首先我對這種披著面紗的陰謀毫不感興趣。
I’m with Yezera, always.
我只是一直在幫葉澤拉做事。
Listen, I’m only gonna say this once: you oughta hear her out.
注意，我只說一次：你應該去聽聽她的意見。
Don’t care if you agree with her. Just hear her out.
無論你是否認可她的想法，只是去聽聽，應該不難吧。
And if you hurt her, I’ll make you wish Mavis stopped after Zain. We clear?
但是如果你傷害到她，我會讓你輸給贊恩的，明白了嗎？
Cocky li’l brat, ain’t ya? Tsk.
真是個自大的傢伙。
What’s so damn infuriating 'bout you is I ain’t just able to whip your sorry hide into submission. Too good.
然而讓我不爽的是，我沒辦法輕鬆擊敗你，你的確有些實力。
How 'bout I try anyhow? Titan’s gotta be good for somethin’, right?
所以就來試試吧，看看巨人擁有怎樣的力量。
Good. I ain’t 'bout ta repeat myself.
好的，我不想重複自己的話。
Now, I came here with a job to do, and I’m a reliable sort.
現在，作為一個可靠的同伴，我還是得完成自己的任務。
Sorry, kid. Yezera wants some peace 'n' quiet. Regice, lead us off, will ya darlin’?
抱歉了，小傢伙。葉澤拉現在不能被打擾，我得讓你放慢一些腳步。上吧，雷吉艾斯！
Hah. Take it from someone who knows, kid: you ain’t even scratched the surface.
哈，我只能以我的經驗告訴你，你甚至連表面都還未觸及到。
I can make you plenty more miserable if I set my mind to it.
只要我想，我還能繼續拖你的時間。
But, cheer up, kid. I’m 'bout to give ya what you always want: a good fight. Facing a Regi oughta cheer ya up. Heh.
不過，你應該想要一場優質的對局吧？面對雷吉艾斯，或許能讓你振奮起來。
Nah, I ain’t about to trust that. Ya don’t know jack about me and Yezera.
哼，我才不信這句話！你根本不瞭解我和葉澤拉的事。
Bickering old married couple, that’s what we are.
我們已經是經常拌嘴的老夫妻了。
Want to show me you’re with us? Tell it to Yezera.
如果要證明你的想法，那就把這些想法告訴她吧！
For now, I ain’t too keen on letting you off easy. Sorry. Beating folks into the dirt is my job, after all.
但現在，我不會讓你輕易脫身的，將你打得落花流水就是我的工作。
Ah, well. Guess no matter how hard I try, old habits die hard.
呵，好吧，不管怎麼努力，老習慣還是不肯消停啊。
Speaking of dying hard – lay down and quit moving, will ya?
說到這裡...現在得請你消停一下了。
Hah. They ain’t never been happy with my way of goin’ about covert ops.
哈哈，他們也覺得我不擅長祕密行動。
Too rough 'nd tumble. I ain’t built for cloak-and-dagger.
我行事太過直白粗暴。
So, let me tell you straight: you listen to Yezera. You hear her out. And don’t you dare hurt her.
所以，我就直白地告訴你了：去聽取葉澤拉的意見，傾聽她的想法，不許傷害她。
All I ask. And, uh, I wasn’t just sent here to chit-chat. You ready?
這就是我唯一的要求。當然我也不是來找你閒聊的，現在你準備好了嗎？
Oh, hello.
哦，你好。
Such a picturesque place to meet. If only it were under better circumstances.
在這麼一個美麗的地方相遇，如果情況能更好些就完美了。
Regice and I have unfortunately been told to make sure Yezera has no unwelcome visitors.
然而，我被要求來這裡，確保葉澤拉不歡迎的訪客無法繼續前進，所以我跟雷吉艾斯便在這裡等著了。
Before that, though… I know you’re more than a pretty face. You’ve got a spark to you. Will you listen to me?
我知道你不僅有好看的面容，還有著聰慧的大腦，所以在交手前能聽我說完嗎？
Aww. I knew I had a good feeling about you.
啊，我就知道你是個好人。
How do I explain it… well, I hate to use the word, but modern society is degenerate.
我該怎麼解釋呢…嗯...我不想用這個詞，但現代社會的的確確是墮落的。
We’re distant from the perfect moment of creation. We’ve kind of taken over the world.
我們遠離了神創造的完美世界，對一切掌握得過多了。
No respect for our elders – the primordial Pokémon that created the universe.
我們並沒有給予創造宇宙的精靈足夠的尊重。
Yezera’s going to reset this world back to its origins. And then humanity will be in the bosom of Arceus once more.
葉澤拉將會把一切回溯到起源，屆時人類將再次回到阿爾宙斯的懷抱。
Don’t call me insane. Although I’m sure this arrogant, faithless civilization would use that term.
不許用這個詞來稱呼我，這是傲慢又沒有信仰的文明才會用的墮落詞彙！
I’m merely devout, and devotion means making sacrifices. For example: you.
我只是虔誠而已，虔誠即意味著做出犧牲。就好比：你。
I really do like you, but… we all have to sacrifice sometimes.
我真的很喜歡你，但是...犧牲是絕對不可避免的。
Godlike Pokémon are now treated as not much more than beasts of burden.
那些神明一般的精靈現在都被看作是牲畜一般。
Avatars are destroyed at will because they’re “threats to humans.”
化身被肆意地摧毀，就因為它們是“對人類的威脅”。
The world has lost all respect, the divine essence from creation diluted and destroyed.
這個世界已經毫無尊重可言，神聖的本質被稀釋、破壞。
And since you seem to be no different, I can take some joy in this fight.
既然你也沒什麼不同，那就在這場戰鬥中獲得一些樂趣吧。
Arceus created the world. It is pure, and perfect, and resetting the world back to its original form will let us be pure and perfect too.
阿爾宙斯創造了這個世界，它是最純淨、最完美的，而重置後的我們也會變得純淨和完美。
I’d like to see myself blessed by the grace of our creator.
我想要得到神的恩典與祝福。
I’d like to see you that way, too.
我希望你也能得到這些。
In time.
時間差不多了。
For now, I’ve been ordered to remove you. Shall we dance?
我接到的命令是拖延你的時間，那麼現在，我們起舞吧？
Good. I knew I saw something in you.
很好，我知道你身上迸發出了什麼。
Some spark of faith. I’m a… very good judge of character.
那是一些信仰的火花，而我是一個...善於識人的人。
I’d love to just talk with you for a while, but I was explicitly instructed to stop you. So we’ll fight. Don’t take it personally.
我很想和你多聊一會兒，但我的任務是要阻止你，所以我們還是要對決，這跟我個人的情感無關。
Oh. Was I too forward?
哦，我太直接了嗎？
My emotions tend to get the better of me. I’m almost heartbroken.
我總是會被自己的情緒控制，我現在心都要碎了。
Well, I suppose I am a stranger.
也對，我現在是個陌生人。
Fortunately, I’ve been sent to ensure you make it no farther, so I have a convenient vent for all these feelings of rejection.
好在我的任務就是來拖延你，眼前正好有一個方便的出氣口，釋放掉這些被拒絕的痛苦。
Hello, friend. Yezera wishes to be alone.
你好，朋友，葉澤拉想要獨處一會兒。
To that end, I have been sent, and graciously afforded a titan to aid me.
所以我被派到這裡來了，還帶著一個巨人。
Before we attend to your removal, however, may I interest you in a short, frank discussion?
不過在我把你趕走之前，可以先做一個簡短的討論嗎？
I would rather like to try to convince you of the legitimacy of our position.
我想試著說明我們的立場是正確的。
Thank you for your time.
感謝你的時間。
Yezera’s goal is to recreate the conditions of the world shortly following its creation.
葉澤拉的目標是重現世界誕生後不久的樣子。
Modern science has attained almost complete understanding and mastery over the world – the modern world.
現代科學已經幾乎完全理解和掌握了現在的這個世界。
It cannot, however, understand the past. By reverting existence, we may study the universe from its conception and obtain universal knowledge.
但是，卻無法理解過去。通過回到過去，我們就可以研究宇宙開始的概念，並獲得寶貴的知識。
This is the only way to do so.
這是唯一的方法。
Without the reversion, humanity will never attain complete understanding of the universe. It is worth all prices.
如果不這麼做，人類將永遠無法理解宇宙，這些代價是值得的。
Now our time for conversation is up, however. Regice, please do the honors.
現在，交流時間結束，雷吉艾斯，開始行動。
All persons who attempt to advance civilization should care.
所有試圖讓文明得以推進的人都應該關心。
Universal knowledge is a prerequisite for an all- powerful society.
知識普及是使文明進入新時代的先決條件。
That is my goal. That is the goal of all science: to know, and to apply that knowledge.
這是我的目標，也是所有科學發展的目標：理解，並運用那些知識。
Your ignorance implies discussion will get us nowhere. Let us dispense with such, then.
你的無知也就代表著，我們的討論不會有任何進展，那麼就沒有繼續下去的必要了。
Knowledge will be retained into the new primordial era.
知識將被保留到新的原始時代。
We can rebuild at least small enclaves of humanity.
我們可以重建人類的小聚落。
From there our analysis and conquest will begin: a new society with absolute knowledge.
並以此為基準開始分析與征服，並發展為一個擁有絕對知識的新社會。
And, stemming from this absolute knowledge, absolute power.
同時，還會因為絕對的知識，擁有絕對的力量。
Consider it. In the mean time, there is the business I mentioned earlier. Excuse me.
考慮一下吧，與此同時，我也該執行接到的任務了。
I am glad you have the wisdom to agree. If you should wish to support us in our endeavors, I will be happy to have you.
我很高興你擁有這份智慧，如果你願意支持我們的事業，我很高興能有你的加入。
We will fight for a more enlightened era. For now, however, I must slow you. Business is business. Let us commence.
我們將為一個更開明的時代而戰，但現在，我必須阻止你。任務如此，讓我們開始吧。
I find this highly unfortunate. You will be left behind by progress.
這並不是一個正確的選擇，你將被進步拋在腦後。
If you would prefer to retain your ignorance, however, I cannot help you.
然而，既然你自願保持無知，那我也無能為力。
Prepare yourself. Regice, if you would.
準備好了嗎？雷吉艾斯，出擊。
Yo. Figure’d, uh, yeah, that you’d be here.
嘿，我就猜你會在這裡。
Yezera’s here. You keep running into her. She, uh, doesn’t really want to talk right now.
沒錯，葉澤拉也在這裡，但你總是打擾到她...她...呃...現在不想說話。
I got a job to do, but, uh, not keen on it.
現在這個任務...呃...我不太喜歡。
So you want to hear us out?
我該怎麼說呢…你有興趣聽聽我們的想法嗎？
Swear we’ve got some good reasons. Even if I’m not that good at putting it in words.
但是...你應該明白，我們不想與你敵對，你覺得呢？
Oh. That’s good. Great. Honestly didn’t expect that.
哦，那太好了！真的沒想到...
Well, I just figure we’ve done a lot of ordering Pokémon around.
我只是覺得我們不應該將那麼多命令強加給精靈。
Maybe it’s time to even up the footing a bit, y’know?
也許是時候讓我們站在同樣的地位上了，大概...
We can all kinda make up for whatever we did wrong.
我們有機會彌補以前所犯的錯誤。
The others have their reasons, but, uh, this is mine. Make a world where we can be forgiven. You get it?
其他人有他們自己的理由，但...呃...這是我的理由。創造一個我們可以被原諒的世界，你能理解我的意思嗎？
Well – fine. You know what? Fine.
好吧...你有自己的想法。
I don’t need your permission, and we certainly don’t need your help. Regice. Do ‘em in.
當然，我不需要你的認可，也不需要你的幫助，雷吉艾斯，幹掉他。
…You so sure? Takes a lot of pushing to train a team that strong in so little time.
...你確定？這麼短的時間內訓練出這麼多強大的精靈，這得需要多大的壓力啊！
But, yeah, no, I get it. Why would you help us?
但是，啊...我明白了，你並沒有幫助我們的理由。
Rich brat. Maybe we can beat some responsibility into you.
畢竟你是個富家子弟，你應該承擔起更多責任。
Uh. Don’t really know how to break it to you. You… don’t have time.
嗯，我不知道該怎麼說...你...沒有思考的時間了。
For one, we’ve already just about won. For two – think fast!
首先，我們已經快成功了，其次...我還有自己的任務。
Regice, sweep ‘em off their feet!
雷吉艾斯，把他解決掉吧！
Oh. Didn’t, uh, really expect that.
哦，沒想到會這樣。
Figured you were kind of a stuck-up brat. No offense.
我本以為你就是個自大的富家子弟...抱歉，請不要介意。
Well, good. Maybe we’ll be side by side one day, yeah?
好吧，也許有一天，我們會並肩作戰，對吧？
But, uh, for now… I’m supposed to fight you.
但是，現在...我應該和你戰鬥。
So, uh, sorry – ah, what am I saying, we live for this. Ready up.
所以，抱歉...啊，我在說什麼，都到這一步了...準備好了嗎？
Yeah, I guess that tracks.
哈，我覺得也會是這樣。
Fine. That’s… it’s fine.
好吧，沒關係。
I came here to beat the crap out of you anyways.
我來這裡就是為了揍你一頓的。
Odds are Regice isn’t gonna stick around much longer, so let’s make it count. Try your best, eh?
雷吉艾斯很快就要離開了，所以我要儘可能地利用好它。
Well. Had to happen eventually, I guess.
嗯...我知道遲早有這一天。
I’ve kinda sorta been planning what to say for the past few hours.
這幾個小時我一直在計劃要說些什麼。
But, um… I still don’t know. So can I just say what comes to mind and hope you understand?
但是，嗯...我還是不知道，所以我只能說出心裡想的話，你願意聽聽嗎？
Welp. Listen, uh, Makya’s kinda in a weird place right now.
嗯...差不多...呃...馬凱亞現在的情況很糟糕。
Team Chasm ran roughshod over this whole region and then kinda just… got away with it?
之前裂隙隊在這裡到處肆虐，然後就這樣...撂挑子走了？
So, uh, yeah, if you ever wanted proof that humans can’t get even the most black-and-white justice right, there you are.
所以，這就是人類甚至連正確分辨是非善惡都做不到的最直接的證據。
Would’ve been simple to fix that little screw-up. But they didn’t.
本來很容易就能處理這些問題的，但他們沒有這樣做。
So we’re taking the power away from humans, and putting it in the hands of Pokémon.
所以我們要把權力從人類手中奪走，交到精靈手中。
Is it? Is it!
啊？這就是答案嗎？
Am I insane for wanting some damn PUNISHMENT in this world?!
我就是希望他們得到應有的正義審判，是我的問題嗎？
Well, guess what. If people won’t give me it, I’ll MAKE it.
行，無所謂了，既然大家不願這麼做，那我就自己去審判。
And I’ve got just the tool!
而我有很好的幫手！
It is simple, you – you idiot!
這明明很簡單，你...你個白痴！
I can track down every ex-Chasm criminal and haul them up to the courts myself if I have to!
只要想這麼辦，我可以把每個裂隙隊成員，親自拖到法庭上受審。
They just won’t do anything if I did! So I have to do things personally, yeah?
但他們什麼都沒有做！所以我必須親自去做這一切！
Sorry. Nothing… personal.
抱歉，這不是個人恩怨。
Yes!
沒錯！
They’re noble and pure and – and – and they’d never let me down!
他們高貴而純潔...他們永遠不會讓我失望！
Unlike you! And everyone else around here!
不像你！還有你周圍的每個人！
You want to see? C’mon. See what kind of justice Pokémon can give!
要見識一下嗎？看看精靈能給出什麼樣的正義吧！
Oh. Ah-hah.
哦，啊哈。
Kinda got myself a bit worked up there… welp, no harm, no foul, yeah?
咳咳...有點激動…不過無傷大雅。
…Nah, that’s stupid.
…不，還是丟臉...
I’m not gonna waste this chance. I’ve got a Regi. You’re a prodigy. Let’s RUMBLE!
無論如何，我不會浪費這個機會，畢竟手裡有一個巨人，我們來戰吧！
Urgh, you make me so mad!
你讓我很生氣！
Nobody will frickin’ listen to me!
沒人聽我說話！
Fine.
好吧。
Y’know, fine, whatever.
好吧，隨你便。
You get what everyone else I fight gets. What you deserve.
你會在我這裡品嚐到應有的失敗！
Regice – your service has ended. If you would go, then go.
雷吉艾斯，你的任務結束了，你可以憑自己的意願離開了。
So it returns to its resting place… no matter. It has done all I desired and more.
它現在回自己的安息之低了...但它已經超額完成了我的目的。
As for you, we shall meet again.
至於你，我們會再見面的。
When and where, fate shall decide, though I think I know where we shall settle this.
命運將會決定我們何時再相見。
Do not pursue me. Your audience with Yezera awaits.
不要跟過來了，葉澤拉還在等你。
Seems Regice’s 'bout spent.
看起來雷吉艾斯已經快不行了。
Didn’t exactly expect them to be so squirrelly, but them’s the breaks.
沒想到你竟然這麼難纏，但也不覺得意外就是了。
Figure it’s headin’ back to its home.
它應該已經在回家的路上了。
One last thing, since you seem ‘bout ready to see Yez again: you hurt her and I’ll find you.
最後，既然你打算去見葉澤拉，如果你敢傷害到她，我會立即來收拾你。
And it won’t just be for some play fight with animals.
到時候就不是精靈之間的對決了。
G’evening, kid. I’ll be seein’ you. Keep in mind how nice it feels to be havin’ all your bones intact.
晚安，小傢伙，我們還會再見的，當我們再見時，希望不是你讓我怒不可遏的時候，好嗎？
Au revoir, Regice. Enjoy your entombment, I suppose.
再見了，雷吉艾斯，享受你的安寧吧。
And as for you, I’m breathless. Speechless. You’re even better than I imagined.
這真是一場激動人心的戰鬥，你比我想象中要強得多。
If you’d like to stop your pointless struggling against us, tell Yezera.
如果你想停止無意義的紛爭，就來找葉澤拉吧。
We’d love to have you. Until we meet again…
我們很希望你的協助，直到我們再次相遇...
I surmise Regice will now return to its tomb.
我想雷吉艾斯應該回它的墓穴裡面去了。
The titans are temperamental and ill-suited to existence outside their crypts.
巨人們的情況很特別，不能長時間待在墓穴外。
It is of no matter. Our victory comes soon.
不過這無關緊要，我們的勝利即將到來。
Yezera may be displeased in my performance, but she is understanding.
葉澤拉可能會對我的表現不滿，但她肯定能理解。
In the end, this will make no difference. Thank you for your time.
最後，我不會再阻攔你，謝謝你的時間。
See ya, Regice.
再見了，雷吉艾斯。
Ah, who am I kidding.
啊，我在開玩笑。
If either of us is gonna see it again, it’ll be you. Couldn’t really hold a candle to you.
果然我無法與你相提並論，我相信你或許還能再見到它。
Had to try anyways, just for Yezera. And I’m gonna have to do it again, right?
但我無論如何都要嘗試一下，只是為了葉澤拉。
Good practice, I guess. Well, think about it – everything, y’know? I’m out.
我覺得這是場不錯的訓練，現在我該走了，去思考一下這一切。
*sigh* So long, Regice. You never really were my type, anyways, so head on home.
*嘆氣*再見了，瑞吉艾斯，你從來都不是我想要的類型，所以你可以回去了。
And as for YOU, well, next time we talk it’ll be in a fair world!
至於你，下次，我們會在一個公平的世界裡交談！
If it isn’t, then, uh, I’ll have to buy us a li’l more time, 'kay?
如果不是的話...那麼...大概...那就再多給我點時間好嗎？
Until then, I’ve got judgment to be a-judging. So long, "hero."
估計我還要再努力一下了，再見，“英雄”。
No.
等下
Yes.
上前
I'll listen.
聽聽看
Don't need it.
不需要
No, I don’t.

That's tenuous.

I do.
我也這麼認為
Fine, talk.
說吧
Not interested in talking.
不感興趣
I know who you are.
我知道你是誰
Don't threaten me.
不要威脅我
Clear.
明白了
Wish that already.
願早日實現
I'm with you.
我會跟你一起
Alright, fine.
行
Go away.
滾蛋
That's insane.
神經病
Degenerate?
墮落？
Arceus's bosom?
阿爾宙斯的懷抱？
That's fair.
很公平
Sure, talk.
說吧
Don't really care.
不在乎
It isn't worth it.
不值得
Who cares?
誰在乎呢？
Society will crumble.
社會將崩潰
Good point.
說得好
Don't care.
我不在乎
You're wrong.
你錯了
I'm not guilty.
我沒有罪
Sure.
好的
Not that simple.
沒那麼簡單
Pokémon would do better?
精靈能做得更好？
Fair enough.
有道理

Eventually landed on Togepi as my main thing. Threw in the occasional Eevee when I felt like it.
我一般都會把波克比送給他們，偶爾也會給某些孩子一隻伊布。
Made a killing, you know. Didn't even need to get a new job when the Lab closed up shop.

No one knows why, but they've been doing it ever since the cave-in eight years ago.

Regigigas seems to falter, its resolve broken.
雷吉奇卡斯似乎動搖了，它的決心破滅了。
The primordial power within it dies down, and it regards you with calm eyes.
其中的原初力量消散了，它用平靜的眼神看著你。
Regigigas considers for a moment, perfectly still. Then it assents, moving with heavy steps to aid you.
雷吉奇卡斯沉思片刻，一動不動，然後它同意了，沉重地邁步前來幫助你。
Regigigas inclines slightly, perhaps imitating obeisance. Then it rights itself and stands at your side.
雷吉奇卡斯微微點頭，或許在模仿臣服。然後它站直了身子，站在你身旁。
Regigigas regards you with an analytical gaze. Then it hums and steps forward with certainty.
雷吉奇卡斯用分析的目光看著你，然後它哼了一聲，自信地向前邁步。
Regigigas thrums loudly and violently. Then it clenches one hand and flares with a bright surge of power for a moment.

Regigigas creates a Poké Ball and it willingly lets itself be caught.
雷吉奇卡斯創造了一個精靈球，它自願被你捉走。
The Poké Ball is abnormally heavy. Even the act of holding it seems to be of historical importance.
這個精靈球異常沉重，甚至拿著它能感受到歷史的意義。
You decline Regigigas’s offer. Regardless, it will not stand in your way.
你拒絕了雷吉奇卡斯的提議，不過，它不會阻擋你前進。
You decline Regigigas’s offer, at least for now.
你暫時拒絕了雷吉奇卡斯的提議。
Is this the right moment?
是時候了？
...You made it.
…你做到了。
This is where Regigigas was interred. Where I ended Team Chasm. Where I wandered in my boredom, and where I began to speak to Regigigas.
這就是雷吉奇卡斯被埋葬的地方，我終結了裂隙隊，在無聊中徘徊，開始與雷吉奇卡斯交談。
Told it what I wanted, what I feared, what I planned. And I heard it, lamenting the golden age.
告訴它我想要什麼，我害怕什麼，我計劃什麼，我聽到它在哀嘆黃金時代。
We reached an understanding. And then it started its work within its tomb while I collected the other Regis to finally set it free.
我們達成了合作，它開始在自己的墓穴內工作，而我則收集其他巨人，並最終釋放它。
I could fight you now, but, to be honest with you... I don’t want to take the risk. Don’t know what I’d do if I lost.
我現在可以和你戰鬥，但說實話...我不想冒險，我不知道如果輸了會怎麼做。
So I’ll wait at the heart of the new world and just watch it happen. Goodbye.
所以我會在新世界的中心等待，看著它發生，再見。
A bit of an anticlimax, I know.
有點令人失望，我知道。
...Sorry. I do like you. But I have to protect my own future.
...對不起，我喜歡你，但我必須保護自己的未來。
Yes, always. Motivated by fear. Forever.
沒錯，總是...受到恐懼的驅使，一直...
...Or at least until my work’s finished, and I can finally rest happy in a position of power.
...或許等我工作完成，就可以在權力的位置上安心地休息了。
You think I’d toss away my only chance at real happiness for you? Don’t delude yourself.
你認為我會為了你放棄我唯一的真正幸福的機會嗎？別自欺欺人了。
Besides, if you were going to change my mind... you know the only language I speak.
而且，如果你想改變我的想法...你知道我唯一會說的語言。
...No, I guess it wouldn’t to you. You’ll carve a path anyways, won’t you?
...不，我猜你不會這樣...你無論如何都會開闢一條道路，我沒猜錯吧？
Well, I’ll make sure it’s paved with thorns.
好吧，我會確保它鋪滿荊棘。
Regigigas, the future... the past... is quickly approaching.
雷吉奇卡斯，未來...過去...正在迅速接近。
Protect it. Protect me. I don’t want you to hurt my friend here, but... make sure they wake up in a better world.
保護它。保護我。我不希望你傷害我的朋友，但是...確保他們在一個更好的世界中醒來。
Help me.
幫幫我
This isn't right.
這不對
For the future.
為了未來
You owe me.
你欠我個人情
Catch Regigigas.
捕捉
Leave Regigigas.
算了
No.
還沒

是時候了
That's it?
就這樣？
Coward.

Don't do this.
不要這樣做
Doesn't matter.
無所謂了
[Map316]
Yo, yo, yo, what's a Trainer like you doing out here? Ain't nothing out here but sand and salt water.
喲喲喲，這個訓練家，你在這裡幹嘛？這裡除了沙子和海水什麼都沒有。
Hey wait a second...
等等...
Oh! You're that Trainer gramps was talking about!
哦！你就是老頭說的那個人！
Heard about you from a couple places. \PN, right?
我從好幾個地方都聽過你了，你是\PN對吧？
I'm Praveen.
我是普拉文。
You've got a spark of some kind if you took a dub off of ol' Ansel.
既然你能打贏安塞爾，證明你的確有些本事。
I gotta see some of that myself.
我也想見識一下。
I'm always ready to go, boss, you think you can show up?
我一直都在戰鬥狀態，你呢，準備好了嗎？
Must be the nerves, eh? I get that, can't always be on your A-game.
有些緊張？我能理解。畢竟誰也不能時時刻刻保持最佳狀態。
Let's get it started!
讓我們開始吧！
Whoo, a textbook battle. Should've gotten that on tape.
哦，教科書般的戰鬥，我應該錄下來的。
Alright man, you've got me impressed. Taking out Makya's best ain't an easy task.
好吧，你讓我刮目相看了，打贏馬凱亞最好的訓練家，可不是一件容易的事。
You look the type that's going places, yeah?
看起來你的確是一個有前途的新人。
Gonna want to meet this guy if you're trying to do that.
如果你想要獲得更進一步的成功，就得見見這個傢伙。
He's a bit on the wild side but that ain't anything new for you, I bet. I'm sure you two will get along well.
他有些野蠻，但這對你來說應該不難，我相信你們能相處得很好。
Well, no use hanging around here. Already got all the workout I needed for the day.
好吧，今天的鍛鍊就到這裡了，是時候回去了。
I'll try to catch you around, yeah? If not, well, have a great career I guess.
我會盡量來找你的，好嗎？如果不行的話，那就祝你事業順利吧。
I don't need a ship, I'm a natural swimmer!
我是個天生的游泳健將，根本不需要船！
A natural sinker as well...
天生的下沉健將...
I work on a boat because I need cash to live. If I could swim instead of eat, I would.

我的肱二頭肌已經超出了你能理解的範圍了。
The water here can get really deep! If I didn't have this tube, I'd probably drown!

I must rely on myself! I must get swimming lessons!

I trust this tube with my life.

I come here to relax with my Pokemon. Though, a battle or two won't hurt, either.
我和我的精靈來這裡，是為了放鬆下身心的，不過來場戰鬥也不錯。
The Skeevee Eevee needs us, I can feel it.
我能感覺到，愛布愛布伊布酒吧正在召喚我。
Maybe I'll see you there!
或許我們在那裡還會再見面！
That was fun! You should fight my sister, too. She's all the way at the start of the river!
真不錯，你要不跟我妹妹也來一場？她就在河的上游！
Good battling! You should fight my sister, too. She's all the way at the start of the river!
真不錯，你要不跟我妹妹也來一場？她就在河的上游！
Halt, in the name of justice!
站住，以正義之名！
I really gotta stop using that opening when stopping people for inspections...
這個開場白太尷尬了，以後必須得換一個…
No, I didn't want to battle you. Here's my badge. We heard that there was suspicious activity here.
誒呀，我不想和你戰鬥，這是我的證件，我們聽說這附近有可疑活動。
You see any crime lately?
你看到什麼犯罪活動了嗎？
No? Hmm, suspicious.
沒有？嗯？可疑...
I lost my glasses! Here, my Pokemon can help us find them!
我的眼鏡掉海里了！但是我的精靈可以找到它！
Aha! Found them! Now we can battle!
啊哈！找到了！現在我們可以開始戰鬥了！
...huh? Did my Pokemon battle on their own?
…嗯？我的精靈自己打完了嗎？
I still can't find my glasses...
我還是沒找到眼鏡…
I should really switch to contacts...
或許我應該換成隱形眼鏡…
Maybe get a guide Pokemon...
再或者換一隻導遊精靈…
A Shiny Corviknight!
是閃光鋼鎧鴉！
It's too busy watching the ocean to notice you.
它正忙著巡視海洋，根本沒注意到你。
Zarude stares at you with its arms crossed. After giving you a quick sniff, it locks eyes.
薩戮德叉腰盯著你，在快速聞了聞之後，和你對視了一下。
It probably wants to join your team. It gives a smile that's hard to read while holding up its Pokeball.

Not now.
稍等
Yeah, let's go.
來吧
No.
算了
Yes.
來吧
[Map317]
*sniff*
*輕笑聲*
Smell that? Smells like nerd in here.
聞到了嗎？這裡有一股書呆子的味道。
You ready kid? I'm gonna dunk you into the next decade.
準備好了嗎，小鬼？我要把你扣進下一個十年。
Damn it! I lost to this brat? Really?!
瑪德，我竟然輸給了這個小鬼...
Hey, kid.
嘿，小鬼。
Listen, I’m not gonna lie and say I wasn’t planning this.
我不會騙你說，從來沒有計劃成為冠軍。
I came here to become Champion, and so did you.
我們的目標在某些方面就是一樣的。
Had to end this way, honestly. But, uh, either way this goes… I don’t really care.
就此結束也是必然，不過，我並不怎麼在乎結果。
I just want to know. Get some closure.
我只是想...得到解脫。
Heh. Yeah? Finally catching on to the fact that this entire thing is idiocy?
哦，是嗎？你終於意識到整件事的荒謬了？
Sorry – I’m still an asshole.
但，抱歉...我依然是個混蛋。
And that’s your right. It’s your life, and, well, more than one way to skin a Liepard.
那是你的權利，是你的選擇與生活，而且，有很多解決問題的方法。
I promise I’ll give you a fight worth the title.
我會確保今天，給你一場值得稱讚的戰鬥。
Wouldn’t want you to. This isn’t a practice match.
我也不希望你放水，這不是一場無關緊要的練習。
This is the real thing. I’m going to enjoy it.
這或許是最為關鍵的一場，而且，我會享受這個過程。
Oh, no, we do.
為什麼？打還是要打的。
It’s fun. It’s fun and it’s a way to wrap this whole thing up. Closure’s stupid but it’s important.
這是整件事中最有趣的部分，也是結束一切的必要一環。
…I know Mavis is going to be watching our duel. Makes me a little sick.
而且...我知道梅維斯會看著我們這場決鬥，這讓我感覺有點噁心。
Don’t want it to be tainted by knowing I’m supposed to be "proving myself."
我不希望那些糟爛的爭鬥，玷汙我想證明自己的決心。
Nothing for it, though. One last battle? I’m not going to lose this one like all the others.
但沒辦法，最後一戰...我不會允許自己像之前那樣輸掉。
I’m going to lose it in my own way. Hah! Show me what you got, \PN. Show me who you are.
而是以我自己的方式“惜敗”，哈哈，讓我看看你的水準吧，\PN，向我展示真正的自己！
…It feels good to feel good after a loss.
...輸完的感覺太棒了。
Congratulations. You’re the Champion. Pretty big achievement.
恭喜你，成為了冠軍。這可是相當了不起的成就。
I know your job isn’t exactly over – I don’t have my head stuck in the sand.
我不是隻知道埋頭苦幹的懵子，知道你還有其他事要處理。
As your rival and as your opponent, good game. You beat me fair and square. Great job.
但現在作為你的競爭者，還是先恭喜你公平公正地擊敗了我。
As your brother, goodbye. I’m not gonna see you again for a little while.
接下來，作為兄弟，我估計得有段時間見不到彼此了。
I’m blocking Mavis on everything, picking a direction, and walking until I find something cool.
接下來我會在所有社交媒體上，屏蔽掉梅維斯，然後選擇自己要走的方向。
Thanks. Good luck to you too.
謝謝，也祝你好運。
I’d stay, but I’ve got faith you’ve got this whole fiasco under control.
我當然也可以留下來做些什麼，但我相信你已經有所準備了。
Gonna get a headstart on finding inner peace. Hah.
正好也樂得清淨。
Don’t flatter me.
別誇我。
It’s irresponsible... but, yeah, I need some time away.
硬說起來還是挺不負責任的...只是，我確實需要一些時間。
I hope you can do the same, honestly.
我希望你偶爾也試試。
Get away from Mavis, from the gyms, everything. It’d do you good.
遠離梅維斯，遠離道館，遠離這些給你壓力的一切，或許能讓你感覺好得多。
Can’t change my mind, kid.
我不會改主意的，小鬼。
Screw Mavis. Screw the company. Screw the gyms, screw the Championship, screw Makya.
特麼的梅維斯，特麼的公司，特麼的道館，特麼的競技大會，特麼的馬凱亞！
Gonna go find out what I’m actually interested in, 'stead of just trying to one-up you for mommy. But thanks for the concern.
我要去找自己真正感興趣的東西了，而不是為了讓媽媽高興，而試圖超越你，總之還是謝謝你的關心。
Don’t. Seriously.
別這樣。
I know she’s our mom, but she’s the reason we’ve been at each other’s throats. Or, uh, I’ve been at yours.
我知道她是我們的媽媽，但她就是我們一直相互敵視的原因，起碼是我敵視你的原因。
I’m getting away from her. She wants to talk, she can start by not pitting us against each other.
所以我會離開她，等她什麼時候意識到錯誤了，我也不會不給她機會。
…It is what it is, you know?
大概...就這樣吧。
You need me, you call, alright? I’ll pick up for you.
如果你需要我幫忙了，就直接給我打電話吧，你的電話我還是會接的。
Congratulations, Champion. Love ya. Go be a hero and kick some ass.
總之，恭喜你冠軍，愛來自你的哥哥，去當你的英雄吧，然後去踢某些人的屁股。
I had assumed we'd meet later in the Tournament, to be honest.
我本以為我們會在比賽後相遇。
Oh well, no use worrying about the seeding now. Just need to focus on the battle.
也好，這樣就不用再考慮那麼多，只要專注於戰鬥就可以了。
I'm going all in. Be ready.
我會全力以赴的，準備好了嗎？
Hmm, a disappointing result. Seems like I won't be the first repeat champion.
嗯，還是有點失望，看來我不能成為第一位雙冠王了。
Best of luck, it'll feel better to lose to the person who takes it all.
繼續加油哦，如果是輸給了最後的勝者好像也不差。
How d'ya do? Surprised to see me?
嘿嘿，看到我很驚訝？
Well, I ain’t 'bout to let this opportunity pass me up.
我是不想放過這個機會啦。
Don’t much matter to me if the world’s endin'. C’mon. Let’s have us a grand ol’ fight.
對我來說，末不末日的無所謂，起碼現在要來一場盛大的戰鬥！
How d'ya do? \PN?
啊，我知道你，\PN。
Heard a lot 'bout you. The name’s Alessa.
我叫阿萊莎，對你還算比較關注吧。
I’m a… call me an old friend of Yezera’s. Real interested to see if you’re as good as she claims.
我是…葉澤拉的老朋友，而且很想看看你是否像她說的那樣厲害。
Ya ready?
準備好了嗎？
Ain’t too surprised ‘bout that one. I tried my best, honest, but I ain’t your rival. Heh.
並不意外的結果，我盡力了，但仍不是你的對手。
Oughta leave you to Yez. Ah, well, I figure I might get a second shot at you.
我覺得你應該去跟葉澤拉來一場...到時候或許還會有下一次交手。
We’ll see, huh? I’ll be watchin’, kid.
會有那一天的，對吧小傢伙。
So y'are good, aren'tcha?
所以你的確還不錯。
Yezera ain’t much of a liar, but I figured maybe she got a li'l rusty.
葉澤拉從來都不會撒謊，不過或許有些生疏了。
Quite a team, kid. And quite a trainer they got. I’ll be watchin', kid. I’ll be watchin'.
出色的訓練家還有優秀的團隊，我會親眼見證你接下來的表現，繼續加油吧，小傢伙。
Good day.
氣色不錯。
Did you not expect the Dreadnaught to be here?
沒想到我會在這裡？
I’ve competed in every Championship since their inception. I wasn’t about to miss this one, avatars or no.
自從競技大會開辦以來，我每年都會參加比賽，不管有沒有化身的威脅，我都不會錯過這種盛會。
I want to face you. And now I can.
而且我也想和你再次交手。
It brings a smile to my face… though now that must be snuffed out, and my mind set… on the fight to come…
這讓我有種很興奮得感覺...不過現在得把這種情緒收起來，將思維集中在即將到來的對戰上了...
…Hmm. I lost. I don’t know why I expected to win so shortly after our last match.
…嗯，我輸了。畢竟距離我們上次交手也沒多久，想就此戰勝你未免有點異想天開了。
Ah well! It was fun while it lasted, and it was good to see you again.
好吧，雖然時間不長，但玩得很高興。
In a way, I’m glad I lost so decisively. If I’d become Champion, the hassle of dealing with the gym would be a nightmare!
不過，從另一個角度來說，輸掉對我來說也是好事，如果成為冠軍還要同時處理道館絕對是一場噩夢！
Goodbye, \PN. Come talk to me again sometime, though. My door is always open.
再見，\PN。有時間再來找我聊天，我家的門永遠為你敞開著。
Oh, hey. I didn’t think I’d get this far. I didn’t think – well, didn’t think a lot of things.
我從沒想過能走到今天這一步，我還沒...還有很多事沒準備好。
Doesn’t matter now. Win or lose, I’m ready to face you.
現在無所謂了，無論輸贏，我都要面對你了。
And, uh, I’m looking forward to seeing you give 100%. Let’s go.
我希望你也能全力以赴，現在開始吧。
Yo. I’m Eifion. You’re, uh, \PN, yeah?
你好，我是艾維恩。你是，嗯...\PN，對吧？
The kid who’s been running errands for Tamarind? Heard you’re, uh, pretty scary.
就是你在幫塔瑪琳跑腿？我聽說你很可怕。
About half the trainers I talk to have lost to you at some point or another.
我聊過天的訓練家當中，一半以上都輸給過你。
... I, uh, don’t plan on being one of them.
...嗯，我不打算成為其中之一。
Damn!
該死！
I – I gave my best. My team did too. All I can ask for.
我...我盡力了...這已經是我的全力了。
You too, you know? You’re doing great. Really impressive. I’ll, uh, I’ll try again next year.
你做得真的很出色，回頭我會再挑戰你一次的。
If there is one next year. Gonna be rooting for you anyhow.
如果有這個機會的話...但現在，我會為你加油。
Huh. Well, I see why you’ve got so many notches on your Poké Balls.
我想這就是你的精靈球上，有那麼多劃痕的原因了。
Somebody’s gonna humble you one day. Looking forward to seeing that – but I’m gonna root for you until then.
總有一天會有人讓你學會謙遜，但現在我會為你加油。
I like an underdog story, but I also like betting on the winning horse. G’luck, \PN.
我喜歡看到弱者爆冷，但也同時喜歡在高手身上下注，總之，祝你好運，\PN。
Figured I’d be seein’ you again. It’s been a little while, hasn’t it?
我就知道會有這麼一天，距離上一次交手已經有段時間了。
Seems like just yesterday you were showing up and showing down with me on Casaba.
雖然感覺起來彷彿還是昨天，好像你離開甜瓜島也沒多久。
I’m not about to go down so easy a second time.
總之，我不會輕易倒下的。
You ready? I am.
你準備好了嗎？我可早就準備好了。
Heh. Guess I never should’ve figured I could beat you.
哈哈，其實我從沒想過能贏。
I’ll be rooting for you, kid.
我會為你加油的，孩子。
Shouldn’t call you kid, I guess. Barely recognize you, honestly.
也許不應該叫你孩子，畢竟，你已經成長到我快要認不出的地步了。
Good luck. Even though I doubt you’ll need it.
祝你在接下來的比賽中好運。
Oh, well, look what the Shinx dragged in. \PN.
哦，看看誰來了，\PN。
Eight years ago, I lost to Yezera, and because of that Team Chasm fell.
八年前，我輸給了葉澤拉，並因此導致了裂隙隊的覆滅。
I’ve been training since then. I’m planning on redeeming myself among the scattered remnants of your team.
從那時起，我便一直努力訓練，並試圖在與你的對戰中，找回自己的失去的一切。
Nothing personal – I actually rather appreciate you. You’re just the most convenient point of comparison.
我沒有人身攻擊的意思...實際上我很欣賞你，只是將你作為目標比較方便罷了。
Now, let’s see if I can’t snuff out this child’s hopes and dreams.
現在，讓我們看看我能不能就此扼殺這個孩子的希望和夢想。
*sigh* I’ll need to see my dentist. I think I lost an inch of enamel to grinding my teeth that hard.
唉，我得找時間去看看牙醫了，剛才的局面讓我磨掉了一毫米的牙釉質。
What is it about you that makes you so infuriatingly adaptable?
你到底是怎麼做到這種程度的？
Fine. Fine! I’ll resign myself to the only thing I’m good at.
算了，習慣了，反正我還有其他擅長的事。
I’ll turn this region into an economic powerhouse, become even richer than Mavis, and buy LuxTech out from under her.
我會讓馬凱亞的經濟騰飛，我終究會比梅維斯更富有，買下她手中所有的光華股份。
Enjoy my petty revenge. And good luck with the Championship or whatever. I’m done here.
就當是我小小的復仇吧，希望你接下來的比賽也能好好發揮，現在，我該就此退場了。
Hello! Hale and hearty, I hope?
嘿，最近怎麼樣？
Oh, rest easy, I have no interest in the title. No, I am here because a champion is in the making, and they must be tested!
哦，你放心，我對冠軍頭銜沒什麼興趣。只是作為必要的一關，來這裡見證冠軍崛起而已。
Tested with fire! Tested with toxin! Tested with the unyielding agony that only the truest champion can withstand!
準備好應對火與毒的考驗了嗎？通過這場只有真正的冠軍，才能承受下來的痛苦考驗！
Now embrace it, and show me your worth!
那就去擁抱痛苦吧，展現你的實力與價值！
Blazing, brilliant, bearing both mercy and ruthlessness in equal measure!
熾熱、輝煌，同時還包含著仁慈和無情的特質
Ah ha ha! I’ll bow out now – now the role of the testing solvent belongs to you alone.
啊哈哈！我該退場了，後面還有其他的考驗等著你。
Enjoy it! Revel in it! I’ll be cheering for you.
好好享受吧！盡情沉浸其中吧！我會為你加油的。
Oh, it’s you! I’ve been waiting for this fight.
哦，是你啊！我一直在等待這場戰鬥。
You would not BELIEVE the time I put into training after you got our badge!
你想象不到我在你拿到徽章後，花了多少時間在訓練上！
If you’re thinking I’m just another rando, think again. Zoé and I got trained by Yezera herself back when it was her gym!
不要覺得我只是個普通人，我和佐伊都曾在葉澤拉的道館接受她的訓練。
Then I doubled down and went extra hard on training after you showed up. You are NOT prepared!
至於上次的失利，只是因為我還沒準備好！
You WERE prepared! Wow!
還是你準備得更充分！
That was… uh… yeah! Still got a long ways to go, I guess! Wow!
唉...呃...也對，我還有很長的路要走。
I’ll remember that one for a long time to come, lemme tell you. Gonna keep training, keep moving, keep working my way up the ladder.
我會記住這兩場戰鬥，會繼續加倍努力地訓練，繼續前進，繼續向著更高爬去。
Glad to see you. Keep rocking, 'kay? Can’t wait for the rematch!
總之，繼續加油吧，期待我們下一次的比試！
Same here.
我也是
Oh, I care.
我要贏
Won't go easy on you.
我不會手下留情
We don't have to fight.
我們未必要打
Good luck.
祝你好運
Good idea.
好主意
Don't.
別這樣
Mavis...
梅維斯…
[Map318]
The battles that take place each year are nothing short of inspirational!
每年，這裡的對決都令人感到振奮！
I may be a painter, but battling is my second form of art!
我是一個畫家，同時也是戰鬥的藝術家！
Fantastic! Marvelous! Outstanding!
太棒了！簡直難以置信！
Your style is so graceful, so forceful, so majestic! You deserve the title of champion!
你的風格是如此優雅，如此雄壯有力，你無愧於冠軍的稱號！
Nothing like a warmup scrim before the next round!
在下一輪比試前，最好熱一下身！
I've done what I set out to do: defeat every gym leader without losing a single 'mon, and never using any held items.
我已經完成那個了我的目標：在沒有精靈被擊敗的情況下，戰勝了所有道館館主，而且還沒有攜帶任何物品。
So, I guess I can't be too mad about scrubbing out in the very first round of the tournament...
所以...我不應該因為第一輪就被淘汰，而感到太難過
I heard you got a first-round bye, and were seeded in the opposite bracket from mine.
我聽說你被分到和我不同的小組了。
Means you'll get to avoid the guy who ended up sweeping me with his Serperior.
也就說你不會很快遇到那個用君主蛇橫掃了我的人。
He kind of reminded me of you, actually.
實際上，他讓我想起了你。
Anyways, I got time and I got frustration to vent. Battle me if you find yourself in the same situation.
總之，我現在有時間了，而且也想發洩一下挫敗感。如果你需要訓練的話，可以來找我。
Any fights between us now are just for the joy of battling. That persuasive enough, heh?
我們之間的所有對決，都只是為了純粹的對戰的樂趣，沒錯吧？
Understood.
明白了。
I'll be here until you wish to battle.
我會在這裡等你的。
My redemption is imminent. Surely.
當然，我的救贖之道，或許就在其中。
Yeah, you're definitely like that guy I fought.
沒錯，你跟那個人很像。
Results were just as expected. I'm just happy it wasn't too lopsided.
預料之中的結果，好在沒有被一邊倒的擊敗。
There's a nurse down there in the main lobby.
下面的大廳裡有個護士。
Hop on down there, and right back up to me so we can fight again, you hear?
下去，然後再回來，這樣我們就可以再來一場了。
Golly gee, if it isn't the Champion of Makya.
哦吼，這不是馬凱亞冠軍嗎？
I had great seats for watching that final battle.
我的座位位置還不錯，能看到最後的戰鬥。
That dingus was related to you, after all!
而且你跟那個傢伙是親戚！
Quite a fight. The energy in the crowd was electric.
你們打得相當精彩，觀眾們都沸騰起來了。
Frankly I'm honored to have seen your illustrious victory in person!
說實話，我很榮幸能親眼目睹你的輝煌勝利！
I'm going to take a break from traveling the region, and stick around here for a while.
我現在打算暫停自己的旅行，在這裡住一段時間。
A couple of battles won't hurt, though. I'll be right here, if the desire strikes you.

I even tweaked my team a little!

Wait. If I beat you now, do I become champion instead?

That was a champion-tier victory, all right!
這是一場冠軍級別的勝利！
If you still feel the need to prove yourself, the previous champions are all still in Makya.
如果你覺得有必要繼續證明自己，以前的冠軍們也都還在馬凱亞。
Fighting them would be fun, I bet!
我覺得，跟他們打一打一定很有趣！
I avoided worrying about the Avatar Crisis during my gym challlenge. I don't think my skill set transfers too well to fighting them.
我一直投身於道館挑戰，也因此避免了跟化身危機的交集，而且我也不太適合跟它們戰鬥。
But I'm worried now, though.
所以我現在有些擔心。
I bet people'll be falling over themselves to give you healing items, now.
我覺得現在會有很多人，爭先恐後地送給你東西。
Not me, though, I still gotta do things the old fashioned way. I'll need time to do that, if you don't mind.
但我不會這麼做，還是得按老辦法來。你不介意的話，稍微給我點時間。
\PN, eh? How do ya spell that?

My old rival once set up his sweeper even though I had no chance to recover.
我的老對手曾在我毫無準備的時候，將我在賽場外橫掃出局了。
"Why did you set up on me?" I asked, "I was already walled."
“你幹嘛，誒喲？”我問他，“我還沒準備好！”
My rival smiled, "You were swept before the game started; the set up is the whole point."
他只是笑著說：“在比賽開始前你就沒有資格了，準備工作才是重中之重。”
One night while meditating, I was approached by a Chasm grunt who demanded my possessions: my items, my Pokemon, the shirt off my back.
那天晚上，我正在冥想，一個裂隙隊的人過來，索要財物，把我的物品、精靈和衣服都搶走了。
I quickly complied. Now naked and cold, I resumed meditation.
我並沒有反抗他，而是赤身裸體，繼續冥想。
"My poor fellow," I said to myself, "I wish I could give you my skill, too."
“的確我現在失去了財富”，我對自己這樣說，“但他搶不走我的技術。”
My old rival predicted my every swap until I became afraid to pivot.
我的老對手每次都能猜中，我要換哪隻精靈。
"How do you guess correctly every time?" I asked.
“為什麼你總能猜到？”我問他。
My old rival smiled. "I limit your options until you have only one choice," my rival replied.
他笑著回答道：“我會限制你的可選項，當你只有一個選項可行時，
"And then you have no choice at all."
這個選擇就是必然。”
"Why do you play worse the closer you get to the finish line?" my old rival asked.
“為什麼你越接近終點時，發揮得越差呢？”我的老對手這麼問我。
I thought for a moment and replied, "because I'm afraid to lose."
我想了一會兒，答道：“因為我害怕失敗。”
My old rival smiled. "Are you sure you're not afraid to win?"
他笑著問我：“那你就不怕贏嗎？”
I met my old rival at a petting zoo. He was talking with one of the baby Skiddo and struggling to hold back tears.
那次我在寵物園區遇到了我的老對手，他正努力忍著眼淚，跟一隻小坐騎山羊說話。
I asked him, "are you doing okay, friend?"
我問他：“你還好嗎，夥計？”
He shook his head solemnly. "Everyone forgets that goats are herd animals. We're not meant to be alone."
他鄭重地搖了搖頭：“大家都忘了山羊是群居動物，我們註定不會孤獨。”
"I'm playing terribly," I told my old rival. "I'm not going to win."
“我表現得很差，”我對他說，“我贏不了...”
"This too shall pass," he replied.
“都會過去的。”他這樣迴應。
That night I beat the gym and raced to tell him, "Thank you for your advice. I cannot tell you how happy I am right now."
那天晚上，我挑戰了道館，然後高興地告訴他：“謝謝你的建議，我沒辦法表達現在有多高興。”
My old rival smiled. "This too shall pass."
然後他笑著說：“都會過去的。”
The battle strategies that all the Trainers here use are so complex.

這些設備安裝起來太麻煩了。
I swear, a fifth of each year's budget just goes towards replacing stuff that got hit by a stray Hydro Pump or Fire Blast...

O-oh. I hope you'll feel better soon.
哦，希望你很快就會感覺好些。
Or was that like, an ego thing? Well, I suppose I'm not in a spot to say anything about that...
還是出於自我吹噓的原因嗎？嗯，我想我沒有資格對此發表任何意見……
I think I'll just hang out here and catch up on the matches later.

起初，我並不知道為什麼來到這裡，或者我希望能找到什麼，只是知道我必須來。
And then... then it fell upon me like some grim scavenger upon a fresh corpse.
然後…它像陰森的食腐鳥一樣，突然襲來，落在了我身上。
Don’t you understand? I walked these graves, pacing with an ever-quickening heart, hunting for the one name I dreaded to find.
你不明白嗎？我走過這些墳墓，心跳越來越快，尋找那個我害怕找到的名字...
Mine.
伊莫珍。
...There is nothing much to say to a dead woman, is there?
…對於一個已死去的女人，沒有什麼可說的了，對吧？
Don’t be. It’s better to know the truth.
別難過，知道真相總比糊里糊塗的好。
...Imogene is dead.
…伊莫珍已經死了。
I do not know if I ever did. Countless possibilities plagued me in sleepless hours.
我不確定自己是否曾經想過這種可能性，在我失眠的時候，有太多想法一直困擾著我。
Was this one too elegant to consider? Or too cruel?
還是說覺得這個結局...太過優雅，或者太過殘忍，所以不願意去考慮？
Imogene has been dead for years. She died well before my memory on the train.
伊莫珍已經去世好多年了，在我擁有火車上的記憶之前。
She was a hermit and a recluse, a mystic and a witch, and now... gone.
她是一個隱士，一個神祕的女巫，現在…已悄然離開。
I can feel... memories... bubbling up. They’re seeping in like blood through thin gauze.
我能感覺到…記憶…正一點點地冒出來，像血液一樣從輕紗中滲透進來。
I can’t let them in. I mustn’t!
我不能讓它們進來，不能！
If I remember who I am... I won’t be me anymore. I won’t be Imogene.
如果我記起我是誰…我就不再是我了，就不再是伊莫珍了。
...It is agonizing.
…這太痛苦了。
The silence, filled with the beat of my raging heart and the echoes of things I had thought left to blissful oblivion.
我的心跳，和曾經以為已經遺忘的一切，就在沉默中以回聲的形式，充斥在我的耳畔。
No! You would kill me?
不！你會殺了我嗎？
If I remember I will be – I will be undone! Unmade in an instant!
如果我記起來，我會被毀滅！瞬間被毀滅！
So I believed.
我曾經是這樣認為的。
Hah! How innocent I was, truly, never having witnessed something so horrible as to make one wish to forget.
哈！多麼天真...從未見過如此可怕的事情，以至於讓人寧願忘記。
I’m trying. I am trying with all my might!
我正在努力這樣...儘自己的一切！
I do not want this identity! I do not want this past!
我不想要這個身份！我不想要這個過去！
If I witness this revelation it will shatter me! I know this with utmost certainty.
如果我目睹這個真相，它肯定...會撕碎我！
And... so did she.
而且...她也是這樣想的。
I do not know if she has already given in, but she bestowed upon me a gift before she left my presence for what I fear is the last time.
我不知道她是否已經屈服，但在她離開我之前，她送給我一份禮物，這可能是我最後一次見到她了。
Her Pokémon.
她的精靈。
She would not entrust them to me if she planned to return.
如果她打算回來，她不會把它們託付給我。
...I am prepared. I can run no longer.
...我已經準備好了，我不能再逃避了。
Willing or no, the truth descends upon me. I will greet it with all the fury I might yet muster.
無論是否願意，真相都將降臨在我身上，我將用我所有的憤怒來迎接它。
Make your preparations, if you must.
如果你也...做好準備。
Are you ready? I cannot do this alone. I require a mirror to gaze into.
你準備好了嗎？我自己是做不到的，我需要一面鏡子來看看自己。
I must dance, must ritualize this, must make into something comprehensible.
我必須以儀式舞蹈完成它，必須使其變得可理解。
I need your support, and I know your adamant core resides within your abilities as a trainer.
我需要你的支持，我知道你堅定的心深深紮根在你作為一名訓練家的能力之中。
More than that, I know it is how you judge people. I would have you witness my soul, and know the truth.
更重要的是，我知道這是你評判人的方式，我想讓你見證我的靈魂，獲知真相。
Do what you must. I may wait a few moments longer... may keep the past at bay.
隨你自己的意願去做吧，我可以再等一會兒…可以讓過去晚一些來。
For the last time, I take up this identity I have absconded with.
這是我最後一次使用這個我曾經偷走的身份。
I am Imogene.
我是伊莫珍。
I am an oracle.
我是一名先知。
I am a seeker of truth.
我是一名尋求真相的人。
Bare your soul to me, wanderer! Let this be my last battle!
向我展示你的靈魂，旅行者！讓這成為我的最後一戰！
...So be it.
…就這樣吧。
I remember.
我想起來了。
I remember the house, the old hardwood, the ticking of the grandfather clock, the smell of the river loam!
我想起了那棟房子，那些古老的硬木地板，那座老爺鐘的滴答聲，那河邊泥土的氣味！
The crushing of the drying autumn leaves, the warmth of a soft embrace, the bruising, the bleeding, the burning, the fight!
那些被踩碎的秋葉，柔軟擁抱的溫暖，那些傷、血、燃燒還有爭鬥！
The love of the fight! The yearning to learn, to become something more!
那種熱愛戰鬥的感覺！那種渴望學習、成為更好的自己的感覺！
I remember her. I remember Imogene teaching us, teaching all of us... teaching us to be...
我想起她了，我記得伊莫珍教導我們，教導我們大家…教導我們成為…
Go on ahead.
你先走吧。
Find what has happened to my sister in this torment.
去找出我姐妹在這場災難中發生了什麼。
I... I will release our Pokémon, and then I will cease this long masquerade.
我…我會放走我們的精靈，然後結束這場漫長的偽裝。
I will be trapped no longer.
我不會再被困住了。
The name on this gravestone is faded beyond recognition...
這墳墓上的名字已經模糊不清了…
Leave me. I must do this alone.
讓我一個人離開吧。
There’s a note.
這裡有一張紙條。
“I’ve released them. Our Pokémon go readily. I think they know. As for me... I remember. She loved Dittos. She kept dozens.
“我已經釋放了它們，我們的精靈很願意離開，我想它們也知道了，至於我…我想起來了...她喜歡百變怪，養了好幾十只。
She trained them not only in battle, but to imitate humans. To imitate... her.
她不僅訓練它們參加戰鬥，還訓練它們模仿人類，模仿…她自己。
I found it so curious, to see Pokémon pretending to be people. How lovely. How fun!
我覺得很奇妙，看到精靈假裝成人類，多麼可愛，多麼有趣！
She took me in as if I was just another pink blob, and she taught me more than I can express, let alone repay.
她像對待我的方式，也像對待她們一樣，她教給我很多東西，我無法一一列舉，更無以為報。
I am not her, nor is my companion. We are but two mirrors set facing each other, endlessly reflecting a woman that is gone.
我不是她，我的姐妹也不是...我們只是兩面鏡子，不停地照出一個已經離去的女人。
We strayed further and further in our imitations every day. It could not last. Do not mourn for us.
我們每天都在越來越遠的模仿中迷失自己，這本就不能永遠持續下去，不要為我們而感到悲傷。
This is the truth, and it provides suffering and succor in equal measure, as it always does.
這就是真相，它帶來了同等的痛苦和安慰，一如既往。
We are released from our bonds. We are Imogene no longer.
我們不再受到束縛，我們不再是伊莫珍。
Now we are Imogene, sisters of a name, and that is all.
但我們又都是伊莫珍，同名的姐妹，僅此而已。
Thank you.
謝謝。
Goodbye.
再見。
P.S.: I have done things I should not have, in pursuit of this truth. I have endeavored to cause harm to you, to others, to the world entire.
附言：為了追求真相，我做了不該做的事情。我曾試圖傷害你、他人和整個世界。
I do not know if this was my own selfish need to know what in my heart of hearts I already saw yet denied --
我不知道這是否是我的自私，如此想知道我內心深處已經看到但卻否認的東西...
or if, perhaps, Imogene was not the saint I remember her as.
或者，也許伊莫珍也不是我記憶中的聖人。
In either case, I will take responsibility for what I have done.
無論哪種情況，我都會為自己的所作所為負責。
I cannot stand against you, and will gladly aid you in your coming trials. Not to aid the flow of fate, but because you are my friend.
我不能反抗你，我將樂意幫你度過即將到來的考驗。不是為了幫助命運的流轉，而是因為你是我的朋友。
Because it is the right thing to do, and because it is what I want.
因為這是正確的事情，也是我想要做的事情。
I cannot ask for more than a chance to make amends side by side with one such as yourself.”
我不能要求更多，只想有機會與你並肩修補我的過錯。”
P.S.: I will gladly lend my aid to you, no matter who I am.
附言：無論我是誰，我都會樂意幫助你。
Ask for my assistance, and I will be there. I have plenty strength yet to give.
只要你需要我的幫助，我就會在這兒，我有足夠的力量可以幫你。
I do this not for you, who is of import to the flow of destiny, but for you, my friend and confidant.
我這樣做並不是僅僅因為，你對命運的流轉很重要，而是為了你，我的朋友和知己。
Bring me with you if you desire my company, or have need of my powers.
如果你想要我的陪伴，或者需要我的力量，請帶上我。
It is the least I can do... and the best I can imagine.”
這是我能做的最少的事情...也是我能想到的最好的事情。”
...A Mew.
...一隻...夢幻。
The infinitely-mutable Pokémon of myth, here in the flesh.
它就等在這裡，活生生地出現在面前。
It chitters happily, swimming through the air.
它歡快地吟唱著歌謠，在空中游曳。
Yet, somehow, there’s a macabre tinge to its movements, a slight touch of gallows humor to the way it darts around gravestones.
然而，不知怎麼的，它的動作帶著一絲可怕的氣息，它在墓碑周圍飛來飛去，嘴角還帶著一絲笑意。
There is a flash of sympathy in its eyes when it stares into yours.
當它凝視著你的時候，它的眼中閃過一絲同情。
It knows what it is, and it knows what you are, and you know what it is.
它知道它是誰，也知道你是誰，同時你也知道它是誰。
It stops and coils, floating for a moment to regard you with its vibrant eyes.
它停下動作，漂浮在空中，用它充滿活力的眼睛凝視著你。
You see the conflict in its eyes –
你可以從它的眼中看到矛盾...
the desire to explore free and wide, the remembered thrill of the fight, the eagerness to repay its debt, the desire to accompany you.
探索自由和廣闊的渴望，對激烈戰鬥的回憶，償還自己錯誤的渴望，以及陪伴你的願望。
It leaves the choice to you.
它把選擇權留給了你。
It winks at you as you catch it.
當你抓住它的時候，它向你眨了眨眼。
Sometimes it will go missing, wandering on flights of fancy through landscapes and thoughtscapes alike.
有時它會失蹤，漫遊於各種風景和思緒之中。
Sometimes in the witching hour objects will move on their own.
有時在午夜時分，周圍的物品會自行移動。
Sometimes you find notes written in handwriting you can’t read, signed with a question mark.
有時你會發現用你看不懂的字體所寫的便條，簽名都是一個問號。
You know it can leave any time it likes. It won’t.
你知道它可以隨時離開，但它不會不辭而別。
It flips upside down, then rights itself in mid-air.
它翻轉過來，然後在半空中恢復了平衡。
Perhaps mockery, perhaps a nod, perhaps just an idle motion of a recently-freed animal.
也許是嘲弄，也許是讚許，也許只是一個剛剛釋懷的生物的閒散動作。
Then, it’s gone.
然後，它就消失了。
A mirage that disappears with a strong breeze, dispelled like a waking dream.
像初醒的夢境一樣，隨著一陣強風消散了。
If you come back, perhaps it will be here, waiting for you. They’ll say this place is haunted, but you know the truth.
如果你回來找它，也許它還會在這裡等你，人們會傳言這個地方鬧鬼，但只有你知道真相。
It’s always liked graveyards, and it can afford to wait to make sure you won’t need it.
它一直喜歡墓地，而且它有足夠的時間等待，以確保你確實不需要它。
Now, it has nothing but time.
現在，有的只剩時間了。
I BRING A WHOLE NEW MEANING TO DEATH METAL!
我給死亡金屬帶來了全新的含義！
Now that I think about it, what I'm doing down here is immensely disrespectful.
現在回想一下，在這裡做這種事有點不好。
TAKE THE G OFF OF GRAVEYARD BABY!
給墓地一個G大調！
BWAHHHHH BWAAAAHHHHH BWWOOOW!
啊 啊 啊 啊 哦 哦 哦 ！
Are you alright?
你還好嗎？
Which one are you?
你是哪一個？
What did you see?
你看到了什麼？
Where's the other one?
另一個在哪裡？
...
。。。
I'm so sorry.
抱歉
How?
怎麼回事？
Yeah, I'd guessed...
嗯，我猜到了…
You have to remember.
你必須記起
Better to know.
得知總好過未知
Then don't remember.
那就不要回憶了
I'll prepare.
我準備下
Very well.
好的
Catch Imogene.

Release Imogene forever.

Would you like to catch this Phione?
要抓住這隻霏歐納嗎？
You leave the Phione for now.
你讓霏歐納離開了。
Yo! Shoulda known I was gonna find you here. Um, yeah, how’s it going?
哈，我早就猜到會在這裡遇到你，最近怎麼樣？
Good, good, yeah, me too.
挺好，啊，我也挺好的。
Sheesh. I get that. Things are kinda... kinda rough now, yeah.
啊，我能理解。畢竟最近...不太安寧對吧。
Hey, I mean, can’t hope for much better than that, right?
呃，我覺得，這也就代表還不錯是吧？
Hah! Yeah, yeah, I get that. Same here, honestly.
哈哈，沒錯沒錯，我最近也有這種感覺。
But, um, you competing? I mean, obviously, but, yeah, great to see you here.
你是來這裡參加競技大會的嗎？不...明顯就是來參賽的...我是說...很高興見到你。
Sorry, I’m rambling. I’m kind of a nervous idiot before a challenge.
抱歉，我在說什麼...臨近比賽了，我有些緊張。
I barely scraped past Samorn, honestly, and I’m not super sure how well this is gonna go.
雖然我勉強打敗了賽蒙，但我真沒有太多自信。
I, uh, I hope I get to face you.
而且...呃...我很希望能跟你對決。
Good. I want to see you at full power, y’know? Take off those training weights.
好的，我希望你能全力以赴，就像把訓練用的負重丟掉那樣。
I thought of it on the way over and was like, oh, wow, I might actually be squaring off against you properly.
其實在路上的時候，我就想到這個問題了，或許這次真的要跟你正面對決。
Hah! You really take this seriously, huh? But, nah, I wouldn’t bet on me either. I know my place.
哈哈，看起來你很認真啊，但是...呃...好吧，其實我...自己也不覺得我能贏下來，我還是有自知之明的。
Aww. Don’t want to hurt my feelings? I mean, it’s not like you have any reason to be scared of me.
嗯？你怕傷害我的感情？起碼我不覺得自己有實力讓你感到害怕。
If we do face each other, I... yeah, let’s be clear: I’m gonna lose.
如果我們真的正面相遇...我...沒錯，我肯定會輸。
But I’m going to try my best, and if I make it close, I’ll be happy.
但是我也會盡力而為，如果我能讓比賽變得焦灼，也算是不虛此行了。
Sometimes you just gotta say “well, I’m not the best person in the room, but that isn’t gonna stop me.”
那句話怎麼說的來著：“無法取得桂冠，也要一往無前。”
Um. Yeah. So, uh, I don’t know if you noticed, but… this isn’t my Phione.
差不多吧，記不太清了...嗯...另外...我不知道你是否注意到了...這不是我的霏歐納。
Yeah. So, uh, my Phione laid an egg, and that egg hatched into this li’l thing.
我的霏歐納下了一個蛋，然後這個小東西就孵化出來了。
My Phione’s napping right now, but this rascal is full of energy.
至於我的那隻現在在睡覺，而這個傢伙則充滿了活力。
This one’s a bit more feisty. It’s got this, I don’t know, devil-may-care attitude.
這個小傢伙更加好鬥，它有那種...應該是...參加魔鬼訓練的覺悟？
My Phione’s pretty chill. Maybe it’ll mellow with age? This one just hatched, so who knows.
而我的霏歐納要冷靜很多，也許這跟年齡有關？畢竟這隻剛孵化出來。
Yeah, no worries. I didn’t really expect you to.
哈哈，我明白，我也沒指望你能分清。
This little rascal just hatched from an egg – my Phione’s a bit more chill, a bit more mellow. This one’s a real fighter.
這個小傢伙剛從蛋裡孵化出來，我的霏歐納更加冷靜，溫和，而這只是一個真正的鬥士。
No, no, mine is napping. This is a newly-hatched Phione, complete with youthful rebellious attitude.
沒有，它現在在睡覺，這是一個新孵化的霏歐納，有著年輕人獨有的叛逆。
Which, y’know, cool, I guess.
怎麼說...這...也挺酷的？
But, uh, yeah. I’ve got a spare Phione.
總之...呃...這隻霏歐納現在並沒有主人。
I don’t know how useful the squirt will be to you, but if you want it, I’d be more than happy to give it to you. I know you’ll care for it.
我不知道這它能對你有多大幫助，只要你想要它，我也樂意把它給你，我知道你能照顧好它。
I hope it helps you out somewhere, sometime. It’s looking for a fight. I know it.
希望它能在某個時候幫到你，畢竟它也在尋求一場戰鬥，就像它一直表現出來的樣子。
No? Alright, well, maybe you’ll get a second chance if you change your mind.
不打算帶上它？好吧，如果你改主意了，也許還會有第二次機會。
Anyways, yeah, tournament is kicking off, so bye for now. Maybe I’ll see you in there.
總之，競技大會要開始了，就此別過，或許我們會在賽場重逢。
Hope so. And then – oh, yeah, I almost forgot. My Phione’s been wanting to visit the water recently.
然後...哦對，我差點忘了！我的霏歐納最近想去水邊。
I just... I know it. It needs something. Somewhere special.
我只是...我知道...它應該想要某些東西...去某個特別的地方。
I’ve heard about some kind of deep spring or river or something around the <imp>base of the Eleig river</imp>.
我聽說在<imp>埃利格河附近</imp>有一眼地下深泉。
I’m gonna try and find it after the Championship wraps up. I owe it to Phione.
等競技大會結束後，我就會去試著尋找它，畢竟我還欠霏歐納一個人情。
So... yeah. So long, friend. Hope I’ll see you around.
那麼...就這樣了，朋友，回頭再見。
Take the Phione.
帶上霏歐納。
Don't take the Phione.
不要帶霏歐納。
Good.
挺好。
Poorly.
不好。
So-so.
一般。
It's complicated.
難說。
Same here.
我也是。
Hadn't considered that.
沒考慮過。
You won't win.
你贏不了。
I hope I don't.
算了吧。
Oh?
哦？
Something seemed off.
不對勁。
Can't tell them apart.
我分不清。
Wandered off again?
又走丟了？
[Map329]
I wonder what drink I should get...
我要喝點什麼呢...
A battle is best enjoyed with a can in hand.
看著比賽來罐啤酒，應該就是最佳體驗了。
Oh... the tournament's already over?
啊？比賽結束了？
I took too long to decide what I wanted to drink...
挑飲料挑太久了...
Oh! You're one of the Trainers entering the Tournament!
哦！你是今年參加競技大會的訓練家之一！
Could you do an interview with us? We've been asked to cover the competition.
你能接受我們的採訪嗎？我們是對比賽進行報道的記者。

Yes! I - I mean, thanks for doing this.
好誒！呃...我是說，很高興你願意接受採訪。
So, you're \PN, you've blasted your way through the Gym Challenge in record time. We haven't seen anything like that since the first champion.
所以，你是\PN？那個突破了道館挑戰記錄的訓練家？這是首位冠軍的記錄第一次被打破。
So what's the secret? What do you think makes you head and shoulders above the other rookies?
你有什麼祕訣嗎？你覺得你為什麼比其他人更優秀？
How wholesome! Your Pokemon must really love you!
看來你和精靈之間的關係，已經非常親密了！
It's just that simple, huh? You really do have it down.
就這麼簡單嗎？
A little confident I see! I'm sure your fans will be glad to hear that you feel good coming in.
真是自信的發言啊！我想粉絲們肯定很欣賞這種風格。
Huh? I see you're feeling a little cryptic today.
哈哈...既然是祕訣肯定不能透露是吧！
Next question. You've racked up a few brownie points with the Rangers for your efforts in defeating the avatars.
下一個問題。據說你經常幫助義軍，應對各地的化身威脅。
Any tips for those helping with the crisis?
對於那些應對危機的人有什麼建議嗎？
A solid tip! Make sure your team compositions are up to snuff if you want to take 'em out.
沒錯，如果你想打敗它們，就得確保它們有足夠的水準。
The best defense is a good offense, am I right? Just gotta start a stampede to take one of them down.
最好的防禦就是進攻，對吧？在它們反應過來之前消滅他們。
You heard it here folks! Stock your Aid Kits and keep at it.
大家聽到了嗎！備好急救包，繼續努力。
W-what? You mean like, the avatars are causing you duress? Profound. I think.
好，很有精神！看起來化身也對你造成了不小的麻煩吧，我覺得。
Alright, last question. If you could say one thing to your fans at home, what would it be?
然後是最後一個問題。有沒有什麼想跟粉絲說的話？
I'm sure you will. Plenty of new fans will come in after seeing you in action, I'm sure.
我相信你的決心，我想大家也會期待你接下來的表現。
Going in strong, eh? Not too shabby for this year's star rookie.
要強勢出擊？今年的新秀勢頭很猛啊。
You sure do! I'm sure they'll be excited to finally be recognized for once.
當然有，而且還會越來越多。
W-well, sure, of course it's a real place. Tons of people move to Makya from there.
呃...當然是真的...很多人都是從那邊搬來的...
Well, no more questions for you \PN.
今天的採訪到此結束，\PN。

這簡直是千載難逢的才華，我已經把身家全都壓上了。
Dunno what they look like though. Gotta check that when their matches are broadcast.
不過還不知道他長什麼樣子，等比賽轉播的時候再看吧。
It was you, the whole time!
原來就是你啊！
I've never felt so smart and so dumb simultaneously.
我從來沒有過現在這樣，同時覺得自己聰明和愚蠢的時候。
Either way, I won big on that bet, so you deserve a slice of the pie.
總之，我贏了不少賭注，這也有你的功勞。
I don't have cash on me right now, so you'll just have to take this instead.
但現在我手頭沒有現金，所以就拿這個吧。
I'll be watching your career with great interest.
我會繼續關注你的職業生涯。
I'll take your Pokémon for a few seconds.
請允許我暫時拿走您的精靈。

Kalos is a rather competitive region.

Even then, it doesn't have nearly enough events for my family.

So we tour all the nearby regions each year.

Excellent battling. I especially loved your team choices.
出色的表現，我特別喜歡你的戰鬥風格。
No touching the MP.

I wish I could be enjoying myself here, but I'm absolutely miserable.
我希望能在這裡盡情享受，但現在心裡全是痛苦。
What kind of woman ditches her fiancé to hook up with a "professional trainer" she just met?
到底是什麼樣的女人，會直接拋棄自己的未婚夫，去勾搭一個剛認識的“專業訓練家”？

No thanks.

My older sisters like battlin' a whole lot.
我的姐姐們都很喜歡戰鬥。
Trainers always come through here. The lady with the Combees sometimes asks as well, so they get a lotta practice.
這裡經常會有訓練家經過，有時那個帶著蜜蜂精靈的女士也會在這邊走，所以她們的實戰經驗很豐富。
They're always so cool when they're battlin'. I wanna be like them when I'm older.
她們戰鬥時的樣子太酷了，我以後也要成為這樣的人。
[Map332]
[Map333]
The venom I could spit about the Corviknight that abandoned me here...
我無法抑制心中對那個將我扔在這裡的鋼鎧鴉的怨恨...
That damnable raven! I've gone dizzy turning here and there through the hedges.
那隻可惡的烏鴉，害我在這裡面轉來轉去，頭都要轉暈了。
What a battle! A testament to your skill as a slayer.
好一場戰鬥！這證明了你作為殺手的高超技藝。
The gap between our skills is quite large. I'm not sure I'll ever be able to bridge it.
我們所掌握的技巧差距很大，我不確定什麼能夠彌補。
Still, how droll! A little bit of happy chaos to liven up this awful day.
不過，這還是挺有趣的！一點混亂中的快樂，讓這糟糕的一天變得生動多了。
At this rate, I'll arrive in Sweetrock Harbor by next May...
照這個速度，等明年五月我就能回蜜巖港了...
There truly is no justice in the world.
世界上果真沒有公平可言。
Perhaps that one Corviknight just has a chip on it's shoulder.
也許只是那個鋼鎧鴉有什麼不滿。
I always give my judgement on their coloration, but none before have mustered any sort of answer.
我經常通過它們的膚色來判斷，它們到底哪個更靠譜一些，但是並沒有一個準確的答案。
I must have chosen the sole bad guy among them.
或許我只是恰巧選到了那唯一一個壞傢伙。
And all because I listened to the advice of that man in Novo Town.
就因為我輕信了那個望新鎮的傢伙。
A beautifully carved statue of the legendary king Calyrex.

Oh? There's something hanging from the statue!

Bud's the name and hedges are my game! Both plant and financial!
我的名字是小蕾，樹叢與籬笆就是我的遊戲，既是植物也是財務！
Now if you'll excuse me, I have some bushes to trim and some stocks to option.
恕我失陪了，我還有些樹枝需要修剪，還有些股票需要購買。
Bud's the name, but battling sure ain't my game...
我的名字是小蕾，但我的戰力可不像一個花蕾...
I'm the 28th Bud Hill, a long lineage of gardeners that have maintained the Floral Maze.
我是第28任“峰之花蕾”，是守護鮮花迷宮的園丁！
It may not look like much, but this is one of the longest maintained structures in all of Makya.
雖然看起來不怎麼起眼，但這裡是整個馬凱亞存留時間最久的人類造物。
I've been wandering for hours. If I don't find the exit soon, my skin will dry out!

I feel very Croagunk-esque right now...
我感覺自己要變成不良蛙了...
I must have some moisturizer on me somewhere...

A map would have been nice to have...
如果有地圖就好了...
[Map334]
Oh?
嗯？
They’ll come with me. I couldn’t convince them to stay even if I wanted to.
他們會跟我一起走，即使我想讓他們留下，也說不服他們。
They’ll keep me safe, I know that much.
他們會保護我的，我知道...
I imagine Artemisia and the rest have given you plenty of trouble before – you know how much they love me.
蒿蒿他們以前...肯定給大家帶來了很多麻煩...你知道他們有多愛我。
They’re the best Pokémon anyone could ask for.
他們是任何人都想要的最好的精靈。
They’re used to me disappearing. At least this time I have a good reason.

My mom will worry, but she knows I can take care of myself.
我媽媽會擔心...但她知道我能照顧好自己。
Alessa... she’ll be the first person I talk to when I get back. I miss her already.
阿萊莎…她會是我回來後第一個說話的人...我已經有點想她了。
But she’s used to it. She’s a better friend than I deserve.
但她已經習慣了，她是我應得的好朋友。
No. I can’t.
不，我不能。
Consider this my exile, or my recovery, or my finding myself. However you need to frame it.
把這看作是我的流放...或者我的康復...或者我的自我發現...不管你怎樣說都好。
Sometimes I just... need to disappear. And I can’t think of a better place to disappear.
有時候我只是需要消失...而我想不到一個更好的方法來消失了。
Like I said – I’ll return. This wasn’t our last battle.
就像我說的...我會回來的，這不是我們的最後一戰。
Oh, \PN. You’re going to make me cry again. Don’t – don’t make me cry again.
哦，\PN。你又要讓我哭了，不要...不要讓我再哭了。
...I love you. I don’t mean that in any certain way, I just... I love you.
...我愛你。我...並沒有什麼其他的含義，只是...我愛你。
Thank you. Awww, \PN. I’m crying. *sniff*
謝謝，啊...\PN...我又哭了...*抽泣*
Are you ready to go?
你準備好了嗎？
Your Pokémon...?
你的精靈？
Your friends...?
你的朋友？
Please stay.
請留下來。
Hug her.
擁抱她。
Not yet.
還沒有。
Yeah.
是的。
[Map335]
The people upstairs don't know jack.
樓上的人什麼都不懂。
The real sauna is right here at the source.
真正的桑拿就在這裡。
Sitting in the water, I'm safe from all the wild Pokemon.
坐在這些水中，也不用擔心被野生精靈打擾。
I help manage the wildlife down here.
我負責管理這裡的生態系統。
The sauna's heating is actually an ecosystem in and of itself.
來確保全天然桑拿的穩定運行。
The Pokemon here feed on grass and minerals.
即便這裡的精靈都以草或者礦物質為食。
We occasionally have to tamper-- a shipment of food here or catching a few Pokemon there...
也需要我們偶爾干預一下，運送一些食物或捉走部分精靈...
But it's surprisingly low cost.
怎麼說也比人工桑拿成本低。

A locked door. It has a slot for a keycard.

You insert the Team Chasm ID Card.

The door unlocks with a click.

However, it no longer holds any drinks.

[Map339]
[Map340]
Are you ready?
你準備好了嗎？
You arrive even here undeterred… but not unforeseen.
即便到現在都無法阻止你...當然我也不是沒有料到。
You have heeded Yezera’s invitation even should it bring you into the most dismal abysm of this entire region.
你接受了葉澤拉的邀請，即便這會把你帶到這個地區最淒涼的深淵。
Do you fancy yourself a hero? Do you bear a grudge? Or are you enamored with the idea of facing a former Champion?
你認為自己是英雄嗎？還是對某些事情懷恨在心？或者只是想要面對一位前冠軍？
Pray, do not tell me. I would delight in divining the answer myself.
請不要告訴我，我更願意自己猜出答案。
I fear I must. Yezera may have invited you, but I extended no such hospitality.
我恐怕必須告訴你，雖然葉澤拉邀請了你，但我並不會向你提供的款待。
You two may have your rendezvous in a world of primordial truth.
你們兩個可以在一個原始真理的世界裡會面。
Now, allow me to peer into your heart.
現在，讓我窺探你的內心。
I shan’t allow you to continue a step further. A world unveiled by mortal deception awaits me.
我不會讓你再往前走一步，一個揭示騙局的世界正等著我。
I will not permit you to deny me my enlightenment.
我不會允許你否認我得到啟迪的權利。
Shall we commence with the inevitable? I grow weary of waiting.
我們開始不可避免的戰鬥吧，我等得有些厭倦了。
The hearts and minds of humans are trivial to decipher – with my acumen, at least.
人類的心靈，至少對於我的敏銳來說，是微不足道的。
Even discounting my auguries, the soul of a true Trainer is laid bare in battle.
即使不考慮我的占卜，一個訓練家的靈魂也會在戰鬥中裸露出來。
Show me what passion drives you, hero.
向我展示你的激情吧，英雄。
Do you take my idiolect for the mark of pretension?
你認為我說話的方式是虛偽的標誌嗎？
As you please. Dismiss my words as insipid or overwrought as you wish – I have no need to converse with you any longer.
隨你便吧，你可以把我的話視為乏味或者過度，我也不再需要與你交談。
Shall we speak in your native tongue? I am more than fluent.
用你最能聽懂的語言吧？恰好，我也很擅長這個。
You’re late, kid. Ain’t got no manners, keepin' a lady waitin' like that.
你遲到了，小傢伙。讓女士等待很沒禮貌。
Hah! Ain’t talkin' 'bout myself – meant Yez.
哈！我說的女士不是自己，而是葉澤拉。
Don'tcha gimme that smile. She’s right fine when she’s dolled up, and more than that, she’s my friend.
收起你這份笑意，她打扮得好的時候很好看，而且她是我的朋友。
You’re gonna give her your respect, y'hear me?
她應當被尊重，明白？
Now, got some bad news for ya: I ain’t lettin' you have your last dance with her if I can help it. This ends now.
現在，我有些壞消息告訴你：如果我能阻止的話，我不會讓你和她最後起舞，到這裡就結束了。
Glad to hear ya hearin' me. Now, kid, I ain’t 'bout to pull any punches.
很高興你願意聽我講話，但現在，我不會手下留情的。
'Cause you’re sweet and oh-so-polite, I ain’t gonna break anything.
不過，因為你的禮貌，我不會打傷你。
But you’re pickin’ a fight with Yez, so I’m gonna leave you with some bruises. You 'bout ready? Put ‘em up, kid.
但你畢竟在阻撓葉澤拉，那就留下一些淤青吧。準備好了嗎？放馬過來吧。
Ah, you’re such a babyface. Real cute one, too.
啊，你的臉真的很和我的胃口。
Kinda kid you take home to meet your parents, y’know? Shame I’m gonna have to put you six feet under.
我挺想把你帶回去見父母的，但現在我得讓你下地獄。
Hah! I kid, I kid – I ain’t doin’ wetwork. Anymore.
哈哈！我開玩笑的，我不會再做得那麼極端了。
I ain’t lettin’ you get away without a few bruises, though. Ready? Go!
但是我也不會讓你毫髮無損地離開，準備好了嗎？
Hey – listen, she’s – don’tcha try goin’ and flusterin’ me.
你...聽著，她...別讓我分神。
Had to haul that girl to prom, mind ya, and she wears a nice dress a mite better than yours truly.
每次不得不帶她去舞會時...她穿上禮服都比我好看多了。
My point is that’s she’s a right fine lady, and ya better respect her like one.
總之，要把她當做女孩子看待，像對待一位女士一樣尊重她。
Agh, ya got me distracted. Quit with the psyops and fight me proper.
啊，我不該分心想這些...別用心理戰術了，跟我好好打。
Hah! Whatever you say, kid. I ain’t 'bout to take that metaphor and run with it.
哈！隨你怎麼說，我只不過是做個比喻罷了。
You want to get to her, ya go through me. Call me cliche but that’s my line about it.
你想接近她，就得先過我這關，雖然老套，但這就是我的底線。
I guess ya could say I’m reserving the first dance. Hah!
你也可以說，我是在準備序曲，哈哈！
I like you, kid. C’mere. Lemme beat that humor out of you.
說實話我挺喜歡你的，但現在得把你的幽默打出來了。
Hello there. You arrived just a teensy bit earlier than I expected – I was writing a poem, see. Never to be finished, tragically.
你好，你來得...比我預期中要早一些...我正在寫一首詩，可惜永遠無法完成了。
These black arches of stone like a starless sky will soon be replaced by brilliant alabaster, which, well, ruins the central symbolism.
這黑色的拱門像是沒有星星的夜空，很快就要被華麗的雪花石膏所代替，可這卻破壞了中心的象徵意義。
What a shame. I assume you’re going to force me to duel you now?
真可惜，我猜...你現在要逼我跟你決鬥了吧？
You march into my demesne, hauling your well- trained combat creatures with you.
你闖進我的領地，帶著你訓練有素的戰鬥寵物。
We’ve fought before. You’re completely opposed to my beautiful dream. And you still want to claim I have a choice in the matter?
我們以前就交過手了，你還反對我的美好夢想，我又怎麼有選擇的權力呢？
Don’t insult me. You’ve made your choice, and now we have to deal with the consequences.
不要侮辱我了。你已經做出了選擇，現在我們必須承擔相應的後果。
Ah, well. At least you’re honest. I like that about you. You’ve got such... clarity.
好吧，至少你很誠實，我喜歡你這一點，喜歡你如此清晰的思路。
What a gleaming light in this dreary cave. Why, that could almost be poetic! If only we had a hopeless romantic to write that down.
在這個陰暗的洞穴裡，總有一束閃亮的光芒。這似乎也可以寫成詩！如果我們能有一個陷入絕望的浪漫主義者來記錄一切就好了。
Alas, I’ll be too busy directing my passions into carving your team apart.
唉，我不得不將我的激情投入到分化你的團隊當中。
Of course! You’re such a brilliant spark in this region. You deserve odes... sonnets.
當然！你在這個地區是如此傑出的一束光，你應該得到頌歌…得到十四行詩。
On the other hand, the fact that you’re here now against me instead of alongside me means that you’re not as special as I thought.
另一方面，你現在站在我對面而不是和我並肩作戰，這意味著你並不像我想象中那麼特別。
No faith. It’s a shame, really! I don’t want to do this! But I will.
沒有信仰，真是可惜！我不想這樣做！但我必須要做。
And, since I have to... might as well enjoy it.
既然我這已經是定局…那就享受一下吧。
What? You think a poetic soul is creepy? Does true faith disturb you?
什麼？你認為有詩意的靈魂很可怕嗎？虔誠的信仰讓你不安嗎？
Genuine emotions uncompromised by the endless drudgery of society? Fine!
不被無休止的社會勞作所侵擾的真實情感讓你感到不舒服了？
Enjoy where that narrow-minded view gets you. Namely: here, about to lose to me.
好吧，享受那種狹隘的看法吧。也就是說：你將在這裡輸給我。
Hello, friend.
你好，朋友。
We have already begun. Regigigas will quickly remake the world.
我們已經開始行動了，雷吉奇卡斯將很快重塑世界。
I understand that you are here to face Yezera, but unfortunately I can’t allow that.
我知道你來這裡是為了見葉澤拉的，但很抱歉我不能允許。
There is a non-zero chance of your success, and I am not a gambler. If you would like, we can both stay here and talk until the reversion overtakes us.
你成功的機率接近於零，但我不是賭徒，不會選擇放任。如果你願意，我們可以一起待在這裡，直到逆轉影響到我們。
I supposed as much. Excuse me, but in that case I must fight you.
我也是這麼覺得的。不好意思，但在現在這種情況，我必須和你戰鬥。
Universal knowledge is approaching. I would like to be there to witness it – alone, if possible.
真正的知識正在接近，我想在那裡見證它...如果可能的話，我也想獨自一人。
I do not either. Unfortunately, I can tell from your tone that we are, in fact, about to duel.
我也不想，不幸的是，我可以從你的語氣中感覺到我們確實將要決鬥。
I am unwilling to let you go further, and I am unwilling to lose. Please understand... and please consider conceding.
我不願讓你繼續前進，也不願輸給你。請理解…並考慮認輸吧。
That is the most I am willing to say pertaining to your odds against Yezera.
如果你要直面葉澤拉，這已經是保守的估計了。
She is conventionally regarded as unbeatable when she applies herself, though I am aware that you have broken that convention repeatedly.
只要她想，她就是無敵的，儘管我也聽說了，你已經多次打破了慣例。
Now, may we end the discussion of theory and add another data point?
現在，我們可以結束理論討論，再引入另一部分數據嗎？
Excuse my verbosity. If you would like to go straight to our duel, we can.
請原諒我囉嗦，如果你想直接進行決鬥，那就來吧。
I would not insult your intelligence by pretending we will not fight. That much should be evident.
我不會侮辱你的智慧，假裝我們不會打架，那沒有什麼意義。
Shall we?
開始吧？
Oh, uh, hey. Listen: I’m gonna cut right to the chase.
哦...嗯...我直奔主題了。
You beat me once. You beat Yezera, um, a lot.
你曾經打敗過我，也打敗了葉澤拉，嗯...很多次。
Though, some of those don’t really count, 'cause she was using someone else’s team and – whatever.
雖然其中一些場次，因為她用了別人的隊伍，或者其他什麼原因而不能算數。
Point is, I can’t beat you. But… I gotta try. I’ve got a lot to answer for, y’know?
但問題是，我打不過你，也還是...必須嘗試。我有很多問題要解決。
Lotta little things I did that I got to make up for. Can’t you just let me have this?
我必須去彌補自己曾經的過錯，你就不能讓我得到這個機會嗎？
Of course you can’t. Can’t let me have anything, can you?
沒錯，我知道是這個答案，你什麼都不會讓給我。
Ugh, I was gonna be Champion! I was really gunning for it, too. And then... yeah. Everything.
我本來那麼努力，就要成為冠軍的！但是...沒錯，一切都玩了！
You completely overshadow me in every way. I can’t beat you. But I’m gonna try to hurt you.
你很多方面都超過我了，我打不過你，但我會用其他方式！
Maybe to you. But not to them – not to Pokémon. They’re the ones who have to forgive me.
對你來說可能是這樣，但對它們來說不是...不是對精靈來說，是那些必須原諒我的人。
It’s time for them to stop taking orders and start being treated like equals. That includes from ace trainers like you.
是時候讓他們不再接受命令，被平等對待了。這也包括像你這樣的頂尖訓練家。
I know you can’t stand that, so... I guess we gotta fight. Sorry... but I’m not sorry.
我知道你不能容忍這一點，所以...我想我們得打一架，抱歉...但我不後悔。
I don’t. Not most of the time anyways.
大多數時候我不會這樣。
I’m trying my best to make things right. Can you say the same? Going around keeping the status quo?
我正在盡我最大的努力去改正曾經的錯誤，你敢說這樣的話嗎？你只是在維持現狀。
Is this the world you want? I guess you’re a rich brat, so... yeah. Life’s easy, life’s good.
這是你想要的世界嗎？你是個富家子弟，所以...沒錯，沒有壓力，生活美好。
Hmph. I’m gonna try and make it a little harder for you, if I can.
哼，如果可以的話，我會讓你的生活變得更艱難一些。
Sorry. Guess I’m a spiteful bastard.
抱歉，或許我就是個惡毒的混蛋。
No! I’ll fail – I’ll gladly fail – but I’m not about to give up. I’ve got friends that need protecting.
不！我會失敗的...我很樂意失敗...但我不會放棄。我有需要保護的朋友。
I’ve got stuff in my past I need to make up for. And I’ve got a world that needs building.
我有需要去彌補的過去，有需要去建設的世界。
A better one – one that’s more equal, more fair. Sorry it isn’t what you want, but I won’t just roll over for you.
一個更好的世界...一個更加平等、公正的世界。對，這不是你想要的，但我不會因此而屈服。
You ready?
準備好了嗎？
...Hey. So, uh, this is it, huh?
...嘿。這在這裡了，對吧？
You’re, like, not gonna have a change of mind? No justice? No fairness? No punishment?
你不會...大概...改變主意對嗎？忽略了正義、公平和懲罰？
Oh, who am I kidding – you’re Tamarind’s lapdog. You’ve been doing her dirty work since, like, literally day one!
呵，是我看走眼了...你就是塔瑪琳的走狗，大概...從一開始就在為她做事！
Guess what that means! That’s right: time to pay!
你知道這意味著什麼嗎？沒錯：是時候付出代價了！
That’s what they all said. You’re not a team grunt! You’re just, like, a temporarily inconvenienced mastermind!
沒錯，他們也這麼說，你不是這個團隊的普通士兵，你...大概...是個...暫時失去權勢的策劃者！
Ugh, you’re all the same. Well, I’ve chewed through a lotta grunts. No different this time!
呵，你們都一樣，我已經幹掉了很多士兵了，這次也不會有有什麼例外！
Nope! But I really really want to!
不，我真的真的很想打你！
Tamarind’s out of my reach, but you’re, like, the second-best thing. So c’mere so I can give you a bloody nose.
既然我打不到塔瑪琳，那你就是最好的選擇，過來讓我揍你一頓。
If you were sorry you’d stop fighting me, idiot!
如果你真的抱歉，就別再繼續了，白痴！
You’re such a – such a dolt! How can I get it through your thick skull that you’re the bad guy? Can I beat it into you? Wanna find out?
你真是個...蠢貨！我怎麼才能讓你明白你是壞人？我能把這些打進你的腦袋裡嗎？
Oh, I swear, I’ll roll up these sleeves and deck you myself if I have to! I swear, if you chip my nails I’m gonna kill you for real!
如果必須的話，我會捲起袖子親自揍你！如果弄壞了我的指甲，我甚至會殺了你！
C’mon, boys and girls! We’ve got a beatdown to give!
來吧，我的同伴們！我們要打敗他們！
Ah. Hah. Hahaha!
啊。哈，哈哈哈！
So be it! My reading is complete – the scars of this battle left in the ancient stone here are a portent of things to come.
就這樣吧！預言已經完成了...這場戰鬥在這裡留下的，這些古老石頭上的傷痕，就是未來的預兆。
Can you suppose what it says? It says I shall lose here, and you shall triumph.
你能猜到它說了什麼嗎？它說我會失敗，你會獲勝。
Hah! Fate has a sense of humor, it seems.
哈！命運似乎有一種幽默感。
Go on. Continue yet deeper. I know my place, and will not stand against destiny any longer.
繼續吧，去更深處。我知道我的位置，不會再違抗命運了。
For my sanity, I will refrain from attempting to divine the results of your future battles. I take my leave.
為了我的理智，我將不再嘗試預測你未來戰鬥的結果。告辭。
Awww, kid, you shouldn’t have.
哦，你不該這樣。
Goin’ all-out? On yours truly? I’m touched. Not even half-honest, either – it’s a treat seein’ you fight.
你對我全力以赴了？我覺得連一半都沒有，你完全就是在享受戰鬥。
Go on. Yez is waitin’ for you. I ain’t too hung up on this whole scheme. Yez’ll turn out fine either way – tough girl.
繼續吧，葉澤拉在等你，我對計劃是否成功並不在意，無論結局如何，葉澤拉都會變成一個勇敢的女孩。
Tougher than me, I swear. So you go do what ya got planned, whatever that is.
一定...比我更堅強，所以你去做你計劃中的事情吧，無論那是什麼。
If ya hurt her, they’ll never find the body, blah blah blah, you know the drill.
還有如果你敢傷害她，屍體永遠都不會被找到，吧啦吧啦吧啦，你知道我要說什麼。
Good luck, kid. Come find me some time afterwards, y’hear?
祝你好運吧，之後再來找我。
...Go. Leave. Now, before I lose my temper.
...走吧，現在就走吧。在我發火之前走。
Is that really what the fate of the universe hangs on? Our relative skill in training Pokémon?
宇宙的命運真的取決於我們訓練精靈的技能嗎？
It’s ridiculous! It’s idiotic! I can’t believe – go! Just go! I should... I should... go.
這太荒謬了！太愚蠢了！我簡直不敢相信...走！走！我應該…我應該…走！
Noted. Excuse me – I fear I may not have provided adequate resistance. I now find myself lacking any means to challenge you.
我知道了，請原諒我...我根本沒有提供足夠的力量，我發現自己沒有任何挑戰你的手段。
...Understood. I have no recourse but to retreat. I wish you the worst of luck in your future endeavors.
…明白了，我別無選擇，只能撤退，祝你接下來厄運纏身。
If you will permit me to leave, I will no longer impede your progress.
如果你允許我離開，我不會再阻礙你的進展。
Goodbye, friend. I hope never to see you again.
再見...還是別再見的好。
Damn it. Damn it!
該死！該死！
I – yeah, that’s how it goes. Never was as good as you. Any of you hotshots.
我...對，就是這樣。我從來不像你們那樣厲害。
Pushed my Pokémon hard to try and get there, and now look at me. Trying to make up for all of it.
我努力訓練我的精靈，試圖達到那個水平，現在...試圖彌補所有過錯。
Sorry, everyone. Sorry, Manaphy. I guess that was it.
對不起，大家。對不起，瑪納霏。我想那就是結局了。
Let’s get y’all back to a Pokécenter, OK? Get you fixed up... I’m sorry...
讓我們把你們送回寶可中心，好嗎？讓你們恢復過來…我很抱歉…
Ugh! I’m – fine! Ow. I think I took a stray shot... oof.
呃！我...沒事！哎，我想我捱了一槍…
Look me in the damn eyes, you dumb grunt! If I was – ow – if I wasn’t... if I wasn’t... I’m feeling a little lightheaded.
看著我的眼睛，你這個愚蠢的傢伙！如果我不是...呃...如果我不是...我...有點頭暈...
Is this why they black out after losing...? I’m gonna... I can’t do this.
這就是他們輸掉之後...會暈倒的原因嗎？我...我要...我不行...
Go do whatever it is you think you’re, like, actually accomplishing. You stupid, stupid dolt...
你這個榆木腦袋...去做...大概...你想做的吧...
But you’re pickin’ a fight with Yez, so I’m gonna leave you with some bruises. You 'bout ready? Put 'em up, kid.
但你畢竟在阻撓葉澤拉，那就留下一些淤青吧。準備好了嗎？放馬過來吧。
You want to get to her, ya go through me. Call me cliché but that’s my line about it.
你想接近她，就得先過我這關，雖然老套，但這就是我的底線。
I should’ve known she was useless.
我早就該想到她沒用了。
Yezera was THIS close. So close to getting everything she wanted. All she had to do was not tell you.
葉澤拉就差一點，就差一點，如果她沒有告訴你，那就能得到一切了。
She had to not be human. Her one redeeming quality: her inhumanity. And now she went and betrayed that, and with it, me.
她就不該是人類，她唯一的可取之處，就是她身上非人性的成分。現在她背叛了它，也背叛了我。
Apparently. It’s sickening, to be honest.
外表上或許吧，但實際上有夠噁心的。
The same shallow, stupid desires as everyone else. I guess I’m just as much of an idiot for believing in her.
和其他人一樣，只有膚淺、愚蠢的慾望，我想我和她一樣都是個白痴。
Yes. Good. For. Her.
對對對，很好。為她高興。
Unfortunately, it isn’t so good for her grand plan, nor mine. I hope the catharsis is worth it.
但這無論是對她的，還是我的計劃都不是好事，希望這種宣洩是值得的。
Yes, she did. I’m glad you’ve realized that.
是的，她做到了，我很高興你能意識到這一點。
Fine. I hope I never see you again.
好吧，希望永遠不會再見到你。
But, well, I’ll take care of her once the regression is complete.
但是，結束之後，我會照顧她的。
You, on the other hand, I’ll deal with now. So long.
但你，我現在就得處理掉，就這樣再見吧。
Do you want me to dispose of your team again? Go on ahead. I can delay you all day.
想讓我再處理你一次嗎？來吧，想多少次都可以。
No!
不！
I want it! I want it so badly!
我需要它！我非常需要它！
I’d – you don’t understand. You don’t understand at all.
我會…你不明白，你什麼都不明白。
How sickened I am at you creatures.
你們這些生物讓我感到噁心。
Fine. You win. Go rendezvous with Yezera.
好吧，你贏了。去和葉澤拉會合吧。
I hope she puts you in your place.
我希望她能讓你明白自己的位置。
If you ever see me again, it won’t end well for one of us.
如果再見面，對我們誰來說都不會好過。
I'm getting the hell out of here.
我要走了。
No.
不。
Yes.
是的。
You stopping me?
你要阻止我？
Get out of my way.
讓開
You think you can?
你覺得你能？
Please, just shut up.
閉嘴吧
Yeah, it does.
那好吧
Don't wanna do this.
我不想這樣
"Dolled up?"
打扮好的？
I'll dance if I want to.
能否起舞由我決定
Not forcing you.
我沒有強迫你
Yeah, I am.
對，來吧
A poem? For me?
給我的詩？
Still creepy, huh?
還是很噁心
Not happening.
不可能
Don't want to fight.
我不想打架
Wait, "non-zero?"
接近於零？
Talked too long already.
說夠了吧
No, I can't.
不行
This is wrong.
這是錯的
Don't hate yourself.
不要自怨自艾
Just give up.
放棄吧
I'm not her lapdog.
我不是她的手下
Do we have to?
必須這樣做？
Sorry.
對不起
Fine, bring it on.
那就來吧
She's human.
她是人類
Good for her.
她做得很好
Yeah, she did.
她做到了
Shut up. For good this time.
閉嘴，是時候算賬了
[Map341]

\PN.
\PN。
Y’know, I pretty much assumed this was going to be a trap, but I didn’t think you’d be here.
我一開始就覺得這是個陷阱，但沒想到你會在這裡。
Well... whatcha doing? Care to explain?
嗯…能解釋一下你在做什麼嗎？
What? You want me to explain this? Velenz? *shrug*
什麼？我解釋這個？夜幽市？*聳肩*
Oh, I know. But you’re the one standing in front of me.
嗯，我能猜到，但現在你是站在我面前的那個人。
Cute. Never should’ve brought a hero here. Heroes are always trouble.
笑話。永遠不要把英雄主義帶到現實中，英雄總是會給大家添麻煩。
*snort* Sure, kid. Whatever you say.
*哼* 隨便吧，孩子，你說什麼就是什麼。
I know you’re here with that girl – Candy? Helena’s had her trackers keeping an eye on her for a while now.
我知道你和那個...叫糖兒的女孩在這裡。海倫娜已經注意她很長時間了。
She hasn’t been causing too much trouble, though, so we let her go.
不過，她並未造成太多麻煩，所以我們也就沒太在意。
Listen, we ran this region. Do you know what that means – taken any political science lately?
聽著，我們統治著這個地區，你應該明白這意味著什麼...你最學過政治學嗎？
It means a monopoly on violence. Every government works the same way.
政治就是需要一些暴力手段，每個政府都是一樣的。
Oh, you can call me a tyrant if you want, but I’m no thief.
你可以管我叫暴君，但我不是小偷。
Yep! And a damn good one.
而且還是一個非常出色的人。
Not an absolute one, though – Andris and Helena made up the other two corners of that triangle.
但也不是絕對的...安德里斯和海倫娜組成了這個地區的另外兩個角。
Not to mention the extensive bureaucracy of Team Chasm at its height.
更別說裂隙隊最鼎盛時期，那龐大且複雜的官僚系統了。
From who? This was a lawless frontier before we came along.
從誰那裡奪走的？在我們來這裡之前，馬凱亞更是一個無法無天的地區。
Only holdouts like Novo truly resisted unification into the larger establishment.
除了最初望新鎮的那群頑固分子，其他人都不抵觸融入我們。
The benefits of being a tyrant. If people are getting in the way, you can convince them to... stop.
成為暴君的好處是什麼？如果有人故意與你做對，你可以“說服”他們停下來。
C’mon. You were raised better than that.
呵，本以為你的家教會更好。
We still rule the region because we ARE the region.
我們仍然統治著這個地區，因為我們就是這個地區。
We’ve got old grunts everywhere who’ll still follow orders if I give them. Helena has her trackers, so we’ve got an intelligence agency.
這裡的每一處土地上都有我們的老兵，只要一聲令下，他們便會服從。海倫娜也有她自己的追隨者，因此我們有了龐大的情報網絡。
And she’s got her claws in LuxTech’s outpost here, so economic development is guided by us.
是她在光華市現在的位置創造了那座城市的一切，並依靠科技發展我們的經濟。
We were a big organization. All-encompassing. And we had to be: lots of work to do.
我們是一個龐大的組織，無所不包，無所不有，因為我們必須得這樣做。
Over just a few decades, we imposed law on this place, created entire new settlements, made it rich and vibrant.
我們用了僅僅幾十年的時間，便在這裡頒佈了法律，創建了人類的聚落，使其變得富有且充滿活力。
We quintupled the population. We dealt with outbreaks, infighting, earthquakes. We secured the support of multiple major companies.
這個過程中，馬凱亞的人口增長了五倍，我們處理了疾病、自然災害，還有一次又一次的內部紛爭，並獲得了多家大公司的支持。
And at the end of the day, we managed to go legit, integrate with the Prizcan government, and aren’t even hated for it.
並最終得以與宏禮市的政府融合，在將混亂控制在最小的情況下，讓一切平穩過渡到現在這樣。
If you want to try and do even a tenth of that without resorting to violence, be my guest.
如果你覺得想要達成這個目標，一點暴力都不需要使用，那就自己試試吧。
We punished people, which you’d call assault. We imprisoned them, which you’d call kidnapping. We taxed them, which you’d call theft.
我們對罪犯的懲罰被視為攻擊，我們對他們的監禁被視為綁架，我們對他們徵稅被視為盜竊。
Oh, sure, people resisted us, but we only acted how a state does.
當然，有不少人反對過，但是國家的發展更加重要。
Candy’s too young to have been around during Chasm’s zenith.
糖兒她畢竟年紀小，沒有經歷過裂隙隊的鼎盛時期。
She’s got a child’s notion of justice, and she thinks that performing her own little acts of violence fixes anything.
她對正義的概念像個孩子，認為自己的小暴力可以解決問題。
Maybe she should ask herself why almost everyone’s fine with us.
我覺得她應該問問自己，為什麼幾乎其他所有人都對我們很滿意。
Yes.
沒錯。
Andris did it for money.
安德里斯是為了錢。
Helena did it for power.
海蓮娜是為了權力慾。
And I did it so I could finally have the resources to properly research the Regis.
我這麼做是為了能有足夠的經費來研究巨人。
Everyone in Team Chasm – in any organization – has their own reasons to be there.
裂隙隊裡的每個人...不管在哪個組織中，他們都有自己的利益訴求。
...We can argue all day, kid. You’re not going to get anywhere.
...孩子，就這個問題，我們可以爭論一整天，但不會有任何進展。
Let me put it this way:
這麼說吧：
a lot of the Pokémon Candy has “rescued” were given to Chasm grunts for combat purposes, but they ended up liking their new home plenty fine.
糖兒所“拯救”的那些精靈，的確是因戰鬥目的而徵收的，但它們也漸漸喜歡上了新的生活。
Maybe talking things out would’ve resolved things better than theft, huh?
你覺得它們真的想回到原主人身邊嗎？就算是，那談判也比偷竊更容易解決問題。
But I know you want to know. What’s up with Velenz? Well, it’s simple. We were trying to work.
我知道你最關心的，還是夜幽市的情況對吧？
I can’t work when I’m being attacked by wannabe heroes. When the power grid is being fried. When Ghost-types are being sent to haunt my lab.
很簡單，我們在正常工作的時候，被一些自稱為英雄的人攻擊了，他們燒燬了電網，並派出幽靈精靈去騷擾實驗室。
We asked, repeatedly, for them to stop. They didn’t.
我們一次又一次地，要求他們停下來，但顯然沒什麼用。
So I took Regigigas and had it carve up the bedrock around here, then dragged some avatars in for good measure.
所以我只能帶著雷吉奇卡斯，去那裡打通地下隧道，並創造出一些化身來保護設施。
They couldn’t prove it was us, but pretty soon they lost their base of operations, and that got the message across.
在我們反攻之後，他們很快就丟盔棄甲了，如今夜幽市的樣子就是這一場騷亂的直接結果。
Yes. Was. If they’d wanted to keep it, they could’ve left us alone.
是的，過去是的。不過如果他們想保住它，只要不來打擾我們就可以了。
Kid, have you ever gotten twelve hours of sleep in a week?
你有過一週只睡12個小時的經歷嗎？
These “freedom fighters” were using every trick in the book. Constantly harrying us. Never a moment’s rest.
這些所謂的“自由戰士”幾乎把你能想到的詭計都用了一遍。在不斷地騷擾下，我們很多人每天只能睡一兩個小時。
Ugh. Makes me mad just thinking about it.
啊...想想就來氣。
I think so, yeah.
我就說吧。
That’s how it goes. Warfare ain’t pretty, but it exists for a reason.
事實就是，戰爭並不美好，但它存在是有原因的。
I did what I did. And if someone wants to “bring me to justice” for it, I say: what does that even mean?
我只是做了自己該做的事，如果有人想要因此“將我繩之以法”，那我只想說：那又怎樣？
I’m breaking my back running this region, making it better every day.
我正在努力經營這個地區，讓它每天變得更好。
You want to throw me in prison? Make this place worse so you can have your petty revenge? Idiocy.
你要把我送進監獄嗎？這隻會讓這個地方變得更糟，唯獨滿足了你小小的報復心。
I know what I did, and I’m not going to do it again. Neither is anyone else.
我很清楚以前做過些什麼，但之後不會，也不需要再做了，當然其他人一樣。
...Now, kid. I need to get out of this place, because I don’t particularly want to run into Candy. Get out of my way.
現在，孩子，我該離開這個地方了，因為我不想碰巧遇到糖兒。
You need to work on your active listening. I didn’t ask you a question.
你需要改善你的思維方式，而且我並不是在詢問你。
I told you what you were going to do… and now you’re going to do it.
我只是告訴你，你現在需要這樣做。
Ugh. Heroes!
呃...英雄？
Damn heroes... well, what’d I really expect.
去特麼的英雄...好吧，我到底在期望什麼？
Get up.
起來。
I’m not angry, just disappointed. But I will be taking my–
我沒有生氣，只是失望。但我會帶走我的...
\PN! Tamarind!
\PN！塔瑪琳！
Stop right there. I – I know I took, um, a little bit to get here, but that’s only because I was eavesdropping!
站住！我...我知道我來晚了，但那只是因為想聽聽你們說什麼！
Candy, is it? Good to meet you in person... I suppose.
糖兒是嗎？很高興親自見到你...大概吧。
You know where I stand. And I know where you do.
你知道我的立場，我也知道你的。
I’ve just settled things with \PN, so why don’t we have a chat in private? \PN, be a dear for me and leave us. I’d like to end this grudge here and now.
我剛剛解決了與\PN的談話，所以為什麼我們不私下聊聊呢？\PN，你先離開一下吧。我想在這裡結束這場仇恨。
...Alright. This is between you and me, anyways. \PN, you can go, like, wait outside.
...這是我們之間的事情，\PN，你可以走了，在外面等一下。
Just for a minute. This’ll be quick.
只需要一分鐘，很快...
Good. Glad we can see eye to eye on this.
很高興我們在這個問題上能夠達成一致。
You first.
你先說。
Not my idea.
不是我的主意。
Getting answers.
尋找答案。
Delivering justice.
追求正義。
Tyrant.
暴君。
You seized power.
你奪取了權力。
And Velenz?
那夜幽市呢？
You don't rule anymore.
你不再統治這裡了。
Not just violence.
不僅僅是暴力。
Some hate you.
有些人恨你。
You did it for yourself.
你是為自己而做。
It was their home.
那是他們的家。
That seems excessive.
似乎有些過分。
Fair enough.
有道理。
...
。。。
No.
不。
...Alright.
...好吧。

Its full of bait to use in fishing.
裡面裝滿了用於釣魚的餌料。
You an angler? Nah, you don't much look the type.
你是個釣魚佬嗎？不，你看起來不像那種人。
More like the type to own a boat!
更像是那種有船一族！
For a fee I can let ya park your boat on the dock out front.
只要你肯付費，就可以在這裡租一個船位。
Alright, just sign here... and, it's legally yours to use.
謝謝惠顧，在這裡簽字...現在，這個船位就是你的了。
Hope your trips on the Eleig are enjoyable!
希望你能喜歡在埃利格的航行時光！
You don't have the cash? My read on you musta been wrong.
你沒錢？難道我看走眼了？
Alright, fair's fair.
好的，謝謝惠顧。
That your boat? Whoooeeeeeh.
那是你的船嗎？哇哦。
It's a real beauty.
這艘船真不錯。
Got any good fishing spots?
有什麼好的釣魚點嗎？
Myself, I got a secret spot up on the Highland Lake.
我在雲上湖有一個祕密釣點。
Or maybe I should say "down" in the Highland Lake.
準確的說，是雲上湖的“下面”。
...maybe I've said too much.
...我說這麼多幹嘛...
[Map346]
It's hard for me to fit in here.
我很難融入這裡。
I was only invited as a reward for most lines of code written last quarter.
我只是因為上季度寫的代碼行數最多才被邀請的。
Is that even such a good metric of productivity? I dunno...
按行算真的合理嗎？我不好評價...
Isn't it a bit peculiar that this house is entirely symmetrical?
這所房子是完全對稱的，你有沒有感覺到很奇怪？
And the mix of Kalosian and Kantonian aesthetics...
雖說融合了卡洛斯和關都的美學...
Maybe you'd disagree, but it rings a mite tacky to me.
或許你不同意我的想法，但我的確覺得很俗。
The most important thing to learn in your life is how to be generous.
人生最重要的，就是要學會對他人慷慨。
I once gave $1,000,000 towards that Pokemon sanctuary west of Velenz.
我曾經向夜幽市西邊的那個精靈保護區捐了$1,000,000。
Just talking about it has got me in a giving mood. Here, take this.
每次談起這件事，都會讓我感到由衷的滿足。這個給你了。
Now now, you wouldn't be asking me to give you another one, would you?
你不會希望我再給你一個吧？慷慨不是冤大頭。
The most important thing to learn in your life is how to be happy with what you have.
人生最重要的，就是學會享受自己擁有的一切。
Welcome, \PN!
歡迎你，\PN！
Oh, I can see the shock on your face.
很驚訝我認識你，對吧。
I recognize you from pictures your mother showed me.
你母親給我看過你的照片。
We meet often at LuxTech events. She's a real business leader, your mother!
我們經常在光華市的集會上見面，她真的是一位榜樣般的商業傳奇！
I think it's fair for me to say that she's an inspiration to all of us.
我相信這裡很多人都是這麼想的。
I hope you enjoy yourself at our little soiree.
我希望你在這個小聚會上玩得開心。
Trainers should just learn to surf with their Pokemon, like they used to.
訓練家們應該學會跟他們的精靈們一起衝浪，就像以前那樣。
Me and my Feraligatr were quite the pair...
我和我的大力鱷就是彼此最好的搭檔...
Nasty business, that thing with the bridge. Good thing I have a boat...
過不了橋可太難受了，還好我自己有艘船...
This piece was sculpted by Noel, the Gym Leader on the eastern half of Prizca.
這個作品是東宏禮市的館主，諾埃爾先生雕刻的。
I can tell just by looking at it!
我一看就知道！
You know, I had a keen interest in Noel even before all that nonsense with Team Chasm.
要知道我在裂隙隊時期之前，就一直在關注諾埃爾了。
I've really hit my stride at LuxTech.
我在光華科技找到了自己的節奏。
Moving smart and talking fast. Striking deals and meeting deadlines.
敏銳地行動，高效地交流，打成目標，滿足期望。
I could never show off my talents in Chasm.
之前在裂隙隊，我並沒能很好地施展自己的才華。
The nerve they had to assign me to the docks, of all places.
那時候他們居然把我分配到碼頭，真是離譜至極！
Here you are, a specialty of the Kalos Region, made fresh this morning!
這是今天早上新鮮製作的，卡洛斯地區的特色美食。
My deepest apologies, it seems we've run out of Galettes.

What in the world is wrong with this thing...
這東西到底出了什麼問題……
You see the scientist struggle with a computer that is rapidly blinking and turns off.
你看到科學家正與一臺快速閃爍並關閉的電腦搏鬥。
There's something up with this computer. If only I had a Porygon to work it out...
這臺電腦有點問題。要是我有多邊獸就好了……
Actually hey, could you go and get me one please?
Actually hey, could you go and get me one please?
I've been needing one anyways, since I work with computers. So please do a trade with me for it, I'll figure out what to get you for it.
反正我也需要一隻，因為我經常和電腦打交道。所以請和我交換吧，我會想想給你什麼作為回報。
Well no rush, maybe it'll mysteriously start working again... and yes, I turned it off and on again.
不急，也許它會神祕地重新啟動……是的，我已經重啟過了。
Ah, alright. Check again with me if you change your mind.
啊，好吧。如果你改變主意了，再來找我。
Thank you, let's get it traded.
謝謝，我們開始交換吧。
You trade over the Porygon. It enters the computer, and a buzzing sound is heard as a Shedinja flies out.
你交換了多邊獸。它進入電腦，隨後一陣嗡嗡聲響起，一隻脫殼忍者飛了出來。
You catch it to prevent it from causing any other trouble.
你抓住了它，防止它再惹麻煩。
What the- it was actually a bug in there? Well damn, okay. You can keep it I guess, the computer is working perfectly.
什麼——裡面真的有隻蟲子？好吧，該死。你可以留著它，電腦現在運行得很完美。
Thank you for this!
謝謝你！
No
不
Yes
是的

I used to do maintanence on the bridge that crosses the Eleig river to the west of here.

With recent events...well, I just hope I'll still have a job.
但現在...我只求自己能保住工作。
I specialize in training Pokemon to surf.
我專門教精靈學習衝浪。
You might look over at Gogoat and think to yourself: "That can learn Surf?"

Yes, yes it can.
沒錯，它能。
My Bibarel, my beloved Bibarel...
我的大尾狸，我心愛的大尾狸…
Why won't you stop chewing on my furniture...

A Nintendo Wii. A kart-racing game is loaded up.
一臺任地獄Wii，並加載了一款賽車遊戲。
...what? You gotta problem with my hair?
…什麼？你對我的髮型有意見？
The only reprieve I have from my awful job is getting to look however I want between shifts.
我唯一能從可怕的工作中得到的喘息，就是在輪班時隨心所欲地打扮自己。
The Bibarel slowly gnaws at the edge of the desk.
大尾狸正在一點點地啃桌腳。
The estuary at the end of the river is so gorgeous.
河口附近的景色真好看。
I love passing through it on my way to Sweetrock Harbor.

鹹鹹的海風，潔白的黃砂岩…一切都那麼那麼漂亮！

Are those things down there even Pokemon?
下面那些東西到底是不是精靈？

有能力跟它們對抗的人都少見，更別說靠近研究了。
My whole team's been running on fumes and the Aid Kit for weeks...
我的精靈們都是靠著急救包和最後一口氣才能支撐這麼久的...
They get KO'd at least twice a day...

Months old lecture notes.
這是一份幾個月前的筆記。

It takes at least five of us at a time to keep the creepy-crawlies from getting out.
在我們五個聯手鎮壓下，才能勉強阻止那些可怕的潛伏者衝出來，
The unscientific reality warping portal just had to open right under one of Makya's most populated places...
誰曾想這個一點不科學的，扭曲了現實的傳送門，就開在馬凱亞最繁華的地方之一...
You got your 'mons ready?
你的精靈準備好了嗎？
It's hairier than a Stoutland down there.
這裡可是比鬥魂場還要危險。

[Map350]
...It’s a Ditto.
…一隻百變怪...
It seems slightly somber, and slightly relieved. It bears a familiar demeanor.
它的神情中有些憂鬱，又帶著些許寬慰，身上還散發出一種熟悉的氣息。
As you approach, it regards you with an uncanny stare, as if it’s peering into your soul.

It seems more than willing to accompany you.

You know that it has the utmost trust in you.

百變怪正耐心等你捕捉它，但也沒有強求。
It will remain here. It likes it here. It’s always liked graveyards.
它會留在這裡，它喜歡這裡，它一直喜歡墓地。
Most of the tombstone's text is unreadable, but you can make out a few words.
墓碑上的大部分文字都已經無法辨認了，但你仍可以看出一些詞語。

未曾終結...在彼時彼刻...
Catch Imogene.

Yay! Now I have a shot at winning the Lainie Award for Staving Off Existential Dread! We’re shooting for eleven years in a row!
耶！現在我有機會再拿一次蘭妮獎，來抵消恐懼了！我要爭取連續十一年優勝！
Oh, what’s that, Necrozma?
哦，這個奈克洛茲瑪...
One day not so far from now you’ll gnaw at the last embers of human civilization? Even our memory will become dust in the cosmic wind?
不久的將來，你會啃食掉人類文明的最後餘燼嗎？即使是我們的記憶也會在宇宙風中化為塵埃？
You’re so silly! I sure am glad to have you everywhere I go!
你真是傻乎乎的！我也很高興你無處不在！
Love... that...
就像...那個...
Hey, person that destroyed the avatar of Necrozma puppeting my body!
嘿，摧毀了奈克洛茲瑪化身所操縱的我的人！
Please go away! Remembering that fiasco is uncomfortable and awkward for both of us!
請離開吧！回想起那場慘敗對我們兩個人來說都很尷尬！
Get. Out. Now. Scram!
滾出去，現在，立刻，馬上！
You. Did not. Just do that. Lainie’s the most generous person in the universe and you spit in her face like this. You disgust me.
你...竟敢...做這種事！蘭妮是全宇宙最慷慨地人，你這樣做，簡直讓我感到噁心。
Get out of my sight. You’re pathetic – you really are! Don’t show your face around here again.
從我眼前消失，可悲的傢伙...不要再出現在這裡了。
Oh, heya!
哦，你好！
It’s so nice seeing a new face around here! You’re \PN, aren’t you? I’ve heard so much about you!
沒想到能在這裡看到新面孔！你是\PN，對吧？我聽說了很多關於你的事情！
I’m Lainie – you might’ve heard about me? I’m kind of a big deal.
我是蘭妮...你或許聽說過？感覺我還是有點名氣的。
Oh good! I’d hate to think that NONE of my friends even mentioned me to you.
太好了，如果所有的朋友們都沒跟你提起過，我可能會有點傷心吧。
Lainie! Winner of the Lainie Award for Staving Off Existential Dread ten years in a row! It’s got my name in it for a reason, you know.
蘭妮！連續十年獲得蘭妮杯恐懼生存獎的人！甚至這獎項都是我名字命名的。
The honor is all mine! I knew you’d drop by sooner or later but I’m still giddy I get to see you in person! The one and only!
榮幸之至，我知道你遲早會來，但我仍然很高興能親眼見到你！
So, we know each other – you know what that means! It’s time to become friends!
所以，我們現在相互認識了...你知道這意味著什麼，是時候成為朋友了！
This is what you do with your friends, right?
接下來就是你和朋友們常做的事情，對吧？
You can’t escape forever!
你不能逃避一輩子！
Yay! Don’t expect this to be easy, though! I’m the best of all my friends... and I’ve got a lot of friends.
耶！不過不要覺得我很弱哦！我有那麼多朋友，而且是其中最強的。
Wow! So you ARE good! You could be one of my bestest friends one day, you know.
哇！所以你真的很棒誒！或許有一天，你可以成為我最好的朋友之一。
Oh, but I’m running late!
哦，但我要遲到了！
I’ve got an appointment to keep – a li’l rendezvous with some old, OLD friends.
我跟一些老朋友們...有一場很棒的聚會。
Adieu, \PN! It’s been lovely! You can go now, though!
再見了，\PN！很高興認識你！你現在可以走了！
Hey! She told you you could leave now. Don’t disrespect my friend like that.
嘿！她說你可以走了，不許如此不尊重我的朋友。
Ugh. Just gonna traipse on through Lainie’s home? Our home? Some friend you are.
呃...你只是在蘭妮家裡閒逛嗎？你這樣還算什麼朋友！
You aren’t gonna get away with this. Think you can just do whatever you want, huh?
你別想就這麼算了，你以為自己可以為所欲為嗎？
Lainie’s reuniting with some old friends right now. Please leave. Immediately. Or else.
蘭妮正在跟老朋友聚會，請立即離開，否則後果自負。
Don’t be surprised if everyone unfriends you after this. Betraying Lainie is beyond the pale. Unforgivable...
如果你要做這種事情，別做好所有人跟你斷絕來往的準備，這是絕對不可饒恕的行為...
Lainie... I’m sorry. I’ll try better next time, friend.
蘭妮...對不起。下次我會做得更好，我的朋友。
Take it.
拿走。
Don't take it.
不拿。
I've heard of you.
我知道你。
Who?
你誰？
It's an honor.
我的榮幸。
Uh, I need to go.
呃，我走了。
Let's do this.
來吧。
[Map352]
Wait... I know that feeling. That’s the feeling I get when someone wants to ask an obvious question!
等等...我知道那種感覺。那是當有人想問一個顯而易見的問題時才會有的感覺！
How did I catch Necrozma anyways? Well, what can I say: I’ve got friends in high places! Ahaha!
我怎麼抓住奈克洛茲瑪的？嗯，我應該怎麼說：我上面有朋友！啊哈哈！
Oh! You’re here!
哦！你來了！
You’re in luck – I just finished my <outln2>reunion</outln2>.
你很幸運...我剛剛結束了這場<outln2>聚會</outln2>。
They still remember me! They still love me! They still <outln2>obey me</outln2>!
他們仍然記得我！他們仍然愛我！他們仍然<outln2>服從於我</outln2>！
And I love them too! I’m gonna show everything how much I love it! I’m gonna wrap up the sun and the moon in a big hug!
我也愛他們！我要向所有人展示我有多愛他們！我要用一個擁抱包裹住太陽和月亮！
And then you! And then everything else! And I’m never going to let them go! You know how I told you I was kind of a big deal...?
接著是你！再者是其它的一切！我永遠不會讓他們離開！要知道我可是個大人物...
I meant it!
我是認真的！
Now don’t be scared! You have everything that makes life worth the fight! Friendship! Love!
現在不要害怕！你擁有值得生命奮鬥的一切！友誼！愛情！還有...
<outln2>Light</outln2>! They’ll all be mine! <outln2>FOREVER!</outln2>
<outln2>光</outln2>！它們都將屬於我！<outln2>永遠！</outln2>
Come back! My friends still have so much <outln2>light</outln2> left to give!
回來吧！我的朋友們還有很多可以賦予的<outln2>光</outln2>！
Hahaha! ENDLESS <outln2>LIGHT</outln2>!
哈哈哈！無盡的<outln2>光</outln2>！
Look at me! Radiant, forever! Bask in it!
看著我！閃耀，永恆！沉浸其中！
The... light... am I OK?
...光...我還好嗎？
Whoa. I remember... some WEIRD stuff!
哇，我想起了...一些奇怪的事情！
Did – Solgaleo and Lunala must’ve bolted. Can’t blame ‘em, hah! I guess I kinda did go a little light-crazy there.
索爾迦雷歐和露奈雅拉逃走了，不過不能怪他們，哈！我是不是過於痴迷光了。
Great question! I have no idea!
好問題！但我不知道！
Something horrible, probably! Fortunately, I’m naturally trauma-immune, so I’ve got that going for me!
或許是一些可怕的事情！但好在，我天生免疫創傷，這是我獨有的優勢！
Okie-dokie! There’s nothing that Lainie can’t spring back from! Even, uh... that.
安心，安心！沒有什麼能夠打敗蘭妮！即使是...呃...那個。
On li’l old Lainie? That’s why it pays to have friends!
對於蘭妮來說，這就是有朋友是有好處的
They’ll never believe you! And even if they did, they’re Makyan police! Don’t worry about it so much!
沒有人會相信你的話！即使他們相信了，他們就是馬凱亞的警察！所以我什麼都不用擔心！
As far as I can tell, my mind was hijacked by an extradimensional intelligence of nebulous nature! I dunno!
在我的感知之中，我的思想似乎被一個模糊的超維度智能劫持了！更具體的就不清楚了！
Maybe avatars of Ultra Beasts work differently – I’m not a scientist! Unless you count my PhD in friendology.
也許超級異獸的化身不太一樣....當然，我不是科學家！除非你把交朋友博士也算進去。
All I know is I came back to Makya with an amazing catch. Next thing I know I want to become friends with the moon and sun!
我知道的內容就是當時帶著一大批收穫回到馬凱亞，然後就想跟太陽和月亮交朋友。
That’s not really out of character for me, though, so nobody noticed anything was wrong!
不過這對我來說並不是什麼不尋常的事情，所以也沒有人覺得有什麼不對勁！
Let me put it in simple terms!
讓我簡單說一下吧！
Lainie go Alola. Lainie come back. Lainie feel weeeeird. Lainie accidentally summon manifestations of sun and moon. Oops!
蘭妮去阿羅拉了，蘭妮回來了，蘭妮感覺很奇怪，蘭妮不小心召喚出了太陽和月亮的化身，哎呀！
OK!
好的！
Aaapaaaarreeeentlyyy.
顯 -------------- 然。
Neeecrooozmaaa.
奈 ------ 克洛 ------ 茲瑪。
Caaan – OK, nevermind.
它能 ----- 好吧，算了。
Apparently Necrozma can call Solgaleo and Lunala from across the universe so it can feed off their eternal light!
顯然，奈克洛茲瑪可以從宇宙的任何地方召喚索爾迦雷歐和露奈雅拉，以便吸取它們永恆的光芒！
Cool! Also, sorry about that one!
很酷！我也對此感到抱歉！
Only legally, and only in Sinnoh! They couldn’t catch me to get me evaluated anywhere else!
只有在合法的情況下，而且只有在神奧地區！他們沒辦法在其他地方對我評估！
Speaking of catching things: that avatar of Necrozma can call Solgaleo and Lunala from anywhere!
但說到這個了：那個奈克洛茲瑪的化身可以從任何地方召喚索爾迦雷歐和露奈雅拉！
And they just show up! To have their endless light, um, ended! Oopsie!
然後它們就出現了！為了讓它們無盡的光芒，嗯...結束！誒呀！
I don’t really get how avatars work! Or how Ultra Beasts work! So I REALLY don’t understand what that Necrozma avatar was doing!
我真的不懂化身的原理！或者說超級異獸的存在原理！所以我也真的不知道，那個奈克洛茲瑪化身在幹什麼！
But thanks for getting rid of it, by which I mean me!
但是感謝你把它...我是說我，給消滅了！
Next time just punch me in the face! It’ll probably work better! Oh, also, you should probably take this so there isn’t a next time!
下次直接打我臉吧！這樣可能會更有效！哦，還有，你最好拿著這個，這樣就不會有下次了！
She hands you a Beast Ball. There is a terrible presence within that threatens to devour all light within the room, and possibly the world.
她遞給你一個究極球，裡面有一股可怕的氣息，吞噬著房間內的所有光亮，甚至還要吞噬整個世界。
It’s probably for the best that Lainie doesn’t have this.
最好還是不要讓它繼續待在蘭妮身邊了。
Cool! Have fun with that thing!
好吧！希望玩得開心！
Try not to let it fuse with sources of boundless energy and scour the land and sky with hellish light!
儘量不要讓它與無盡能量的源頭融合，用地獄般的光芒掃蕩大地和天空！
OK! It’s PROBABLY gone for good anyways, so what’s the harm?
嗯，它可能已經永遠消失了，所以沒有什麼害處？
If you change your mind about the mind-hijacking entity of darkness, just ask anytime!
如果你改變了對此的看法，可以隨時來找我！
Run.
跑。
Fight.
戰鬥。
...What?
啥？
Are you alright?
你還好嗎？
I'm calling the cops.
我要報警。
...W-what?
啥？
Please slow down.
慢點。
Are you insane?
你瘋了？
Take it.
拿走。
Don't take it.
不要。

A strong seedling.

It'll bloom into a tree, if given enough time.

[Map356]
YOU ARE SCUM FOR TAKING THE EASY ROUTE.
如果你選擇投機取巧，那不過就是個人渣。
MIGHT COMES IN MANY FORMS.
力量的形式多種多樣。
MY PREFERRED FORM OF MIGHT IS MUSCLE.
而我的力量就是肌肉！
Haven't seen your face around here before, are you new?
從來沒見過你，新來的？
We'll see if you've earned your place!
那就看看你是否配得上這裡！
Whoa! Looks like a pass with flying colors!
哈，看樣子是順利通過了！
They have... oh well!
他們已經...好吧！
Our job's done, let's go grab some snacks!
我們的任務完成了，去吃點東西吧！
You pass... for now.
你通過了...但是暫時的。
Don't look at me, kid, I just ferry people here.
別看我，孩子，我就是個划船的。
Cheaters don't deserve to be here, but I suppose you'll just clip through me anyways.
投機取巧者不配通過，但我知道你還是會這麼做。
Tread lightly, Trainer. You're on precious ground.
小心點，訓練家，你目前的處境很危險。
This isle is unique, there isn't anywhere with such a collection of magnificent Pokemon.
這個小島是獨一無二的，其他任何地方都沒辦法收集到如此多的精靈。
Latios looks you in the eye. It seems interested in you, fleeting as you may be. Its Pokeball lies below it.
拉帝歐斯緊緊盯著你的眼睛。雖然你可能轉瞬即逝，但它還是將精靈球放在了下面。
Accept Latios onto your team?
要帶走拉帝歐斯嗎？
You both have more important things to do right now. You'll come back later. Or not.
你們現在都有重要的事情要做，或許晚點再來，或許不再回來。
You grab the Pokeball off the ground.
你從地上拿起了精靈球。
Latios enters its ball, its eyes never leaving you.
拉帝歐斯在進入球裡之前，眼睛一直盯著你。
I just wanted to grab a Gible for my team... They've been making me do training for a week straight...
我就是想來抓一隻圓陸鯊...但他們已經讓我訓練了一週了...
NO PAIN NO GAIN! 1000 YEARS OF HISTORY WASN'T SPENT LOUNGING AROUND! THE GUARDIANS WOULD BE DISSAPOINTED!
沒有痛苦就沒有收穫！1000年的時光不是用來閒逛的！守護者會為取巧的行為感到失望！
THE GUARDIANS WILL LIKE YOU TRAINER. YOU AND STRUGGLE ARE CLOSE FRIENDS.
守護者會喜歡你這個訓練家的，你是個懂得奮鬥的好朋友。
This guy is crazy he wakes me up at 4 AM every day to train please help me.
這夥計瘋了，每天凌晨四點叫醒我讓我去訓練，救命！
PRIZCA WASN'T BUILT IN A DAY. THE GUARDIANS BLESS THOSE WHO TRIUMPH, NOT THOSE WHO COWER FROM IMPROVEMENT!
宏禮市不是一天建成的！守護者會祝福勝利者，但不會祝福畏縮不前者！
Please help me he's gonna make me run laps.
救救我，我不想再跑圈了。
Latias greets you with a smile. You've certainly piqued its interest! Its Pokeball lies below it.
拉帝亞斯微笑著向你打招呼。你顯然引起了它的興趣！它的精靈球就在它下方。
Accept Latias onto your team?
要帶走拉帝亞斯嗎？
Latias senses your indecision. No worries! There's always a different chapter in our lives.
拉帝亞斯察覺到了你的猶豫不決，別擔心，生活總有不同的篇章。
Latias' smile grows even bigger. With a twirl, it enters its ball.
拉帝亞斯的笑容更燦爛了。它轉了個圈，進入了球中。
Years ebb and flow, yet it never seems to slow.
歲月荏苒，它從未放緩腳步。
Spend those years wisely, Trainer. There is only so much we can do.
明智地渡過這些時光吧，訓練家，我們能做的，始終有限。
For now though, I think I'll enjoy watching the little monsters here. A good use of our time.
不過現在，我喜歡在這裡的時間，享受跟他們一起相處的每一秒。
Sacred cheating holy crap!
投機取巧有理！
The other guy over there keeps talking about ancient rites and sacred duties and stuff...
那個傢伙一直在談論什麼古老的儀式和神聖的職責啥的...
Wish the guardians mentioned something about ancient ice cream and ancient days off...
守護者們就不會聊聊關於古代冰淇淋和古代休息日的話題嗎...
Things are mild here, a nursery for the wild strength of the future.
這裡的氣候溫和，是孕育野性力量的優秀苗圃。
Strength comes in many forms, but it is quiet here.
力量的形式多種多樣，但在這裡，它是安靜的，
I like that sort of strength, you know?
我喜歡這種力量。
Greetings. The guardians have made me aware of your presense.
守護者讓我得知了你的存在。
I'll admit, I'm not much for words. I don't believe you are either.
我承認，我不怎麼會講話，或許你也跟我一樣。
The Guardians and I await your challenge. Prove your strength, and they might deem you worth of their strength.
我和守護者們正等待著你的挑戰，證明你的力量，證明你的價值。
Very well. The people of this island are strong, but we are rarely in a rush.
很好，這裡的居民們都很強壯，我們一般不會趕時間。
The Guardians beckon those with strength to gather here. That is why the dragons have made this isle their home.
守護者將有實力的人聚集於此，這就是巨龍將這島視為家園的原因。
The Guardians are never wrong, but it is still our duty to prove them right.
守護者永遠不會錯的，但我們仍有責任證明他們的正確。
Begin.

Oh, that's the wrong one. You cheated, not pirated... Can't even pirate a free game...
哦，你搞砸了，這是作弊！即便是免費遊戲，也不能盜版！
Oh, whoa you're actually talking to me...
哦，你在跟我說話嗎...
Most people that pass through here aren't really the chit-chatty type.
大多數經過這裡的人都不愛閒聊。
No.
算了。

帶走。
I need time to prepare.
需要時間準備。

You want a quick and easy start for a team?
你想快速組建一支隊伍嗎？
Try weathers. Set ‘em down, watch ‘em go.
試試天氣隊。設置天氣，然後看它們發揮。
As long as you can manage keeping ‘em up for the match, you can bulldoze most unprepared teams.
只要你能在比賽中保持天氣效果，你就能碾壓大多數沒有準備的隊伍。
Plus, they give you an easy way to shut down the competition’s weathers – just override that sucker with your own.

哦！這裡面有個隱藏開關。
Press the hidden switch?
要試著按一下嗎？

你沒有理會這個開關。
You sense that a small hole has opened up somewhere!
你能察覺到，某個地方出現了一個小洞！

"The heroes of the past tower over us still."
“過去的英雄依然屹立。”
A small logo at the bottom right identifies Bogdan Concrete as the company hired for this project.
從右下方的小標誌可以得知，建設這裡的公司是博登澆築。
The peeps on the TV are saying that the Avatar Crisis is over now.
電視上的人說，化身危機現在已經結束了。
I bet you ain't got much to spend your time on, therefore.
我猜你現在沒什麼事可做了。
Wanna just keep fighting me? I collected a ton of different Pokemon during this journey, so I have a lot of teams I want to try out.
想繼續和我對戰嗎？我在這次旅程中收集了很多不同的精靈，所以有很多隊伍想試試。
Ooh, to spice it up, I should switch to different teams between battles. A surprise every time!
哦，為了增加趣味性，我應該在每場對戰之間換不同的隊伍。每次都有驚喜！
Yeah, I really love the sound of that.
是的，我真的很喜歡這個主意。

Hey...
嘿...
Could I interest you in a Shiny Charm?

Its an item that makes shiny Pokemon more likely to appear to you.
這是一種能讓閃光精靈更容易出現在面前的物品。
I'll part with it for 200 Battle Points.

I'm glad we could come to an understanding.
很高興我們能達成交易。
Adiue, \PN.
再見了，\PN。
Shame. Well, the offer stands.
真丟人，不過提議依然有效。
Which... it looks like you don't have.
這...看起來你點數不夠。
Well, the offer stands.
不過這提議依然有效。
Pick your moves well! It’s not just about hitting hard.
Pick your moves well! It’s not just about hitting hard.
A momentum move like Volt Switch can get a fast Pokémon out before it gets hit or let a slow defensive one take a hit for an ally while switching.
像伏特替換這樣的先制技能可以讓速度快的精靈在受到攻擊前撤退，或者讓速度慢的防禦型精靈在交換時為隊友擋下攻擊。
Stealing or removing items makes most Pokémon way easier to deal with.
偷取或移除物品會讓大多數精靈更容易對付。
Or just go fast with a priority move!
或者直接用先制技能快攻！
They can stop a sweep from being, um, swept, or just get one last punch in before your slow Pokémon go down.
它們可以阻止對手的推隊，或者在慢速精靈倒下前打出最後一擊。
No
不
Yes
是的
Maybe later.
也許晚點吧。
Sure, let's go.
當然，走吧。
[Map358]
Hello to you, young one.
你好，年輕人。
I am Hekata. Known as a historian in some circles, and as a witch in others.
我是經方，某些人管我叫歷史學家，也有很多人管我叫女巫。
Have you delved into the earth of Makya?
你有沒有深入探索馬凱亞的土地？
In the nearby mine I did, and discovered a wondrous secret in its depths: An ore holding ancient powers.
在附近的礦場深處，我發現了一個祕密：一塊蘊含著古老力量的礦石。
By long study of yellowed scrolls in the archives of Sinnoh I finally came to understand its purpose, and my own along with it.
在研究過神奧地區的歷史古蹟後，我終於理解了其背後的含義，並得知了基本的運用方法。
That being: Transmuting Origin Ore into Pokemon thought long extinct in the land of Hisui.
將起源礦石之內的力量，轉化到已經滅絕的洗翠精靈體內。
Speak to me again if you wish to see me perform my spell.
如果你需要我施展這種魔法，就來找我吧。
You need only provide me a chunk of Origin Ore, and I can prepare my spell right away.
你只需要提供一塊起源礦石，我就能完成整個儀式。
Seeking your own destiny, I see. I understand.
我能理解，你也只是在追尋自己的命運。
I am glad that you answered my summons.
很高興你響應了我的召喚。
I suppose now is the time for proper introductions.
我覺得是時候做個正式的自我介紹了。
By long study of yellowed scrolls in the archives of Sinnoh I came to understand Origin Ore, and my purpose along with it.
通過我長期研究神奧的古籍，我逐漸瞭解了起源礦石的一切，以及我接下來要做的事情。
After the more urgent matter is finished, return to me and I will gladly perform my spell for you.
等你把緊急事項都做完之後，再來這裡找我吧，我很樂意為你施法。
Without further ado, let us begin discussing the topic I mentioned in our phone call.
話不多說，我們直接開始正題吧。
For some time now I have been keen to a gathering of magical energy within Mt. Kilna.
我...大概有一段時間了吧...一直關注著基爾納山的能量聚集現象。
I believe the earthquake that shook this region after your championship victory was linked to this.
我覺得你奪冠後的震顫，也跟這件事有一定關係。
However, before I could study the phenomenon in earnest, it dissipated almost entirely.
不過，我還沒來得及，認真研究這一現象的本質，它就悄然消失了。
I've heard through my connections that you may have had something to do with that.
所以...我覺得既然可能跟你有關...
Although, details are scarce.
哪怕只有一丁點關聯，
I ask you now. Would you let an old witch in on the secret?
我也希望你能將其告知於我。
Zounds! What a wondrous story.
這...真是個神奇的故事。
You've witnessed some very ancient magicks indeed.
你親眼見證了古老的魔法。
...Regigigas, the demiurge, the lord golem of legend.
雷吉奇卡斯...傳說中的精靈。
It is no surprise that the very earth would quake in its presence...
地球在它面前震顫，這一切都說得通了...
Allow me to ponder the situation.
請先允許我思考一下。
In my envisioning, primal energy yet lingers in the place you confronted Yezera.
在我的感知之中，原始的能量還縈繞在你和葉澤拉交戰的地方。
If you should return to that spot, you should find some <imp>artifact</imp> of her ritual.
如果你回到那個地方，或許能找到一些她用來祭祀的<imp>工藝品</imp>。
To allow such an object to roam free in this world... t'would be an act of mighty hubris.
讓這樣一個存在在世界上馳騁...真是一種狂妄的行為。
I beseech you, delve once again <imp>underneath Mt. Kilna</imp>, and find it.
我懇求你，再次進入<imp>基爾納山地下</imp>，然後找到它！
Then, return to me so that I can examine it for you.
然後，帶它來見我，我會幫你破解其中的祕密。
I suppose I will merely have to respect your choice in this matter.
不過，至於怎麼選擇，我會完全尊重你自己的意願。
Secrets and I are well acquainted, after all.
畢竟，我和祕密很熟悉。
If the winds of change do blow upon your spirit in this matter, do speak to me again.
如果因為某件事，使變革之風再次吹向你，就再來找我吧。
Do you seek me for my spellcraft? Or is it time to satiate my curiosity on the matter of Mt. Kilna?
你是為了我的法術才來的？還是要滿足我對基爾納山的好奇心？
Very well, let me turn my thoughts to Hisui.
好的，讓我們先將目光放到洗翠。
Have you collected the remnant of Regigigas' magicks?
你找到雷吉奇卡斯的魔法殘餘了嗎？
Delightful! My thanks upon you.
真是太好了，謝謝。
Hand it to me, posthaste.
快拿給我看看吧！
You hand the Primal Clay over to Dr. Hekata.
你將原始粘土交給了經方博士。
Yes! Exactly as expected. This is a most powerful catalyst for ancient magicks.
嗯，跟我預想中一樣，這是古代魔法的強大催化劑。
The very legends of yore should be now at your fingertips.
昔日的傳奇，現在就在你的股掌之間。
You will only need to find echoes of their power to which to attune it.
你只需要找到他們力量的迴音，就可以調整它了。
That task I leave to you, as my body is not suited to the travel that will surely be required.
這個任務依舊要交給你了，因為我的身體狀態不適合長途旅行。
Dr. Hekata hands back the Primal Clay.
經方博士將原始粘土還給你。
As for myself, I should still be able to make use of the Primal Clay's catalytic power.
至於我自己這邊，我應該能利用原始粘土的催化能力。

What I shall need from you is more Origin Ore, of course.
當然，同時需要更多起源礦石。
I shall also need a living creature to study.
還要研究具體的每種生命。
With those requirements, one might even dub this process "cloning."
有了這些前提條件，就能達成人們所說的“克隆”了。
Hahaha, what a thought!
哈哈哈，真是個好主意！
Ahem, regardless...

這些地下墓穴如此古老，幾乎沒有任何書面記錄提到它。
I might just be the first ever artist down here...

Wow, you're really strong! If there really was a Trainer in front of you, you'd show them who's boss!
哇，你真的很強大！不管你遇到什麼訓練家，都可以教教他們誰才是老大！

\PN. I hope you know I had to delay a meeting with the board to be here.
\PN，我覺得你得知道，我是推遲了董事會才能過來的。
Fortunately I have the sway to simply tell people when and where I’ll hold my meetings. I am never late, et cetera.
好在我有權力更改會議時間，這樣我就永遠不會遲到。
You’ve certainly proven yourself. Did you ever get around to demolishing Tamarind?
等下，你現在的確成了冠軍，那你找到毫無保留地痛扁塔瑪琳一頓的機會了嗎？
I’ll have to ask her about it... perhaps open up some old wounds.
看來得找個機會問問她...看會不會讓她破防。
Hmph.
哼哼...
Regardless, you’ve saved our operations in this region.
無論如何，你現在都是這裡的英雄。
As well as this region.
是這個地區的英雄。
And us.
也是我們的英雄。
Thank you.
謝謝。
I plan to inquire with you in the future as how best to handle LuxTech and Mavis... but that’s business. Enjoy the ceremony.
我本來打算問問你，如何處理光華和梅維斯的關係...但那是公事，回頭再聊吧。
Eifion’s Manaphy undulates with excitement upon seeing you. It seems to be more confident than when you saw it last, too.

...An empty seat.
...一個空座位。
Nothing to note here, except for a faint scent. Smells like... clear water, and white flowers...
除了淡淡的香味，沒什麼值得注意的...聞起來像清水，和淡淡的白花...
Hey. Didn’t expect to see me, right?
沒想到會見到我，對吧？
I didn’t expect to be here, honestly. Got the invite from Tamarind and nearly threw it in the trash.
說實話我也沒想到自己會來，接到塔瑪琳的邀請後，我差點順手就扔進了垃圾桶裡。
But I figured, ah, why not? So, uh, I’m here.
但是...呃...轉念一想，我...呃...為啥不來呢？
Good job becoming Champion. I guess?
總之，能成為冠軍代表你幹得不錯。
Gonna be honest: I don’t really know you. But I guess you’re cool, so… yeah, congrats.
其實我並不怎麼了解你，但看起來挺不錯的，所以...還是得恭喜你。
Freeing me from being a gym leader is worth a thousand times more to me than this whole mess.
對我來說，把我從道館館主這個爛攤子上解放出來，才是最重要的事。
Yo! Great to see you again! Man, it feels like it’s been forever.
喲，很高興見到你，老兄，感覺很久沒見過了啊。
Gonna be honest: it’s really damn hard sitting here. Just, like, it was supposed to be me, y’know?
說實話，我感覺坐在這裡很難受，就好像...大概...本該屬於我？
But don’t get me wrong: you earned this. You gave 110 percent.
不要誤會，這是你應得的，畢竟你付出了110%的努力。
Maybe more like 150, honestly. Glad I got to see it.
還是說150%？
Hello, nondescript friend!
你好，不起眼的朋友！
I am studiously not remembering any prior interaction we may or may not have had!
我刻意沒有去回憶，我們之前是不是有過互動！
I am present at this location to support you in whatever endeavor you are here to undertake!
無論你在做什麼，我都會在這裡支持你！
I do this because you are my friend and Lainie does not let her friends down!
我這樣做因為你是我的朋友，而蘭妮不會讓她的朋友失望！
Even if sometimes she really wishes she could just forget about them and the incredibly awkward things they witnessed...
即便她真的希望能忘掉他們，忘掉一些親眼目睹的，令人難以置信的尷尬往事...
It would be totally disrespectful to leave now, while everyone is waiting for you!
現在大家都在等你，你就這麼走了是不是不太尊重？
You done lollygagging? We can get started whenever you want.
玩夠了嗎？可以開始了嗎？
You want me to count the number of seconds we’ve got this room for?
你想讓我數數在這個房間裡待了多少秒嗎？
Because I can. I’ve got a timer set.
而且我還正好帶的有秒錶。
Fine, go. Make it quick, though.
算了，隨你吧，儘量快點。
Let’s get this started. Quick ceremony.
開始吧，快速儀式。
Purely, uh, ceremonial. I don’t even have a trophy to give you.
當然...呃...就只是個儀式，並沒有獎盃什麼的。
Alright…
現在…
With the shockingly broad powers invested in me as Makya’s regional Professor, I hereby –
作為馬凱亞地區的博士，我在此以我的權力...
Is this the part where I say “I object?”
我能說“我反對”嗎？
\PN. You’re looking better.
\PN，你看起來氣色不錯。
Helluva lot better than last time I saw you, to be honest. This place suits you.
說實話比上次見面時好多了，或許是這地方很適合你？
So does not burning the Litwick at both ends.
起碼比燭光靈好一些。
Damn straight!
對！我就說了！
Sorry I’m late – my companion here apparently has some outstanding warrants and I needed to grease a few palms.
首先，我遲到了，因為我的同伴還有幾張逮捕令，我得去打點一下。
You know how it is.
你知道是怎麼回事。
That’s me! But, seriously, c’mon.
真是...他奶奶滴...
You got the title of Champion the second you beat me. You want her to tell you it, or me?
你打敗我後拿到冠軍頭銜，難道還需要我告訴媽媽？
Hahaha!
哈哈哈！
Hey, kiddo. Are you actually glad to see me?
嘿，小鬼，見到我高興不？
I can’t even remember the last time that happened.
我都不記得上次這麼高興是什麼時候了
Oh, but I’m forgetting: this is Zoé.
哦，我忘了：這是佐伊。
You two’ve met, I know.
我知道你們認識。
After I left, I ran into her. One thing led to another, and now we’re a thing. Sorry to break your heart if you were hoping for an edgy industrial goth GF.
競技大會結束後，我遇到了她，然後一來二去，我們就成了。如果你也想找一個前衛的哥特女友，很抱歉傷了你的心咯。
*hiss* The mask’s practical, idiot! And I’m not edgy!
*哼*戴面具是為了實用，而且我也不搞什麼哥特式！
Ugh. If you want edge, I’ll show you edge. Wait till you see me dressed to the nines.
哼，我什麼時候打扮一下，絕對亮瞎你們的狗眼。
He wishes.
想屁吃！
...Ugh. Sorry, that’s reflexive. Yes, we’re dating.
...呃...抱歉，條件反射...沒錯，我們在約會。
*hiss* Leave Mavis out of this.
*哼*跟她沒關係。
I haven’t even met her and I already hate her guts.
雖然沒見過她，但我對她沒什麼好印象。
You talking to me or him? 'Cause we both disappeared for a few months. It’s a long story.
你在跟我還是他說話？至於我們消失的這段時間...
Oh, no, keep going, you three.
我...隨便，你們繼續吧。
I really want to hear more about which of you is dating the gym leader I forgot existed. We’ve got all day.
我也很想知道你怎麼追上一個道館館主的，我們有一整天的時間聽八卦。
Actually, you know what, that’s a good point. Fine, Zain, you were the runner-up.
不過，再怎麼說，贊恩也是今年的亞軍。
You do the ceremony! I finally get to delegate! Now I know what it feels like to be Helena!
那你來主持儀式！海倫娜，我明白你的感受了！
You three gremlins get this figured out. I’m done! I’m out!
你們三個自己來主持，老孃不玩了！
OK, I think it goes something like this.
好嘞，我覺得吧，應該...
With the – what’d she say? – shockingly broad powers invested in me? As, what, your jackass older brother?
她剛才...呃...說的啥來著？我，作為你的混蛋哥哥，
With said powers, I hereby bestow upon you, \PN, the title of Champion.
\PN，在此授予你冠軍稱號。
Y’know, for being a spoiled rich brat and a golden child, you’re actually pretty cool. You want a hug?
要知道，一個被寵壞的富二代，能做到這一步，真的很酷！要來一個擁抱嗎？
Aww, kid. Damn...
你這小子...該死...
*hiss* Sorry. You two are too cute not to join.
*噗嗤*抱歉，你倆太有意思了。
\PN, I promise we’re gonna take care of you from now on whether you like it or not, OK?
\PN，這樣吧，不管你樂不樂意，以後我們都會照顧你，怎麼樣？
Zain and I have been talking about you and Mavis and everything and... yeah. We’re gonna adopt you if we have to.
贊恩一直跟我談論你和你母親，還有之前的其他事情...如果有必要，我們會收養你。
Well, that’s moving a little fast... but, yeah. What she means to say is that I want to make things up to you.
不是...這有點過了...不過，也差不多，反正會補償你就是了。
And that means being there for you.
也就代表，會陪在你身邊。
So, y’know, if things don’t work out with Mavis and you need someone... we’re your family. If you’ll have us.
如果你跟媽媽那邊不順利，如果你還需要的話，我們也依然是你的家人。
Hah!
哈哈！
Don’t worry, I get it. I deserve that.
啊，我知道，這才對。
But, uh, listen, kid: if you need me, I’m here. Same goes for Zoé.
不過，小鬼：如果你什麼時候需要幫忙了，我和佐伊都會出現。
If things don’t work out with Mavis, we’ll be your family. If you’ll have us.
如果你跟媽媽那邊不順利，如果你還需要的話，我們也依然是你的家人。
You never gotta be alone. Alright?
你不會因此而孤獨的。
Of course. You’re welcome, kiddo. Champion. \PN. Whatever you’re called now.
當然，不客氣，小鬼。還是說冠軍？\PN？不管你現在喜歡哪個稱呼。
I can’t promise much, but I’ll be there for you. Things are gonna be different now.
我沒辦法做出太多承諾，但最起碼的陪伴，還是沒問題的。
Love you too. Can’t believe I didn’t for a little while there.
我也愛你。可能在某個時間點不愛你。
But, hey, we can’t change the past, right? Only the future. Things are gonna be different now.
不過，我們沒辦法改變過去，但未來可以，一切都會不同。
I know you will. You’re tough, and you’re smart.
或許吧，你很堅強，也很聰明。
But if you ever aren’t fine, I’m here for you. We are.
但是你也會遇到一些問題，總之，我們都會陪著你。
Things are gonna be different now.
現在已經不同於往日了。
Hey! \PN! Great work!
嘿！\PN！乾的不錯！
I am absolutely STOKED that you got an actual ceremony. I sent Tamarind five letters telling her how disappointed I was that the whole thing got ruined!
很高興這個儀式能夠順利舉行，我之前給塔瑪琳寄了五封信，告訴她我對儀式被毀有多麼失望！
I, uh, also tried to see if Zoé would show up, but she’s still gone. Starting to get worried about her.
我...呃...不知道佐伊會不會出現，她已經消失很長一段時間了，我有點擔心她的情況。
But that’s a me problem! You just relax!
但這是我自己的問題，你只需要休息和放鬆就可以了！
Hello, \PN.
你好，\PN。
The importance of the Champion title is lost on me, but I received an invitation, and had no intention of refusing it.
我不知道冠軍的頭銜有多重要，但我受到了這份邀請，並且不打算拒絕。
Consider this minor show of moral support repayment for your assistance. Congratulations.
就當這是對您的幫助，給予的小小回報吧，祝賀你。
Hey! Lookin’ pretty good. Sorry this took so long to get set up.
嘿，看起來不錯嘛，抱歉花了這麼久才弄好。
We were supposed to get you officially coronated as Champion right after the tournament, but then there was The Incident.
我們本來該在競技大會結束後，就讓你加冕為冠軍的，只是沒想到發生了那種事。
And since it takes eight billion years to get anything through bureaucracy limbo here, it’s... how late is this?
然後還要花80億年通過上面的官僚弄好文件，所以...到底晚了多久？
Three months? Two and a half?
三個月？還是兩個半月？
Oh, and we only have thirty minutes, so let’s keep it moving.
算了，我們只有三十分鐘時間，大家還是快點吧。
Thanks. Can’t help but notice you didn’t say I was lookin’ good... but that’s fair, I guess.
謝謝，但我注意到你並沒說“我看起來很棒”...那就對了，你不需要撩我。
For one, I’m like twenty-five years older than you. And, uh, for two I’ve got some grey coming in.
首先，我大了你二十五歲，其次，我頭髮都白了。
Never let it be said I aged with grace.
雖然我不希望有人說我老了。
But who’s counting? You want me to tell you I’m sorry? You know me well enough to know I’m not gonna.
是誰一天天在數？你想讓我給你道歉嗎？你知道我不可能這麼做。
I’ve had enough on my plate without trying to set up your little victory lap.
我的事情已經夠多了，別再用我給你的勝利鋪路了。
You’re very welcome.
不客氣。
At least someone appreciates the monumental effort I put into this damn region.
至少有人能欣賞到，我對這個該死的地區，付出了多大的努力。
You know how hard it is to get even a single person in a room for half an hour in Makya?
你知道在馬凱亞，想安靜地在房間裡待半個小時有多難嗎？
Everyone’s always scheming or brooding or committing sins.
每個人都心懷鬼胎，不知道打著什麼算盤。
But like I said, we’re on a timer, so let’s get moving.
但是，我們時間不多，所以趕快行動起來。
I know certain individuals who will remain unnamed will have their eyes on their watches the entire time.
我知道某些不願透露姓名的人，會一直盯著手錶看。
Honestly I can’t believe the stars aligned to get everyone I needed in one place for this long. Minor miracle.
說實話，我有點難以相信，在這麼短的時間內，讓所有人都待在這同一個地方。
Anyways! Let’s go, let’s go!
不管怎麼說，開始吧！
Howdy. Hope you ain’t feelin’ stood up.
誒嘿，希望你不會覺得被放鴿子了。
I plan on buyin' you a drink, never you worry. Just ain't been feelin' it with Yez gone.
我本來打算請你一起喝一杯，但是...也沒什麼，就是葉澤拉不在，沒什麼心情。
Part of my mind just ain’t in the here and now. Figured I’d show up for this, at least. I’ve been thinkin’ 'bout you more than I’d like to admit. Hah!
我最近一直有些心不在焉，所以我覺得應該來這裡放鬆一下，我猜你肯定在更深層地揣測我的想法？哈哈！
Don’tcha go givin’ me that look. Go on. Git. We’ll have time enough for chit-chat later.
別用那種眼神看著我，這是你的典禮，之後我們還有很多時間可以閒聊。
Hah. Damn kid...
哈哈，你個臭小鬼...
Hmph. Nice to see you doing well.
嗯，你做的很好。
It was only a walk to get here, and I needed an excuse to get out anyways. I don’t really keep up with current events.
我平時不太關心時事，來這裡也只需要走幾步路，就當找個藉口出來逛逛了。
Guess you did pretty well, though. That tracks. I can see it.
不過想必你幹得相當不錯，這幾天我也從別人口中聽到不少。
Takes a lot to impress me. You do. Keep at it.
能打動我可沒有那麼容易，但你做到了，繼續加油吧。
There’s a letter on the table. The paper smells faintly of perfume, and you know it’s for you.
凳子上有一封信，信紙上有淡淡的香味，你知道這是誰給你的。
“Congratulations. You deserve this. You’re this region’s gleaming star.
“祝賀你，這是你應得的，你是這個地區熠熠生輝的新星。
Make them respect you. Make them worship you. They don’t deserve you.
讓他們都尊敬你，崇拜你，讓他們覺得自己配不上你。
Please accept my utmost apologies for not being able to attend. I still have matters to attend to.
請接受我對未能出席會議的歉意，因為現在還有事情要處理。
Loose ends to be wrapped up – or severed. We’ll be together soon, and then never parted again.
無論持續多久...我們很快就會再會，並從此不再分離。
Ever yours, S.”
永遠屬於你的，S。”
Hats off to you, champ. The moment you first beat me, I knew you were in this for the long haul.
向你致敬，冠軍。從你第一次打敗我那一刻起，我就知道你能堅持到今天這裡。
If only I knew how right I was. I would’ve made some bets! Hah!
如果我知道這次的預感這麼準，我就直接梭哈下注了，哈哈！
There’s a Ditto in attendance. It roils amicably, seemingly glad that its mythical counterpart is taking the attention off of it.
有一隻百變怪也來了，它友好地發出聲音，似乎很高興傳說中的同類，將目光從它身上移開。
It gleams up at you with pinpoint eyes. You’re sure in its head it’s making a joke about you, but not at your expense.
它的眼睛炯炯有神地盯著你，它肯定是在拿你開玩笑。
Ah, my dear \PN. I’ve been watching your ascendance with prying eyes ever since I eloped unto the night.
啊，可愛的\PN。自從你將我帶出黑夜之後，我就一直在注視著你的崛起。
You show such grace and strength! No one could be disappointed with your performance.
你表現得如此優雅，堅強！每個人都會為對的表現滿意。
But there’s someone you wish was here, isn’t there?
但你希望某個人也在這裡對吧？
Never fear! A late entrance is a dramatic entrance, wouldn’t you agree, darling? Ahaha!
別擔心，或許就像戲劇中那樣，只是姍姍來遲，你覺得呢小可愛？
Hey, Champion! Didn’t expect to see me?
嘿，冠軍，沒想到我會來吧？
I’ve been, like, superglued to Tammy’s side the past few months. Couldn’t get away even if I wanted to.
我...大概...這幾個月都被粘在塔米身邊了，想走都走不了。
But, like, I wouldn’t miss it for the world, dummy! Love ya way too much to miss this!
但是，大概...我不可能錯過的，傻瓜！我那麼喜歡你，怎麼會錯過呢！
Your suffering has reached its end! The long, arduous climb has culminated with you at the zenith of Makya!
你的苦難已經結束了！通過這漫長而艱辛的路程，你已經到達了馬凱亞的頂峰！
I hope beyond hope that my tempering has contributed to your victory.
我衷心希望我的錘鍊，為你的勝利做出了貢獻。
Now that role belongs to you! Test all challengers! Test them with fury and frenzy!
現在，這個角色屬於你了！去測試所有的挑戰者，用憤怒和狂熱讓他們成長！
There’s a Mew in attendance. Nobody seems to know what to make of that.
還有一隻夢幻也來了，沒人知道這是怎麼回事。
Personally, the Mew seems to be exulting in being an enigma. It also seems rather proud of you, and its similarly-mutable companion.
夢幻好像對這種狀態很高興，它似乎還在為你，還有它那同樣難以捉摸的同伴而感到驕傲。
Oh, \PN, I’m so happy to see you!
哦，\PN，看到你這麼好我可太高興了！
You deserve to have your victory celebrated. You’ve done so much for all of us. Thank you.
去慶祝你應得的勝利吧，同時也替大家，對你所做的一切表示感謝。
Now go enjoy your time in the spotlight – even if this ceremony is a little smaller than I’d like.
現在去享受你在聚光燈下的時間吧...雖說這個儀式比我想象中簡陋了點。
One sec.
不急。
Yeah, I'm ready.
開始吧。
Zain.
贊恩。
You made it!
你已經說了！
Jackass.
叉出去。
Hey, kiddo.
嘿，小鬼。
Sure you aren't.
沒錯。
You're dating?
你們在約會？
Mavis know?
媽媽知道嗎？
That's where you’ve been?
我還以為你要說啥？
Hug him.
抱他。
Don't hug him.
不抱他。
Thanks, Zain.
謝謝，贊恩。
Love you.
我愛你。
I'll be fine.
我不會有事。
Good to see you too.
很高興見到你。
Two months, twenty days.

An old, beaten up laptop. A couple dozen windows are open all at once.
一臺破舊的筆記本電腦，同時有幾十個窗口被打開了。
Something is being researched, but it's impossible to tell what specifically.
有些還在研究中的內容，但看不懂具體是什麼。
It's Nora's laptop. She must have forgotten it in her hurry to get to Svait.
這是諾拉的筆記本電腦，她肯定是急著去霜皚鎮，忘了帶上它。
A map displayed on the screen shows a path to the west of the Ranger Station there.
屏幕上顯示的地圖上，有一條從霜皚鎮往西走的小路。
“Over 2500 years ago, there existed a sect of itinerant priests who worshipped a Legendary Carver of Clay.
“2500年前，有一個巡迴祭祀教派，一直崇拜著傳說中的粘土雕刻師。
And by its hand, people were able to claim dominion over inhospitable lands high and low.
在它的幫助下，人們才得以在高低崎嶇的荒涼土地上繁衍生息。
Yet, despite their efforts, humanity was cast out from the lands where the primal forces of this world worked.
儘管他們付出了許多努力，但人類終究還是被世界上最為原始的力量趕出了那裡。
Back to the caves; which their species used to call home. Now the caverns would be their tombs…"
洞穴，那是它們曾經的家園，洞穴，那將成為它們的墳墓…"
Guess I forgot to keep the door locked… but I can’t really turn away the esteemed Champion \PN, now can I?
哦？看來我忘了鎖門了…不過我也不能拒絕尊貴的冠軍，\PN，對吧？
I don’t know why you’re here but, if I had to make a guess… you’re searching for something; like I am.
我不知道你為什麼來這裡，但根據我的猜測...你應該像我一樣，在找什麼吧？
Name’s Nora. I like to think of myself as a seeker of knowledge.
我是諾拉，我一般喜歡將自己稱為“知識的探求者”。
I took up a job as a janitor here to gain access to this library, since it’s sealed off to the public.
為了能進入這座圖書館，我特意應聘了這裡的管理員，畢竟這兒並不對外開放。
It’s not trespassing if they’re paying you to be here.
現在我有正經理由待在這裡，就不能算是非法入侵了。
Team Chasm apparently had roots in anthropology, based on all the records they’ve shoved away here.
從他們藏在這裡的記錄來看，裂隙隊顯然也是從人類學開始一點點入手的。
Translated passages with way too many sticky notes go over all kinds of myths and legends.
這些經過翻譯的文獻上，大大小小的全是便籤，其中涉及到各種神話傳說。
One that caught my eye involves the Seekers, those ancient priests I mentioned earlier.
我最在意的還是那些探索者...當然也可以管他們叫古代祭司。
They were ultimately destroyed by a great darkness that some protector deity was apparently equipped to handle.
他們最終被龐大的黑暗能量毀滅，而他們所信仰的守護神，顯然沒有應對這種黑暗的方法。
But, based on the fact that the Seekers disappeared, the guardian must have failed in its duty.
那些探索者就此銷聲匿跡，而這位失職的守護神也不見了蹤影。
Why? I don’t know.
至於具體的原因，我不知道。
The notes here make reference to materials that I can’t find anywhere in this room.
這裡的註釋當中提到了這個圖書館沒有收錄的材料。
I’m thinking that these records have to exist elsewhere.
或許這些記錄存在於其他什麼地方。
And I’m going to assume that they must have been saved digitally, as there’s nowhere else in the region with this much literature.
考慮到裂隙隊，這些文獻有可能是以數字形式保存下來的，不然我想不到它還會在哪兒。
Do you think you can search LuxTech for any servers hosting data from before Team Chasm was established?
你能在光華市的檔案中，搜索到一些裂隙隊解散之前，所存放的數據或者服務器地址嗎？
I’ll keep on searching here in the meantime for something hidden in the stacks.
當然，我也會試著在這裡，找找有沒有其他相關的內容。
Let me know if you find something over at LuxTech.
如果你在光華市找到些什麼的話，就來告訴我吧。
I’ve only been finding fun facts, the kind you’d see on a moving truck.
我這裡只看到一些趣聞，類似在搬家卡車上那種小故事。
Did you know that hexagons were an important symbols of the Seekers?
據說那些探索者的標誌，是一種六邊形。
That’s apparently what inspired Team Chasm’s logo.
恐怕這也是裂隙隊標誌的來源。
You’re back! Excellent.
你回來了！太好了！
I managed to make a breakthrough while you were away.
在你去那邊蒐集材料時，我這裡也取得了突破。
Would you mind showing me what you’ve found first?
能先給我看看你找到了什麼嗎？
You hand over the Old USB Drive.
你將舊U盤交給她。
Nora loads the device on her laptop.
諾拉將其鏈接在筆記本上了。
Fascinating.
太驚人了。
This one file, Project Chrysopoeia Albedo, goes into great detail of a large volcanic eruption thousands of years ago which heavily impacted the region.
這份名為“瑩潤金成計劃”的文件裡，詳細描述了數千年前的一次規模浩大的火山爆發，以及其對該地區造成的嚴重影響。
It makes sense that the large clouds of ash would be devastating to a civilization in its technological infancy.
大量的火山灰對於正處於技術萌芽階段的文明造成了毀滅性的打擊。
This must be the "great darkness" that the Seekers mentioned.
這一定就是“龐大的黑暗”。
Perhaps that’s also why they built what would become the underground ruins; like those found in Mt. Kilna?
或許這就是他們建造地下城市的原因？就像基爾納山發現的那些。
Maybe those places were meant to be safe spaces from the smog?
或許這些地方本就是躲避火山灰影響的安全地帶？
Wait, no. Why would they have built shelters if they had the guardian?
等等，不對勁！他們不是還有守護者嗎？
Hahaha. This is the rush I’ve been seeking.
哈哈哈，這就是我所追尋的！
Questions whose answers are more questions.
問題接著答案，答案又會催生出新的問題。
As for my own findings: I found references to an aboveground ruins site which might lead to what we’re after.
對了，還有我這邊的發現：我找到一個地面廢墟的參考資料，那裡或許有我們要找的東西。
I’ll be waiting for you in <imp>Svait, on the upper level</imp>.
我會到 <imp>霜皚鎮上層</imp>，海拔稍微高點的地方等你。

Wow! It's a Volcanion, trapped inside a large boulder!
哇，是一隻被困在石頭裡面的波爾凱尼恩！
Hey, \PN! Come around to the front.
嘿，\PN！來這邊！
It’s still so striking to me that at any time, Team Chasm could’ve added this protector of the region to its arsenal.
按照裂隙隊的行事風格，他們總會把所有能利用的力量都變成自己的武器，可是...
Sure, they managed to capture Heatran, the Titans, and other oddities I still need to comb that USB about.
就像席多藍恩和巨人們那樣，我還得繼續梳理一下U盤裡的內容。
But were they so dominated by Yezera that they thought Volcanion wouldn’t make a difference?
還是說因為葉澤拉的控制，才導致他們對波爾凱尼恩的態度發生了變化？
It makes me realize how terrifying going against a single person with overwhelming power can be.
這讓我意識到，與一個擁有壓倒性力量的人為敵是多麼可怕的事情。
...as you showed me, \PN.
就像你對我來說，\PN。
Anyway, ready?
總之，準備好了嗎？
Nora brings out a small MP3 player, and presses a button.
諾拉拿出了一個小型MP3，並按下了其中一個按鈕。
A soothing recording of an ancient flute fills the air.
舒緩悠揚的古笛聲響起。
Ah. Seems like we have unwanted guests at this once private concert.
啊，看來有不速之客闖進我們的私人音樂會了。
Awesome. At least they look in the mood to dance.
也不錯，至少它們看起來，也有共舞一曲的心情。
I guess we can crack some heads open, show them a genuine mosh pit experience.
不過我們還是把它們的腦袋敲開，展示一下什麼叫“大場面”吧。
What do you think, \PN?
你覺得呢，\PN？
Ah. I realize now that, while I patched your team up after our battle, I’m out of supplies to heal my own.
啊，有點糟糕，我之前在戰鬥後為你的精靈恢復狀態，結果導致我自身的藥品不夠了。
I’ll be counting on you!
看來只能指望你了！
What a painful cry…
這哭聲…痛徹心扉。
I can’t imagine how it must feel to wake up thousands of years after the disappearance of the people you were meant to protect.
我永遠無法想象，這種在本應保護的人離開數千年後才醒來的痛苦。
I realize now that I’ve only thought about how others would USE Volcanion.
我現在才意識到自己之前只顧考慮別人如何利用波爾凱尼恩了。
As a tool, a reward, or something in that vein…
將其作為工具、武器、獎勵...
I haven't been seeing this creature as a living being.
它是一個活生生的個體。
I saw it as words on a page.
我卻把它看作是一頁文字。
Volcanion seems to be looking to you for guidance.
波爾凱尼恩似乎在等待你的指示。
Take Volcanion with you?
要帶走波爾凱尼恩嗎？
Nora, seeing your intent, comes over and hands you a Poké Ball.
諾拉看出了你的意圖，走過來遞給你一個精靈球。
The Volcanion seems to sigh in relief as it enters the ball.
波爾凱尼恩似乎在進入精靈球的一瞬間鬆了一口氣。
Wonderful.
太好了。
Well, I guess this is where we go our separate ways, \PN.
好吧，也到我們說再見的時候了，\PN。
I hope you don’t mind, but I’m going to keep the USB you gave me.
但我會留下這個U盤，希望你不要介意。
Turning away from it all now would be to live a life knowing what passion is, but never permitting myself to experience it.
現在就這樣放手，也就代表著放棄了就在眼前的，去體會激情歲月的機會。
There are other loose ends left behind by Team Chasm, the Seekers, and who knows what else that I want to see through.
我還想試著去發現更多裂隙隊之前留下的痕跡。
Toodles.
回見。
Volcanion nods. It will wait for you.
波爾凱尼恩點了點頭，它會在這裡等你的。
I still think it’d be for the best if you took Volcanion with you.
我覺得你還是帶走波爾凱尼恩吧。
I’ve spent so much time looking towards the past for answers.
花了這麼長時間尋找答案...
Though, I guess I can keep them company for the time being…
起碼我可以陪陪他們了。
The snow here seems to be heating up directly into steam.
這裡的雪似乎被直接加熱成了蒸汽。
Is this what Svait looked like before Team Chasm did what it did…?
這就是裂隙隊之前在霜皚鎮所做的事情嗎？
The sublimation seems to be a different effect from the subthermal vents in the Svait Sauna.
這裡跟霜皚鎮桑拿室不同，這裡的“水”並未經歷過液態。
But maybe… The sources of those phenomena are the same?
但...或許源頭是一致的？
Yes
帶走
No
算了

A golden fruit glistens in a space atop the tree.
一顆金色的果實在樹頂的空隙中閃閃發光。
A gleaming silver tree. The space at the top is empty of any fruit.
一棵銀光閃閃的樹木，但上面空空如也，沒有果實。
Behind me stand two sides of a similar coin – An arrogant child and a cowardly elder.
我身後站著的是一枚硬幣的兩面，其一是傲慢的孩子，其二是懦弱的長者。
Both too fearful to recognize the harm they cause our King of Kings.
他們都太過害怕了，以至於無法意識到自身給萬王之王帶來的傷害。
But not I! With vigor and wit interwoven, <i>I see the world as it always was.</i>
但我是例外！在活力與智慧的交織下，<i>我看到了世界本來的模樣</i>。
A wonderful battle – nothing short of greatness! But to what do I owe this sudden late.. ness?
一場精彩絕倫的戰鬥！但是...我怎麼在這裡待到這麼晚了...
No matter! <i>You are but a grain of sand against His will.</i>
無妨！<i>在祂的意志中你宛如微塵</i>！
From above, from above! Our great King revealed Himself from above!
自上而下，自上而下！我們偉大的王將於天上顯靈！
Mere prey, my critters and I both - but with a whispered edict and a gentle hand, <i>the meek will rise, by every means they can muster.</i>
我與弱小的生靈皆為獵物，只需要簡單的命令，溫柔的援助，<i>溫順的存在便會想盡辦法站出來</i>。
Awwww… I thought <i>my</i> team was perfect! Oh well, time to go back home!!
啊...我還以為<i>我的</i>隊伍很完美呢！算了，回家了！
Neither heedless trainer nor winged creature <i>shall ever pluck away at His great reign.</i>
無論是不長眼的訓練家，還是那些長著翅膀的生物，<i>都無法破壞他的偉大統治。</i>
Fear, guilt, and shame - a trinity of self-imposed suffering.
恐懼，內疚，還有羞愧 - 三位一體的自我折磨。
They stood as my lifelong companions, but no longer must they.
它們曾是我終身的伴侶，但現在，不再是了。
<i>Fear means nothing under His watchful gaze.</i>
<i>在祂的注視之下，恐懼將毫無意義可言。</i>
O-Oriel..?
奧...奧利爾？
How foolish of you, <i>rejecting greater purpose with such conviction.</i>
你真是愚不可及，<i>竟堅決地拒絕更大的目標。</i>
[Map431]
You might want to slow down, Trainer. These ships are dangerous.
訓練家，你最好慢點，這些船很危險。
Even though I'm on land, my old sea legs are wobbling.
雖然我站在陸地上，但我的“老海腿”卻搖搖晃晃。
Something's off about these boats, and I don't want to be the one that finds the reason why.
這些船有些不對勁，我可不想進去探尋什麼真相。
I hope all my numbing strategies will make you take it slow.
我希望我這些麻木的策略，能讓你稍微慢下一些來。
Never been in a shipwreck, and I pride myself for it.
我從未遇到過海難，我為此而感到自豪。
You get the shivers when you feel like disaster is coming. Guess it comes with experience.
當你察覺到災難的降臨時，你會感到不寒而慄，這，或許就是經驗。

I feel like I see these furniture pieces in a lot of places.
我覺得這些傢俱在很多地方都能用到。
I wonder why.
但是為什麼我搞不清。
My job is to keep things clean, but I'm a big sewers enthusiast.
我的工作是保持這裡的衛生，但我同時也是探險愛好者。
I've been exploring Makya's for years. My dream is to take a trip to see some of tunnels under Kalos.

I caught a few extra Pokemon on my last vacation to Hoenn.
上次去豐緣度假的時候，我多抓了好幾只精靈。
I don't really need 'em, but I REALLY need coffee right now.
但我不是很需要它們，我現在最需要的是一倍咖啡。
I'll trade you one for a cup. I got a Corsola and a Shuckle up for grabs.
我可以用一隻太陽珊瑚或者壺壺，跟你換一杯咖啡。
Dang. Really pegged you as the type to carry around arbitrary cups of coffee.
也對，你怎麼也不像會隨身攜帶咖啡的人。
Oh yeah. That hits the spot.
好耶，直達病根！
Aite, a deal is a deal. Which 'mon are you feeling?
說到做到，你想要哪一隻？
Alright. I'll be here.
好的，我平時都在這裡。
All yours.
這是你的了。
Now to get through the rest of my day...
現在...我得把先完成今天的工作。
No cups? Hmm.
沒有？呃...
These barrels aren't going to inspect themselves...
這些貨物就不能檢查好自己嗎...
This plant has been running since Prizca was still mostly brick and wood.
在宏禮市還是以木屋為主的時候，這家工廠就開始運作了。
A bit interesting that there was a huge uptick in fires when Team Chasm took it over.
不過有意思的是，在裂隙隊接手後，這裡的生產訂單瞬間飆升。
Ah well, I'm paid to think it's a coincidence.
其實我覺得這是巧合啦！
I don't even really work. I just watch the Pokemon do it.
我甚至不需要做什麼，只要盯著精靈們就行。
Sometimes I go out and grab them lunch. It's boring, but the benefits are surprisingly good.
除了偶爾出去給它們買午餐...雖然無聊，但樂得清閒。
Geodude is managing the supply chain! Impressive!
小拳石正在管理供應鏈！
Shh, don't report me. This is the most hidden place in the city. No one ever finds me here.
噓，別舉報我！這是城裡最隱蔽的地方了，這樣他們就找不到我！
Plus, I can torrent whatever I want on the WiFi here.
而且還能用這裡的WiFi隨便下載自己喜歡的內容。
Don't give coffee.
不給。
Give coffee.
給他。
I'll choose later.
我得想想。
I'll take the Corsola.
太陽珊瑚。
I'll take the Shuckle.

There seem to be rocks in here. Does he feed this to his Pokemon?
這裡好像有石頭，他是在拿這個喂他的精靈？
Bence almost has a week of prepared meals in the fridge.
本斯冰箱裡準備了這一週的飯菜。
One day is missing. An empty wrapper seems to have had a "Z" scribbled onto it.
有一天的伙食不見了，空包裝上寫著一個大大的“Z”。
Pieces of hair are at the edges of the sink. This must be where Bence trims that beard of his.
水槽邊有一些掉落的碎毛髮，應該是本斯刮下來的鬍子。
It's an old picture book.
一本古老的圖畫書。
You see a few photos of Bence with a Hoppip and Alolan Geodude.
你可以看到幾張本斯和毽子草以及阿羅拉小拳石的合影。
It seems like they lost a lot of Pokemon battles back then...
那時，他們負多勝少...
[Map443]
Man, that battle really tuckered me out.
我去，這一仗給我累的...
I'm not a stranger to hard work, mind you.
我的體質明明很不錯的。
I went through so much coffee when I was an architect.
之前當建築設計師的時候，經常喝咖啡加班。
I’m the one who came up with the designs for the Ranger Outposts you see all over.
義軍補給站的設計圖，就是我的手筆。
Bless Bogdan Cement for their cheap prices.
還得感謝博登澆築物美價廉的產品。
A dusty, ancient computer terminal.
一臺滿是灰塵的老式電腦。
"EARLY PROJECTS ARCHIVE" is displayed in big block letters at the top of the screen.
屏幕上大大的字寫著：早期項目檔案。
Below that, it prompts you to enter a password.
下面提示需要輸入密碼。
A dusty, old logbook. "Archive Catalogue" is written on the front in black marker.
一本滿是灰塵的舊日誌，上面有黑色記號筆寫的“檔案目錄”。
As you approach, you overhear the men talking back and forth, complaining about the cold and the difficulty of their task.
當你走近時，無意中聽到了有說話的聲音，好像在抱怨這裡的寒冷和任務的艱鉅。
Apparently these are Kurt and Pearce, LuxTech employees.
顯然是光華的員工庫特和皮爾斯。
Jeez, this stuff really is ancient.
誒呀，真是個老古董。
Whose idea was it to let Tamarind name the Projects and Operation files for internal use?
讓塔瑪琳來給內部文件命名的餿主意到底是誰想出來的？
Her naming conventions require a thesaurus to decipher.
她用的那些詞詞典上都不好找！
She always was kind of a slob. Lambert was always cleaning up her messes.
而且她總是邋里邋遢的，需要蘭伯特幫她收拾殘局。
Speaking of, I do wonder how the chop off the old block is doing these days.
既然說到他了，也不知道那老小子最近怎麼樣。
Yeah, we should reach out to him sometime. Rafael too.
是啊，我們應該找機會跟他談談，還有拉斐爾。
We’ve both accrued too much PTO, after all. Haha.
畢竟我們積累的壓力都多過頭了，哈哈哈！
…Don’t you think it’s kinda odd that those two ended up as Gym Leaders?
你不覺得讓他們兩個當道館館主這件事很詭異嗎？
I mean, Lambert, I kinda understand. But Rafael was primarily a scientist.
我...呃...蘭伯特還能理解，但拉斐爾以前就是個研究員。
And that’s not even mentioning Noel. Who is. Noel.
哦對，還有諾埃爾...怎麼想都彆扭。
And we’re… here.
再就是...我們...在這兒...
And it seems we’re not the only ones here. You got something to say, or…?
看來這裡不只有我們兩個啊，你是有話要說…還是...
What? No!
什麼？不可能！
This is a sensitive piece of machinery!
這臺設備非常的珍貴！
There was a whole scrum ceremony covering this.
之前整個會議都在談論這件事。
We can’t just give it away!
我們不可能拱手讓人！
Forget the ceremony, Josh. It’s Mavis’ kid.
別管那什麼會議了，這傢伙是梅維斯的孩子。
So? Helena has been on our behinds for a while and we’ve already pushed this back again and again.
所以呢？海倫娜盯上我們多久了？我們已經不能再推了！
If we don’t do this now, she’ll have someone else do it.
就算我們不做，她也會派別人來的。
And I guess that makes you our "someone else."
然後我們就該 "收拾行李滾蛋"了。
If there’s something you want in this life, you have to take it.
如果你還有想要得到的東西，那就必須留下這個！
Using your own overwhelming strength.
用自己壓倒性的力量。
So, you want us to hand the archive data over to you, huh?
所以，你想讓我們把檔案交給你，對吧？
If there’s something you want in this life, you have to take it. Using your own overwhelming strength.
如果你還有想要得到的東西，那就必須留下這個！用自己壓倒性的力量。
My body’s shaking. I… How did you…?
我...我怎麼...你...竟然...
I guess it really shows that you aren’t just Mavis’ kid anymore.
看來你已經不再只是“梅維斯的孩子”這麼簡單了。
You’re a champion. Through and through.
你配得上冠軍的頭銜。
I’m just glad Team Chasm’s gone.
我只是很高興裂隙隊不存在了。
Imagine if we somehow managed to win back then?
試想一下，如果當年我們贏了，那現在又會是什麼樣子呢？
You’d come around years later and tear what we built down. That’s horrifying.
但真的到了多年後，要將自己曾經建造的東西拆掉時，還是會感到很可怕。
Losing a fight like that reminds you of the good old days, dont’cha think, Kurt?
庫特，輸掉這場對決，會讓你想起以前的美好時光嗎？
You mean having to trudge through the lava filled chambers of an active volcano?
你是說在充滿岩漿的火山洞穴中跋涉的日子嗎？
Yeah, no. I’ll take my cushy office job with air conditioning any day.
哈，我才不覺得那美好，還是讓我坐在辦公室裡吹空調吧。
But, a win’s a win, so here ya go…
總之輸了就是輸了，給你…
This thing is filled with early Chasm data.
這裡面是裂隙隊早期的數據。
When you get the chance, take a look at "Project Chrysopoeia Albedo".
如果你感興趣的話，可以看看"瑩潤金成計劃"。
I remember that one causing the eggheads a lot of pain.
我記得那次大家都吃了不少苦頭。
The ritual to capture the target required a flute that was excavated much later on, in a place no one would ever think to find it.
我們當時需要一支特殊的笛子，來完成捕捉目標的儀式，後來是在一個完全想不到的地方，挖到這個寶貝的。
By that time, there wasn’t a pressing need for that whole song and dance.
但那個時候已經不需要它了，也不再需要那個儀式。
Not with something like Yezera keeping us on our toes.
它並不像葉澤拉那樣，讓我們不得不時刻繃緊神經。
You really gave it your all in that battle.
可以說是拼盡全力了。
It made me realize that I haven’t been giving mine here.
如果只是如此我還沒有在這裡獻愛心的必要性。
Think I’m going to give my two weeks’ notice to Helena. Try my hand at being a Pro Trainer.
我想試著提前預約海倫娜的挑戰，試試當職業訓練家的感覺。
Can you give me that?
能把這個給我嗎？
No.
沒啥要說的。

While it is young, it uses the nutrients that are stored in the seed on its back in order to grow.
經常可見它在太陽下睡午覺的樣子。在沐浴了充足的陽光之後，它背上的種子就會成長茁壯。
To support its weight, Ivysaur's legs and trunk grow thick and strong. If it spends more time lying in the sunlight, it's a sign that the bud will bloom soon.
下盤為了支撐背上的花苞而變得強韌。當待在太陽底下一動也不動的時間變長，就表示大朵的花即將盛開。
Its plant blooms when it is absorbing solar energy. It stays on the move to seek sunlight.
據說充足的營養和陽光會讓花朵的顏色變得更加鮮豔。花朵散發的香氣能夠療愈人心。
From the time it is born, a flame burns at the tip of its tail. Its life would end if the flame were to go out.
尾巴上的火焰代表它的心情。開心時火焰會搖曳晃動，生氣時火焰則會猛烈燃燒。
In the rocky mountains where Charmeleon live, their fiery tails shine at night like stars.
會用銳利的爪子無情地打倒對手。遇到強敵時會興奮起來，尾巴上會燃起藍白色的火焰。
If Charizard becomes furious, the flame at the tip of its tail flares up in a whitish-blue color.
會在空中四處飛翔尋找強大的對手。在面對比自己弱小的對手時，它不會吐出那可熔化一切的高溫火焰。
Its shell is not just for protection. Its rounded shape and the grooves on its surface minimize resistance in water, enabling Squirtle to swim at high speeds.
甲殼的作用不僅僅是用來保護自己。它圓潤的外形和表面的溝槽會減小水的阻力，使它能快速地遊動。
Its large tail is covered with rich, thick fur that deepens in color with age. The scratches on its shell are evidence of this Pokémon's toughness in battle.
長滿蓬鬆毛髮的大尾巴的顏色，會隨著年齡的增長而越變越深。甲殼上的傷痕是強者的證明。
The jets of water it spouts from the rocket cannons on its shell can punch through thick steel.
甲殼上的噴射口能夠精準地瞄準目標。打出的水彈可以命中５０米外的空罐子。
Its voracious appetite compels it to devour leaves bigger than itself without hesitation. It releases a terribly strong odor from its antennae.
或許是想要儘快長大，它的食慾非常旺盛，每天能吃掉１００片葉子。
A steel-hard shell protects its tender body. It quietly endures hardships while awaiting evolution.
殼裡面是黏糊糊的液體。為了準備迎接進化，正在不斷地更新體內的細胞。
Water-repellent powder on its wings enables it to collect honey, even in the heaviest of rains.
翅膀上覆蓋著的鱗粉有劇毒。如果發現有鳥精靈要襲擊綠毛蟲，就會撒出鱗粉將它趕跑。
Evolutionary power has supercharged its wings and their toxic scales, which turn to pure energy at the slightest provocation.
它那巨大翅膀與劇毒粉塵都受到了進化之力的加持，只要受到輕微的刺激，就會化作最純粹的能量。
Predators not warned off by its brightly-colored body are jabbed with the toxic barb on its head.
有著非常靈敏的嗅覺。能用大大的紅鼻子聞出自己喜歡吃和不喜歡吃的葉子。
It remains virtually immobile while it clings to a tree. However, on the inside, it busily prepares for evolution. This is evident from how hot its shell becomes.
雖然掛在樹上幾乎一動不動，但體內卻在為進化而忙碌地準備著。那證據就是它的身體會變得很熱。
It prefers hit-and-run attacks using its powerful poison stingers, trying to evade blows to its fragile body.
大針蜂的領地意識非常強，所以為了安全起見，不要接近它的住處。它一生氣，就會群起而攻之。
Its final evolution has sent its killer instinct into overdrive. It obeys its trainer unfailingly, but will grow impatient without a good fight.
最終形態完全釋放了它的殺戮天性，它會無條件服從訓練家的命令，但如果不能好好打上一場，就會變得不耐煩。
It has an extremely sharp sense of direction. It can unerringly return home to its nest, however far it may be removed from its familiar surroundings.
因為方向感非常好，所以無論離自己的巢穴多遠，都能毫不迷路地飛回來。
This Pokémon flies around, patrolling its large territory. If its living space is violated, it shows no mercy in thoroughly punishing the foe with its sharp claws.
會飛在空中巡視自己廣闊的領地。要是有誰膽敢侵犯它的領地，它就會毫不留情地用利爪狠狠懲治一番。
It spreads its gorgeous wings wide to intimidate enemies. It races through the skies at Mach 2.
有著靚麗羽毛的精靈。有很多訓練家因拜倒在它美麗的頭羽下而來培育大比鳥。
Cautious in the extreme, its hardy vitality lets it live in any kind of environment.
門牙會終生生長。但要是長得太長，就會因無法進食而餓死。
With its long fangs, this surprisingly violent Pokémon can gnaw away even thick concrete with ease.
據說會用後腳上小小的蹼泅水渡海，穿越島嶼來躲避敵人的追擊。
It shows no interest in anything that isn't fresh. If you take it shopping with you, it will help you pick out ingredients.
只對新鮮的東西感興趣。如果帶它去買東西，在挑選食材時會很有幫助。
It makes its Rattata underlings gather food for it, dining solely on the most nutritious and delicious fare.
讓自己手下的小拉達們收集食物，卻只挑裡面營養豐富並且美味的東西來吃。
Farmers whose fields are troubled by bug Pokémon appreciate Spearow for its vigorous appetite and look after it.
生性魯莽，只要是為了保護自己的領地，即便對手是大型精靈，也仍會衝向對手。
Its long neck and elongated beak are ideal for catching prey in soil or water. It deftly moves this extended and skinny beak to pluck prey.
在大嘴雀的領地上拿著食物走動可是相當危險的。食物轉眼間就會被搶走。
Ekans curls itself up in a spiral while it rests. Assuming this position allows it to quickly respond to a threat from any direction with a glare.
甚至可以通過讓顎脫位來吞食比自己更大的獵物。進食後就會蜷縮起身體進行休息。
Transfixing prey with the face-like pattern on its belly, it binds and poisons the frightened victim.
用腹部的花紋讓對手畏縮後，就會快速地用身體勒住對手，並等著對手的心跳停止。
It is not yet skilled at storing electricity. It may send out a jolt if amused or startled.
臉頰上有電力袋。充滿電時就會精神十足地四處玩耍。
This intelligent Pokémon roasts hard berries with electricity to make them tender enough to eat.
有積存電力的特質。在皮卡丘群居的森林裡會落雷不斷，十分危險。
If it stores too much electricity, its behavior turns aggressive. To avoid this, it occasionally discharges excess energy and calms itself down.
隨著電力在體內的積聚，它會越發地具有攻擊性。也有說法講到其實電力就是它的壓力。
Rarely, a Pikachu grows to incredible size instead of evolving into Raichu. It can power settlements so long as it's fed properly.
偶爾會有皮卡丘不會進化成雷丘，而是變得異常巨大。只要餵養得當，就能為居住區提供充足的電力。
It can loose 100,000-volt bursts of electricity, instantly downing foes several times its size.
電擊的威力高達十萬伏特。能一擊擊暈比自己大好幾倍的對手。
It loves to bathe in the grit of dry, sandy areas. By sand bathing, this Pokémon rids itself of dirt and moisture clinging to its body.
棲息在雨量稀少的土地上。遇到危險就會蜷縮起身體，並以此來保護自己柔弱的腹部。
Its claws and horns often break off. The broken claws and horns can be used to carve plows for tilling farm fields.
爪子和角經常會折斷。折斷的爪子和角會被製作成用來耕作土地的用具。
Life on mountains covered with deep snow has granted this Pokémon a body of ice that's as hard as steel.
棲息於被雪包圍著的山嶽地帶，因此獲得了鋼鐵般堅硬的冰雪之軀。
It lives in snowy mountains on southern islands. When a blizzard rolls in, this Pokémon hunkers down in the snow to avoid getting blown away.
很久以前曾棲息在沙漠裡。會用利爪牢牢地插入山體，即便是攀爬冰山也不會滑落。
Its highly toxic barbs are thought to have developed as protection for this small-bodied Pokémon. When enraged, it releases a horrible toxin from its horn.
人們認為它是為了保護自己嬌小的身體才長出了越來越強的毒針。生氣後就會從角尖放出劇毒。
When Nidorina are with friends or family, they keep their barbs tucked away to prevent hurting each other. It becomes nervous if separated from the others.
和夥伴以及家人在一起的時候，為了避免傷及彼此會把刺收起來。離開伙伴後，好像就會變得不安起來。

戰鬥中，速度能力更高的精靈可以率先行動，但有些技能可以改變順序，速度相等時隨機決定先後。
Attacking vs Status
攻擊與變化

Each Pokémon has type weakness and type resistances based on its own type. eg. Water deals double damage to Fire, and Fire deals half damage to Water.
每種精靈都有基於自身屬性的弱點 和抗性，如火弱水 ，水抗火。
Type Combinations

Why Get More?
需培養更多
Having choices of Pokémon is important when facing challenges. A team of six is a bare minimum--it's best to catch more and pull them from the PC as needed.
每種精靈都有根據自己的屬性確定的弱點，因此在應對特定對手時，最好更改隊伍配置。
Methods of Aquiring
精靈獲取
The two main methods of acquiring Pokémon are catching them from the wild, and receiving them from other Trainers through gifts or trades.
The two main methods of acquiring Pokémon are catching them from the wild, and receiving them from other Trainers through gifts or trades.
Catching Basics
捕捉常識
Wild Pokémon will attack you if you walk through patches of grass, dark ground in caves, or other wild terrain. You can catch these Pokémon by throwing Poké Balls at them.
在草叢、洞穴中的黑色地板或者其他特殊地形時，就會遇到野生精靈， 可以通過向它們扔精靈球的方式將其捕獲。
Increase Catch Chance pt. 1
捕獲率 上
Catching a Pokémon isn't guaranteed. It's easier to catch Pokémon when their health has been lowered by your attacks, or when they have a status ailment.
當野生精靈的HP被降低，或者受到異常狀態影響後 ，就能更輕鬆地捉住它們了。
Increase Catch Chance pt. 2
捕獲率 下
Every time a Pokémon breaks out of a ball, it'll be slightly easier to catch for the rest of the battle. You can check what your current catch chance is in the Poké Ball menu.
每當精靈從球裡出來，它的捕捉率都會進一步增加， 而且可以在精靈球的菜單中查看捕捉機率。
Finding Wild Pokémon

What are Style Points?

I'm the Style Points adjuster. How can I help?

Style Points are numbers which have an effect on your Pokemon's stats.
風格點數是影響你精靈屬性的數字。
Pokemon start with 10 Style Points in each of their stats.
精靈的每個屬性都從10風格點數開始。

要為一個屬性增加風格點數，你必須從另一個屬性中移除它們。
Investing into Attack and Sp. Atk is extra efficient: they go up at the same time!

Each stat's Style Points value can go as low as 0, and can go as high as 20.

A Pokemon's Style Point total never changes, but Style Points give bigger stat bonuses at higher levels.

But with every step I take, I find a new reason to check over my shoulder. Whether it's guilt or fear that guides me to that great tower... well. I'd rather not dwell on that yet.
但我每走一步，都會找到新的理由來檢查我的肩膀，究竟是內疚，還是恐懼，指引我走向了那座高塔...算了，還是先不想這些了。<<n>>

Which entry would you like to read?
你想閱讀哪一項？
Everything on your team needs a point. Every Pokémon needs a purpose.
你隊伍中的每一隻精靈都需要一個目標。每一隻精靈都需要一個存在的意義。
If you can't sum up its role on your team in a sentence, keep it in the PC.
如果你不能用一句話概括它在隊伍中的角色，就把它留在電腦裡。
Every bit of that Pokémon should reinforce its role. Moves, items, everything.
那隻精靈的每一個方面都應該強化它的角色。技能、物品，一切。
All six Pokémon on your team need a role, narrow or broad.
你隊伍中的六隻精靈都需要一個角色，無論這個角色是狹窄還是寬泛。
Two Pokémon with synergistic roles are called a "core."
兩隻具有協同作用的精靈被稱為一個“核心”。
If the two of them can take hits from a whole bunch of things, that's a defensive core.
如果它們能夠承受來自許多不同攻擊的傷害，這就是一個防禦核心。
If together they threaten lots of Pokémon and deal with each others' counters, that's an offensive core.
如果它們一起對許多精靈構成威脅並處理彼此的對策，這就是一個進攻核心。
Combine both and you have a balanced core. Good cores make for powerful teams.
將兩者結合，你就有了一個平衡的核心。強大的核心造就強大的隊伍。
You don't need them, but they're a surefire way to give your team some bite.
你不需要它們，但它們是讓你的隊伍更具攻擊力的可靠方法。
The Pokémon you start a fight with is your "lead."
你開始戰鬥時使用的精靈就是你的“首發精靈”。
Start every fight with it and it's a "dedicated lead." Make it a good one.
如果你每次都用它來開始戰鬥，那麼它就是一個“專用首發精靈”。讓它成為一個好的首發精靈。
Its job is to kick things off in your favor from round one.
它的任務是從第一回合開始就為你創造有利的局面。
Usually that's by vomiting up a whole bunch of hazards. Sometimes it sets screens and explodes.
通常這是通過吐出一大堆場地不利因素來實現的。有時候它會設置屏幕然後自爆。
A few just try to delete whatever's on the other side, usually with short-term power boosts like Gems.
有些則試圖直接消滅對方的精靈，通常會使用像寶石這樣的短期力量提升。
Speaking of which, your opponent is going to have their own lead.
說到這個，你的對手也會有自己的首發精靈。
Stop it. Taunt it, put it to sleep, or put it in the ground.
阻止它。嘲諷它，讓它入睡，或者讓它陷入地面。
The arena is going to very rapidly fill up with nasty pointy things.
競技場很快就會佈滿討厭的尖銳物體。
That's because wasting a turn setting them up in the short term pays off big in the long term when they chew up a few Pokémon worth of health over the course of the match.
這是因為，從長遠來看，當這些場地不利因素在比賽中消耗掉幾隻精靈的健康時，前期花費一回合來設置它們是非常值得的。
If you like being alive, pack something that can clean up hazards – Defog, Terraform, or Rapid Spin, usually.
如果你喜歡保持健康，那就帶上一些能夠清除場地不利因素的東西——通常是除霧、攪土翻壤或高速旋轉。
Stealth Rocks are the most common hazard, so prioritize hazard removal if you've got lots of Rock-weak Pokémon.
隱形巖是最常見的場地不利因素，所以如果你有很多岩石系弱點的精靈，就優先清除場地不利因素。
Remember: if your favorite little gremlin is switching out nine times a match or is cripplingly weak to funny pebbles, put Heavy-Duty Boots on it.
記住：如果你最喜歡的那隻小妖精在一場比賽中切換了九次，或者對那些奇怪的小石頭異常脆弱，就給它穿上重型靴子。
They're cute and effective.
它們既可愛又有效。
You exit the PC.
你退出了電腦。

All the little pieces of your team need their own role.
你隊伍中的每一個小部分都需要有自己的角色。
Use whatever you want; just ensure that it's got something to do and the best odds of doing it.
使用任何你想要的；只要確保它有事情要做，並且有最好的機會去做。
Give bulky Pokémon Leftovers and healing moves.
給耐久型精靈攜帶剩飯和治療技能。
Give strong, slow Pokémon Focus Sashes, Vests, or ways to speed up.
給強大但速度慢的精靈攜帶焦點披帶、護符或加速的方法。
You get the idea.
你明白我的意思。
If you can, try to have all kinds of Pokémon on your team, so you have answers to anything.
如果可以的話，儘量讓你的隊伍中有各種各樣的精靈，這樣你就能應對任何情況。
Physical and special bulk and power, type matchups, speed profiles – a diverse team is a diverse toolbox.
物理和特殊耐久、力量、屬性剋制、速度配置——一個多樣化的隊伍就是一個多樣化的工具箱。
Send out the Pokémon that helps everything else on your team first.
先派出能幫助隊伍中其他精靈的精靈。
If you have a weather or a Room to set up, get to it.
如果你有天氣或場地要設置，那就去做吧。
If you don't have a clear, clean gameplan, ruin your opponent's.
如果你沒有一個清晰、乾淨的遊戲計劃，那就破壞對手的。
A dedicated lead's worst fear is usually a strong multi-hitting move. Neither Sturdy nor Sash can help them there.
一個專注的首發精靈最害怕的通常是強力的多段攻擊技能。堅固和披帶都無法幫助他們。
As opposed to simply trading hazards, outspeeding and KOing a lead before it gets going can give you an early advantage.
與簡單地交換場地不利因素相比，在首發精靈開始行動之前，通過速度優勢將其擊倒可以給你帶來早期優勢。
Each Pokémon's utility is defined by the opponent.
每隻精靈的實用性都是由對手定義的。
If your opponent has several Fire-type Pokémon, your Primarina is far more valuable.
如果對手有幾隻火系精靈，你的西施海壬就更有價值了。
Conserve its health and leverage its power.
保存它的體力併發揮它的力量。
In the same match, an Aegislash may be far less valuable – be willing to sacrifice it.
在同一場比賽中，阿羅拉盾甲龍可能就沒那麼有價值了——要願意犧牲它。
There's no shame in letting a Pokémon fall in order to get a safe switch to another.
為了安全地切換到另一隻精靈，讓一隻精靈倒下並沒有什麼可恥的。
While they may seem drastic, moves such as Healing Wish or Explosion can turn the tide of a match in a single turn.
雖然它們看起來很極端，但像治癒願望或自爆這樣的技能可以在一回合內扭轉比賽的局面。
Fainting the user can, if used with finesse, be an advantage – think of them as the ultimate U-Turn.
如果使用得當，讓使用者失去意識可以是一個優勢——把它們當作終極的極速折返。
The Corviknight stares at you intently.
鋼鎧鴉正在盯著你。
You get the sense that you've failed some sort of test.
你感覺自己沒能通過某種測試。

我能...呃...跟你要一個嗎？

為了表達我的感激之情，讓我們一決高下吧！這是一個展示你自己的機會！

然而你手上沒有，據說自然畫廊那邊有存貨，就是東邊的某家店。
